which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the 
offence is alleged to have been committed, wit hout specifying particular items or exact

be sufficient for that purpose.  
Illustrations 
(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain ar ticle at a certain time and place. The charge 
need not set out the manner in wh ich the theft was affected. 
 (b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place, the charge must set out the

out, that portion of the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false. 
 (d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public serv ant, in the discharge of his public functions 
at a given time and place. The charge must se t out the manner in wh ich A obstructed B in 
the discharge of his functions.  (e) A is accused of the murder  of B at a given time and plac e. The charge need not state 
the manner in whic h A murdered B, 
 (f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save from punishment. 
The charge must set out the disobedi ence charged and the law infringed. 
 224. Words in charge taken in sense of  taw under which offence is punishable:  In 
every charge words used in describing an of fence shall be deemed to have been used in 
the sense attached to them respectively by the law under which such offence is 
punishable. 
 225. Effect of errors:  No error in stating either the of fence or the particulars required to 
be stated in the charge, and no omission to stat e the offence or those particulars, shall 
be regarded at any stage of the case as materi al, unless the accused was in fact misled 
by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice. 
 
Illustrations 
(a) A is charged under Section 242 of the Pa kistan Penal Code, with "having been in 
possession of counterfeit coin, having k nown at the time when he became possessed 
thereof that such coin was counterfeit," the word "fraudulently" being omitted in the 
charge. Unless it appears that A wa s in fact misled by this omi ssion, the error shall not be 
regarded as material,  (b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in 
the charge, or is set out incorrectly. A def ends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own 
account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that  the omission to set out the 
manner of the cheating is not material.   

(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner  in which he cheated S is not set out in 
the charge. There were many transacti ons between A and B and A had no means of 
knowing to which of them the charge referr ed and offered no defence. The Court may infer 
from such facts that the omi ssion to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case a 
material error.  (d) A is charged with the mur der of Khuda Bakhsh on the 21
st January, 1882. In fact, the 
murdered person's name was Haider Bakhsh, and the date of the mu rder was the 20th 
January, 1882. A was never charged with an y murder but one, and had heard the trial 
before the Magistrate, which refe rred exclusively to the case of Haider Bakhsh, The Court 
may infer from these facts that A was not mi sled, and that the error in the charge was 
immaterial.  (e) A was charged with murdering Haider Bakhsh on the 20
th January, 1882, and Khuda 
Bakhsh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st Januar y, 1882. When charged 
for the murder of Haider Bakhsh. he was tried for the murder of Khuda Baksh- The 
witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haider Bakhsh- The Court 
may infer from this that A was misl ed, and that the error was material. 
 226. Procedure on commitment without charge or with imperfect or e rroneous charge:         
[Omitted by Law Reforms Ordinance, XIl of 1972].  227. Court may alter charge:  (1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time 
before judgment is pronounced.  (2) Every such alteration or addition sha ll be read and explained, to the accused. 
 
228. When trial may proceed immediately after alteration:  If the charge framed or 
alteration or addition made under Section 227 is such that proceeding immediately 
with the trial is not likely, in  the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his 
defence or the prosecution in the conduct of t he case, the Court may, in its discretion, 
after such charge or alterati on or addition has been framed or made, proceed with the trial 
as if the new or altered c harge had been the original charge. 
 229. When new trial may be di rected or trial suspended :  If the new or altered or 
added charge is such that proceeding immediately wi th the trial is likely, in the opinion of 
the Court, to prejudice the accu sed or the prosecutor as afor esaid, the Court may either 
direct a new trial or adjourn the tria l for such period as may be necessary. 
 
230. Stay of proceedings If prosecution of offence in altered charge require 
previous sanction :  If the offence stated in  the new or altered or  added charge is one for 
the prosecution of which previous Sanction is  necessary, the case shall not be proceeded 
with until such sanction is obtained, unl ess sanction has been already obtained for a 
prosecution on the same facts as those on wh ich the new or altered charge is founded. 
 

231. Recall of witnesses which charge altered: Whenever a charge is altered or added 
to by the Court after the comm encement of the trial,  the prosecutor and the accused shall 
be allowed to recall or resummon, and exami ne with reference to such alteration or 
addition, any witness who may have been examin ed, and also to call any further witness 
whom the Court may th ink to be material.  
 232. Effect of material error:  (1) If any Appellate Court, or the High Court [or the Court of 
Session]  in the exercise of its powers of revisi on or of its powers un der Chapter XXVII is 
of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his defence by the 
absence of a charge or by an error in the charge,  it shall direct a new trial to be had upon 
a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit.  (2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of t he case are such that no valid charge could 
be preferred against the accused in respect of  the facts proved, it  shall quash the, 
conviction.      
Illustration 
A is convicted of an offence, under Secti on 196 of the Pakistan Penal Code, upon a 
charge which omits to state that he knew the evidence, which he corruptly used or 
attempted to use ;as true or genuine, Was fals e or fabricated, if the Court thinks it 
probable that A had such knowledge, and t hat he was misled in his defence by the 
omission from the charge of the statement that he had i t, it shall direct a new trial upon an 
amended charge but if it appear s probable from the proceedi ngs that A had no such 
knowledge, it shall quash the conviction.

person is accused there shall be a separate c harge, and every such charge shall be tried

Illustrations 
A is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another 
occasion. A must be separatel y charged and separately tried for the theft and causing 
grievous hurt.  234. Three offences of same kind within  year may be ch arged together:  (1) When a 
person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same 
person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for,  any number of them not 
exceeding three.

punishment under the same section of the Pakist an Penal Code or of any special or local 
law: 

 
Provided that, for the purpose of  this section, an offence puni shable under Section 379 of 
the Pakistan Penal Code shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence 
punishable under Section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any 
section of the Pakistan Penal Code, or of any special or local law, shall be deemed to be 
an offence of the same kind as an attempt to  commit such offence, when such an attempt 
is an offence.  235. Trial for more than one offence:  (1) If, in one series of acts so connected together 
as to form the same transaction, more o ffences than one are committed by the same 
person, he may be charged with, and tried at  one trial for, every such offence- 
 (2) Offence falling within two definitions:  If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling 
within two or more separate defin itions of any law in force for the time being by which 
offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them ma y be charged with, and 
tried at one trial for; each of such offences.  
(3) Acts constituting one offence, but constituting when combined a different 
offence:  If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves 
constitute an offence, constitute when comb ined a different offence, the person accused 
of them may be charged with, and tr ied at one trial for the offenc e constituted by such acts

Comments 
 
Decision under S. 145(4) and orde r in Form XXII - Distinction. The decision under sub-
section (4) of S. 145. Criminal  P.C. and an order in Form XXIl of Sch. V of the Code, are 
two different things. The decision under sub-sect ion (4) of S. 145 is a decision relating to 
the actual and physical possession of the land in dispute and the order drawn up in Form 
XXII of Sch. V is a final order which is r equired to be drawn up not necessarily to embody 
the decision but to embody the directions of  the Magistrate to the parties concerned. 
Whereas the decision only decides the question of actual physical possession, the order 
confers a right on the party fr om disturbing that possession wit hout taking any steps in due 
course of law.                   .
