PREFACE
The United Kingdom’s constitution, while of ancient origins, remains both
dynamic and vibrant. As every public lawyer is only too aware, nowadays,the proper boundaries of constitutional and administrative law are bothincreasingly wide and subject to debate. In compiling any textbook on thissubject, one of the principal preliminary tasks lies in defining the scope ofmaterial to be included and the approach to be adopted in relation to thatmaterial. The task of writing is made more problematic by the many andvaried depths in which, and the means by which, the subject is taught both inthe United Kingdom and overseas. Full time students; part time students;students on long distance learning programmes such as the University ofLondon’s Programme for External Students and students combining bothconstitutional and administrative law within a one year course, all havediffering needs. The aim in this book has been to provide sufficient detail tomeet all such needs in a user-friendly manner. 
As emphasised in the introductory chapters, the study of the United
Kingdom’s constitutional and administrative law involves rather more than alearning of rules of law, and necessarily encompasses – over and above anunderstanding of legal rules – an understanding of history, government,politics and conventional practices which form the foundations of thecontemporary constitution. As a result, any constitutional and administrativelaw textbook must incorporate sufficient information relating to such mattersso as to enable students to view the constitution in its historical, political andconventional context. In this work, I have addressed the subject in this mannerin order to provide a rounded, contextual explanation of the UnitedKingdom’s constitution, which goes beyond pure law while also adequatelycovering the law.
As previously, the text is divided into seven main parts. Part I provides a
general introduction to the scope of constitutional law, the sources of theconstitution and the structure of the United Kingdom. In Part II, thefundamental concepts of the constitution are considered: the rule of law,separation of powers, the royal prerogative and parliamentary sovereignty. InPart III, the European Union and Community is discussed. The material isdivided into two chapters. Chapter 8 considers the evolution, aims andstructure of the Union and Community and the principal institutions and theirrespective powers. In Chapter 9, the sources of Community law and therelationship between national and Community law are discussed.
In Part IV, the structure of government is discussed, Chapter 10
considering the role of Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Civil Service, Chapter11 discussing the concept of responsible government and ministerialresponsibility and Chapter 12 the devolution of power to the Northern IrelandAssembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly and local government. 
Part V is devoted to the United Kingdom Parliament: ‘Westminster’.
Chapter 13 discusses the electoral system, Chapter 14 introduces students to
vii

the House of Commons. Chapters 15 and 16 are devoted to parliamentary
procedures for the scrutiny of legislative proposals and scrutiny ofgovernment administration. The House of Lords, its role, functions and thecurrent reform proposals are considered in Chapter 17. Parliamentaryprivilege is discussed in Chapter 18. Notwithstanding the devolution ofpowers to regional and local government, Westminster remains technicallysovereign in its law making powers and central to ensuring the accountabilityof the United Kingdom government to the electorate. Nevertheless, the impactof devolution and other constitutional reforms – most notably the HumanRights Act 1998 – is considerable, and introduces new restraints on the scopeof Parliament’s powers, an issue addressed in Chapter 15 in relation to thelegislative competence of Parliament and also Chapter 7 which addresses theconcept of sovereignty.
Part VI focuses on the individual and the state. The materials on civil
liberties are organised into three separate chapters. The rapidly changingnature of constitutional law presents different challenges for each new edition.Whereas the 1998 edition had to accommodate the government’s substantialreform agenda, the 2000 edition was written against the background of thesereforms being largely, if not wholly, complete. With this fourth edition theprincipal area of focus lies in Chapter 19, with the Human Rights Act 1998,which has made an immediate impact on many areas of domestic law andrequired the adoption of different techniques of statutory interpretation andthe development of the common law. The materials on civil liberties aredivided into three chapters. The subject of state security is discussed inChapter 23. 
Part VII introduces administrative law. Judicial review of administrative
action comprises two chapters, the first dealing with the role and scope ofjudicial review and procedural matters; the second analysing the grounds forjudicial review. The complementary role, functions and powers ofCommissioners for Administration are considered in Chapter 26.
Over the years I have accumulated a debt to many colleagues. My
particular thanks in 2002 are to Kenneth Armstrong for his invaluable helpwith the European Union, and to Ian Yeats for reviewing the chapters onjudicial review. As ever, the usual disclaimer applies: any errors remain mysole responsibility. My thanks as ever to Sonny Leong and his team atCavendish Publishing, with whom as before it has been a pleasure to work.Particular thanks go to Ruth Massey, who edited this edition and showedgreat patience and skill with the numerous amendments.
As before, I would like to thank all the students, past and present – both at
home and, particularly, in the Far East – who, over the years, have deepenedmy understanding of the difficulties they face in studying such a rich, variedand essentially protean subject as that of the constitution of the UnitedConstitutional and Administrative Law

INTRODUCTION:
THE SCOPE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
Constitutional law is concerned with the role and powers of the institutions
within the state and with the relationship between the citizen and the state.The constitution is a living, dynamic organism which at any point in time willreflect the moral and political values of the people it governs, and accordingly,the law of the constitution must be appreciated within the socio-politicalcontext in which it operates.
The study of the constitution of the United Kingdom involves acquiring an
understanding of a variety of historical, legal, philosophical and politicalfactors which have, over the centuries, shaped the organisation of the state.The United Kingdom appears to be almost unique in not having a constitutionwhich is conveniently set out in a single written document. Israel and NewZealand share this constitutional feature. However, not too much weightshould be given to the ‘unwritten’ nature of the constitution. Under allconstitutions, not all of the rules will be written, and still less will they becollected within a single document.
In the United Kingdom, by contrast with most other states, the
constitution is the product of many centuries of continuous and, mostly,gradual, peaceful evolution. With the exception of the constitutional turmoilsof the seventeenth century,
1the United Kingdom’s constitutional
development has an unbroken history dating from 1066. Accordingly,historical origins form the background for the study of the contemporaryconstitution, and no meaningful appreciation of the present constitution canbe acquired without understanding this historical backcloth which reveals themoral and political influences which have shaped the constitution as it existstoday. That said, it must always be remembered that the principal emphasis ofstudy is on the contemporary constitution of the United Kingdom rather thanon the many centuries of development which underlie it. With that point inmind, it is necessary to draw on historical sources and events with a view tounderstanding the contribution made to an evaluation of the manyconstitutional issues which present themselves today.
It is particularly true of the United Kingdom’s constitution, which is more
the product of evolution than conscious rational thought, that it is difficult tosee clearly the demarcation lines between constitutional law, history,philosophy and political science. In order, therefore, to study the UnitedKingdom’s constitution successfully, it is necessary to gain an insight into thehistory, politics and political philosophy which underpin the constitution.This task is not easy, particularly as many students will come to constitutional
1 See, in particular, Chapters 2, 6 and 7.

law without a background in history, politics or political philosophy. It is,
however, an essential component of constitutional study, without which thestructure, law and policies of the state cannot be understood. More than anyother area of legal study except jurisprudence, constitutional law in the UnitedKingdom involves far more than a learning of legal rules. Indeed, it may besaid, without exaggeration, that the non-legal rules and practices within theconstitution are at least as important – if not more important on manyoccasions – as the legal rules. For example, in analysing and evaluating theextent to which the individual citizen enjoys constitutional protection ofindividual rights, it is necessary to appreciate the timeless and tireless quest toensure the legal protection of the rights of individuals. This study involves,inter alia, an appreciation of natural law and social contract theories
2which
underpin the constitutional limitations on government power in order that therights of individuals are protected against the power of the state.
Also, by way of example, the study of the constitutional relationship
between the government and the legislature today encompasses a knowledgeof the political backcloth, the rules of parliamentary practice and the non-legalor conventional rules which apply in a given situation. By way of furtherillustration, when studying the legislative supremacy of parliament, it is offundamental importance to grasp that, in terms of classical constitutional legaltheory, the power of parliament – in the absence of a written constitution – isomnipotent or sovereign.
3However, the constitutional and legal fact that
parliament has the ultimate law making power within the state, does notmean that there are no restraints on what parliament may do. The law makingpowers of parliament, while theoretically and legally unlimited, are in factconstrained by the electorate to which parliament is accountable, and byeconomic, moral and political necessities. In terms of accountability to theelectorate and the limits which this imposes on parliament’s powers, it isnecessary to appreciate the philosophical and historical foundations ofdemocracy and the idea of individual rights. Notwithstanding the lack of acodified constituent document, under the constitution of the United Kingdom,the principles on which the government operates today are precisely thosewhich govern the relationship between the government and the people undera written constitution. Here, an understanding of the idea of ‘social contract’
4
makes it possible to understand the complex relationship between ‘sovereignpower’ and the power of the people to determine who holds that sovereignpower and the manner in which it may – and may not – be exercised.
Nowadays, the ‘supremacy’ of parliament in the United Kingdom must
also be considered against the United Kingdom’s membership of theEuropean Union,
5which has significant implications for the classical doctrineChapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law
42 See Chapters 4 and 19.

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
of sovereignty. Since 1972, when the United Kingdom acceded to the
European Community,6the United Kingdom has in many respects ceased to
be an autonomous, independent state and has become a member of an ever-expanding European political, economic and legal order, the impact of whichreaches to the heart of the constitution. In legal terms, it is undeniable that theUnited Kingdom Parliament could decide to withdraw from the EuropeanUnion. It is, however, arguable that, in light of the non-legal restraints –political and economic – there exists little real power to withdraw from theUnion. The non-legal restraints are in fact more important in this regard thanthe simple legal rule that parliament is sovereign in its law making powers.
To illustrate further the distinction between absolute legal power and
practical power, in terms of law, the Crown has the right to appoint the PrimeMinister of its choice, and the power to dissolve parliament when it chooses.
7
To know these rules, however, is not to know very much, for the legal powersof the Crown are restricted – constrained – by non-legal, ‘conventional’ ruleswhich determine the conditions under which the Crown has a discretion toexercise its powers. In order, therefore, to understand issues such as theappointment of a Prime Minister and the rules regulating the dissolution ofparliament, it is necessary to understand the conventional rules which havedeveloped over time and have taken on binding force.
THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM8
‘Constitutionalism’ is the doctrine which governs the legitimacy ofgovernment action. By constitutionalism is meant – in relation to constitutionswritten and unwritten – conformity with the broad philosophical valueswithin a state. Constitutionalism implies something far more important thanthe idea of ‘legality’ which requires official conduct to be in accordance withpre-fixed legal rules. A power may be exercised on legal authority; however,that fact is not necessarily determinative of whether or not the action was‘constitutional’. The doctrine of constitutionalism suggests, at least, thefollowing:
(a) that the exercise of power be within the legal limits conferred by
parliament on those with power – the concept of intra vires – and that those
who exercise power are accountable to law;
(b) the exercise of power – irrespective of legal authority – must conform to
the notion of respect for the individual and the individual citizen’s rights;
56 The original three Communities are now referred to as the European Community. This
forms a major part of the European Union, which came into being under the Treaty on
European Union 1992 (the Maastricht Treaty).

8 See Bogdanor, 1988, ‘Introduction’; McAuslan and McEldowney, 1985, p 11 ff.

Chapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law
6(c) that the powers conferred on institutions within a state – whether
legislative, executive or judicial – be sufficiently dispersed between the
various institutions so as to avoid the abuse of power; and
(d) that the government, in formulating policy, and the legislature, in
legitimating that policy, are accountable to the electorate on whose trustpower is held.
In summary, constitutionalism suggests the limitation of power,
9the
separation of powers10and the doctrine of responsible accountable
government. It is against these conceptual and practical requirements that theconstitution of the United Kingdom must be studied and evaluated.
WHAT IS A CONSTITUTION?
In lay terms, a constitution is a set of rules which governs an organisation.Every organisation, whether social club, trade union or nation state, which hasdefined objectives and departments or offices established to accomplish thoseobjectives, needs a constitution to define the powers, rights and duties of theorganisation’s members. This set of rules, in addition to regulating the internalworking of the organisation, will also make provision for the manner in whichthe organisation relates to outside bodies. It can therefore be said that aconstitution looks to both internal and external regulation of the body towhich it relates.
In addition to the function of defining powers and duties and relationships
with other bodies, a constitution fulfils two related purposes – those ofdefinition and evaluation. In its defining function, the constitution is bothdescriptive and prescriptive (or normative). Differently expressed, theconstitution will both define the manner in which the rules in fact operate anddictate what ought to happen in a given situation. As such, the rule ornormative statement in question sets a standard of conduct or behaviourwhich is regarded as correct and which is expected to be adhered to by thoseto whom the rules are addressed. These constitutional rules – whether writtenor unwritten – facilitate the stability and predictability of behaviour. Further,when such normative rules exist, they provide a standard against whichactual conduct can be judged or evaluated. If the accusation is made that amember of an organisation has acted ‘unconstitutionally’, the speaker isclaiming that those accused have acted in a manner which breaches therequired standards of behaviour as laid down in the body of generallyaccepted pre-determined normative rules. In this sense, a constitutional rule,in addition to being descriptive, normative and predictive, is evaluative andjudgmental.

10 See Chapter 5.

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
7When examining the rules of any organisation, it becomes apparent that
individual rules have differing levels of importance and, moreover, that rules
may have differing degrees of specificity or generality. The manner in whichthe rules are expressed may also differ; some may be written down, whereassome may be discernible only through observation of actual conduct. Andthus it is with the constitution of a state, and particularly that of the UnitedKingdom, in which the sources of constitutional law are varied. The legalsources are represented by a mixture of statute and judicial precedent, andthese legal sources are supplemented by the binding, non-legal, conventionalrules and practices.
11The rules of constitutional law will also reveal
differences in the manner in which they may be changed to adapt to changingcircumstances. Under a written constitution, the constitution will itself definethe procedure for amendment and may provide for varying degrees of ease ordifficulty in amendment in relation to particular rules. The rules regarded asthe most important are characterised by the greatest degree of difficulty in theprocess of amendment. Under the United Kingdom’s constitution, by way ofcontrast, the manner in which constitutional change is effected will bedependent not upon clearly defined written rules but, rather, by acceptedconstitutional practice which has evolved over time.
DEFINING CONSTITUTIONS
Professor KC Wheare defines the constitution of a state as:
... the whole system of government of a country, the collection of rules which
establish and regulate or govern the government. [1966, p 1]
An older definition, that of Thomas Paine, reveals a more complex set of ideas:
A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people constituting agovernment, and a government without a constitution is power without right... A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government; and a government isonly the creature of a constitution. [1792, Pt II, p 93]
From this second definition, it can be discerned that a constitution is
something which is prior to government, or, as Paine expresses it, ‘antecedent’to government, giving legitimacy to the government and defining the powersunder which a government may act. As such, the constitution sets limits bothto the powers which can be exercised and to the manner in which they may beexercised. Accordingly, the constitution defines the legality of power. Thisnotion is particularly apposite in a country with a written constitution and aSupreme Court which is conferred with jurisdiction to rule on the legality ofgovernment action. Under such a constitutional arrangement, it can be saidthat everything which the government does is either lawful or unlawfuldepending upon whether or not the contested conduct is held to be
11 See Chapter 2.

‘constitutional’ or not. Under a largely unwritten constitution, the position is
less clear-cut, and it may often be the case that conduct will be adjudged to be‘unconstitutional’ and yet not be ‘unlawful’. This distinction will be returnedto in a subsequent discussion of the legal and non-legal sources of theconstitution. At this introductory stage, it need only be noted that theunwritten nature of the United Kingdom’s constitution has given rise toargument as to whether or not a constitution – as generally understood in themajority of states – exists. Sir Ivor Jennings, author of The Law and the
Constitution , offers a balanced evaluation of this apparent paradox:
If a constitution means a written document, then obviously Great Britain has
no constitution. In countries where such a document exists, the word has thatmeaning. But the document itself merely sets out rules determining thecreation and operation of governmental institutions, and obviously GreatBritain has such institutions and such rules. The phrase ‘British constitution’ isused to describe those rules.
12
CLASSIFYING CONSTITUTIONS
When looking for the salient characteristics of the constitution, it is helpful to
bear in mind the range of possible classifications which can be applied to anyconstitution. Professor KC Wheare identifies the following classifications(1966, Chapter 1):
(a) written and unwritten;(b) rigid and flexible;(c) supreme and subordinate;
(d) federal and unitary;
(e) separated powers and fused powers; and(f) republican and monarchical.
Written and unwritten constitutions
A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a series of
documents, with or without amendments, defining the basic rules of the state.The origins of written constitutions lie in the American War of Independence(1775–83) and French Revolution (1789). More recent written constitutionsderive from the grant – or devolution – of legislative power from previouslyimperial powers to former colonies and dominions,
13whether secured as a
result of peaceful settlement or violent revolution.14Chapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law
812 Jennings, 1959b, p 36. See, also, McIlwain ,1958; Ridley, 1988.
13 See, eg, the South Africa Act 1909, the British North America Act 1867 (now the
Constitution Act 1867) and the Canada Act 1982.
14 See, eg, the Nigeria Independence Act 1960 and the Zimbabwe Act 1979. See, also, de
Smith, 1964, Chapter 5.

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
The feature which characterises all states with a written constitution is that
there has been a clear historical break with a previously pertaining
constitutional arrangement, thus providing the opportunity for a freshconstitutional start. As Wheare explains:
If we investigate the origins of modern constitutions, we find that, practically
without exception, they were drawn up and adopted because people wished tomake a fresh start, so far as the statement of their system of government wasconcerned ... The circumstances in which a break with the past and the needfor a fresh start come about vary from country to country, but in almost everycase in modern times, countries have a constitution for the very simple andelementary reason that they wanted, for some reason, to begin again ... Thishas been the practice certainly since 1787 when the American constitution wasdrafted, and as the years passed, no doubt imitation and the force of examplehave led all countries to think it necessary to have a constitution. [1966, p 4]
The absence of any such break in continuity in British history, from 1066 to the
current time,15more than any other factor, explains the mainly unwritten
nature of the United Kingdom’s constitution.
The characterisation of constitutions into ‘written’ and ‘unwritten’ is,
however, too limited, for such classification tells neither the wholeconstitutional story nor necessarily makes the constitution accessible to thoseseeking to understand it. A written constitution will provide the basic rules,but, for an understanding of the whole constitutional picture, it is alsonecessary to examine subsequent interpretations of the constitution containedin case law and the political practices which reveal the actual operation of theconstitution. At the heart of this matter lies one simple fact: all constitutions –howsoever defined and categorised – are dynamic organisms. They aredependent for much of their meaning and relevance on the societalframework which surrounds them. Nowhere is this more apparent than inrelation to individual rights and liberties. The vast majority of states haveadopted both written constitutions and Bills of Rights stipulating theinviolable rights of citizens – nevertheless, the political reality for manycitizens’ rights around the world is very different from the formally draftedconstitution. Irrespective of whether or not a state has a written constitutionand a Bill of Rights, it must be recognised that the actual protection ofindividual rights, as with so much of the constitution, is explained not solelyby reference to written rules. Regardless of the form in which rights areprotected, in any society, it will be the democratic political process, politicalpractice and norms of acceptable governmental conduct which, while nothaving the force of law, provide constitutional standards which determine therespect accorded to individual rights.
16These constitutional features also
establish standards against which the probity of official conduct may be

and 7).

the concept of constitutionalism requires a deeper understanding than thatprovided for by an analysis of the formal written rules.
Rigid and flexible constitutions
This classification rests primarily on the question whether or not constitutionscan be amended with ease. The framers of a written constitution,endeavouring to provide a comprehensive legal framework for the state, willnaturally seek to protect its constitutional provisions from subsequent repealor amendment. Towards this end, all or many of the rules will be‘entrenched’, that is to say the constitution will stipulate stringent proceduresto be followed in any attempt to amend the provision in question. As will beseen later, entrenchment may take several forms, but its central characteristicis that it either prevents, or makes difficult, amendment or repeal. By way ofexample, the federal Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of 1900specifies the procedure to be adopted for its own alteration. An amending Billmust pass through at least one House of Parliament by a specified majorityand the proposed amendment must be endorsed in a referendum whichapproves the measure by an overall majority in at least four of the six states.
17
In the 90 years between 1900 and 1990, 42 proposals for constitutionalamendment had been put forward. Of these, only eight were approved by amajority of electors nationally and a majority of electors in a majority of states.In this regard, it has been observed that ‘constitutionally speaking, Australia isa frozen continent’.
18As a further example, under the United States’
constitution, constitutional amendments may be proposed either by a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Congress or, following a request by thelegislatures of two-thirds of the States, by the convention summoned byCongress. To be accepted, the proposed amendments must then be approvedby the legislatures of three-quarters of the states, or by conventions in three-quarters of the states. Between 1813 and 1913, only three amendments hadbeen accepted; between 1913 and 1933 six amendments; and by 1951, only onefurther amendment.
19
The United Kingdom’s constitution, by comparison with the constitutions
of the United States and Australia, represents the height of flexibility. Underthe doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty examined in Chapter 7, parliamentis the supreme law making body and can pass any law, by a simple majorityvote in parliament, on any subject matter whatsoever. Moreover, no courtmay hold an Act of Parliament to be void.

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
under the United Kingdom’s constitution, no legal constraints can – under the
traditional doctrine of sovereignty – fetter parliament’s powers.21Of
particular importance in this regard is the fact that no parliament may laydown irreversible rules regulating future legislative procedures which mustbe followed. The constitutional import of this lies in flexibility. It has beenargued, controversially, and continues to be argued, that the legislativesupremacy of parliament is constrained by various constitutional devices andActs of constitutional importance. However, it is significant that none of thesechallenges has succeeded in limiting parliament’s theoretical power.
The issue of flexibility, however, should not be exaggerated. That there are
no legal restraints on what parliament does, does not mean that there are nonon-legal constraints. In practical terms, such ‘extra-legal’ constraints may beas important as legal controls. By way of illustration of the distinction betweenlegal and non-legal constraints, Sir Ivor Jennings offers the example ofparliament passing an Act which bans smoking in the streets of Paris. As hestates, there is nothing in the constitution which prevents parliament fromdoing precisely that: ‘If it enacts that smoking in the streets of Paris is anoffence, then it is an offence’ (1959b, p 170). The relevant Act so passed wouldbe valid and recognised by the English courts. However, the Act would betotally ineffective and ignored by the courts and everyone else in France.Equally, as Jennings states, ‘if Parliament enacted that all men should bewomen, they would be women so far as the law is concerned’. Sir LeslieStephens, writing in the nineteenth century,
22asks what restrains parliament
from passing an Act providing that all blue-eyed babies be put to death? Theresponse to this question is that in legal-theoretical terms, of courseparliament could pass such a law, but in political terms, it neither could norwould do so, for ultimately, parliament is dependent upon the support of theelectorate.
Supreme and subordinate constitutions
This constitutional category overlaps in many respects, although not totally,with the classification into federal and unitary states. A ‘supreme’ constitutionrefers to a state in which the legislative powers of the governing body areunlimited. Conversely, a subordinate constitution is one whose powers arelimited by some higher authority.

Chapters 8 and 9.

Africa.

Federal and unitary constitutions
In many states, for example, the United States of America, Canada, Australia
and Malaysia, there exists a division of powers between central governmentand the individual states or provinces which make up the federation. Thepowers divided between the federal government and states or provinces willbe clearly set down in the constituent document. Some powers will bereserved exclusively to the federal government (most notably, such matters asdefence and state security); some powers will be allocated exclusively to theregional government (such as planning and the raising of local taxation); andothers will be held on the basis of partnership, powers being given to eachlevel of government with overriding power, perhaps, reserved for centralgovernment. The common feature of all federal states is the sharing of powerbetween centre and region – each having an area of exclusive power, otherpowers being shared on some defined basis. Equally common to allfederations is the idea that the written constitution is sovereign overgovernment and legislature and that their respective powers are not onlydefined by the constitution but are also controlled by the constitution, whichwill be interpreted and upheld by a Supreme Court.
The constitution of the United Kingdom presents a very different
arrangement from that outlined above. The state is unitary and there is nodefining written constitution controlling the powers of government or of thelegislature.
24Instead of a written constitution, there exists a sovereign
legislative body, which represents the ultimate law making power in the state.Power is given to the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh legislatures and tolocal government, under Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, to fulfildefined functions such as the provision of services and raising of localrevenue to finance such services. However, no power is given to the regionsor to local government other than that decreed by parliament. Regionalparliaments and assemblies and local authorities are entirely creatures of Actsof Parliament, and any power given can subsequently – subject only topolitical acceptability to the electorate – be withdrawn. An illustration of thispoint can be seen in relation to the statutory abolition of the Greater LondonCouncil and other Metropolitan Borough Councils in 1985, under the LocalGovernment Act of that year. An example on a larger scale can be seen in thegrant of limited legislative authority to the Northern Ireland Assembly underthe Government of Ireland Act 1920. The law making power given in 1920was later revoked by the United Kingdom Parliament by the Northern IrelandConstitution Act 1973. Similarly, during the 1970s, the Labour governmentplanned to devolve limited legislative power to Scotland and Wales, and Actsof Parliament were passed to this effect (Scotland Act 1978; Wales Act 1978).Neither of those Acts was, however, brought into force, and legislative powerChapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
in relation to both Scotland and Wales thus remained with the Westminster
Parliament.25In 1998, however, devolution of power was again on the
constitutional agenda. The Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act1998 and Northern Ireland Act 1998 each involve a decentralisation of power,although ultimate sovereign power remains with the WestminsterParliament.
26
Separated powers and fused powers
The separation of powers is a fundamental constitutional concept which willbe discussed more fully in Chapter 5. With respect to the classification ofconstitutions, the concept here requires outline consideration. The doctrine isof great antiquity, dating back at least to Aristotle.
27John Locke, Viscount
Bolingbroke and Baron Montesquieu gave further expression to the idea.28
The essence of the doctrine is that the powers vested in the principal
institutions of the state – legislature, executive and judiciary – should not beconcentrated in the hands of any one institution.
29The object of such
separation is to provide checks on the exercise of power by each institutionand to prevent the potential for tyranny which might otherwise exist. Aconstitution with clearly defined boundaries to power, and provisionsrestraining one institution from exercising the power of another, is one inconformity with the doctrine of separation of powers. This arrangement ismost readily achievable under a written constitution, although it is arguablewhether, under any constitution, a pure separation of powers is possible, orindeed desirable, a point which will be returned to later. At the other end ofthe spectrum of constitutional arrangements from a nearly ‘pure’ separation ofpowers is a totalitarian state or a purely monarchical state. Under such aconstitution will be found a single figure, or single body, possessed with thesole power to propose and enact law, to administer the state, and both toapply and to adjudicate upon the law.
Under the largely unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom, the
separation of powers is difficult to ascertain and evaluate. There is undeniablya distinct legislative body, executive, and judiciary, each exercising differingpowers. On further examination, however, it will be found that, in practice,there are so many exceptions to the ‘pure’ doctrine that the significance ofseparation of powers is called into question. Suffice to say at this introductory

Westminster is the geographical area in which parliament is sited.

stage that it is a doctrine which is respected under the constitution, despite
many apparent anomalies. 
Republican and monarchical constitutions
A republic is a state having as its figurehead a (usually) democratically electedPresident, answerable to the electorate and to the constitution. Presidentialoffice is both a symbol of statehood and the repository of many powers. In thename of the state, the President will enter into treaties, make declarations ofwar, and represent the state on formal international and domestic occasions.Additionally, as with the President of the United States of America, thePresident has responsibility for proposing legislation to give effect to thepolitical programme which gave him the mandate of the people. ThePresident, however, has no formal power to initiate legislation, and it is theCongress of the United States which will ultimately determine theacceptability of legislative proposals. It may well be that the elected Presidentis from a different political party than that which dominates Congress.
30
When that political situation pertains, the prospects for successfulimplementation of Presidential election promises is weakened, and althoughthe President has a veto power over legislation passed by Congress, that vetocan be overridden by Congress voting with a two-thirds majority.
Looking at the United Kingdom as an example of a sophisticated Western
democracy based on constitutional monarchy, the position of the head of stateis very different.
31Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, and all acts of
government are undertaken in the name of the Crown. This statement impliesthat great power is accorded to the Queen. In reality, however, and with theexception of important residual powers, this is not the case. As with thePresident of the United States of America, the Queen is the figurehead – thesymbol of nationhood – on a domestic and international level. The Crown alsorepresents the continuity of the state. From an historical constitutionalviewpoint, it matters little which leader of which political party at any onetime occupies the office of Prime Minister, or whether he or she is a Labour orConservative Prime Minister, for he or she will be exercising all powers in theQueen’s name. Unlike the position of the head of state under the UnitedStates’ constitution, however, the Queen is, by definition, unelected andunaccountable to the electorate in any democratic sense. The Crown enjoysenormous legal-theoretical power but little practical power, save inexceptional circumstances.
The legal powers held by the Crown are, for the most part,
32exercised in
her name by the elected government of the day. The rules which restrict theChapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Introduction: The Scope of Constitutional Law
15monarch’s powers are for the most part non-legal. The restrictions comprise
the all-important conventional rules of constitutional practice which regulateso much of the United Kingdom’s constitution. Thus, for example, the Crownhas the legal power to withhold the royal assent from Bills passed byparliament but, by convention, this assent will never be withheld (and has notbeen withheld since 1708) unless so advised by the government.
In addition to representing the symbolic figurehead, the role of the Crown
may be said to be protective. The Queen, it has been said, has the power to‘warn and advise’ the Prime Minister of the day.
33Queen Elizabeth II, since
her accession in 1952, has seen many Prime Ministers, both Conservative andLabour, enter and leave office. Throughout that 50 year reign, the Queen hasquietly influenced government,
34and garnered vast experience in domestic,
international and particularly Commonwealth affairs. That experiencerepresents a wealth of knowledge at the disposal of the government in power.While the role of the monarchy is a matter for contemporary debate, thecontinuity and longevity of monarchy remains a distinguishing feature of theUnited Kingdom’s constitution.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM’S CONSTITUTION
From the discussion of classification above, some conclusions can now bereached about the characteristics of the United Kingdom’s constitution. Insummary, it can be said that it:
(a) is largely unwritten in character;(b) is flexible in nature;(c) is supreme;
(d) is unitary in structure, but, following the 1998 reforms, with some powers
devolved to a Scottish Parliament, to a Welsh Assembly, to the new
Northern Ireland Assembly and to local government;
(e) exhibits mainly but not completely separated powers; and
(f) is monarchical.
Each of these features will become clearer as we examine the constitution in
more detail.
THE CONSTITUTION IN FLUX
The absence of a written constitution, allied to the doctrine of parliamentarysovereignty, enables constitutional change to be brought about within the
33 Bagehot (1867), 1993, Chapter II.
34 See Macmillan (1961–63), 1973; Wilson, 1976.

United Kingdom with the minimum of constitutional formality. The
constitution has evolved in a pragmatic and gradual manner over thecenturies. At the current time, however, the constitution is undergoing moremajor change than in previous decades. The last and greatest constitutionalchange occurred in 1973 when the United Kingdom joined the EuropeanCommunities.
35Joining the Community, which has now evolved as but one
part of the wider European Union, involved not only entering into anagreement which affected the economic life of the country, but also joining aunique legal order under which rights and obligations in matters regulated bythe treaties are ultimately defined and enforced by the European Court ofJustice. Moreover, the Treaties on European Union 1992 and 1997 mark newand significant developments within the European Union in relation toeconomic, monetary and political union and the evolution of common policiesin relation to co-operation in judicial and policing matters, home affairs andsecurity and foreign affairs policies.
It was the general election of 1997 which presaged further significant
constitutional change. The incoming Labour government had committed itselfto several constitutional reforms. Devolution of limited, but nonetheless wideranging, law making powers to Scotland and Wales was the first issue to beaddressed by the government.
36An elected ‘strategic authority’ for London
was also on the agenda, as was regional devolution in England. Reform of themembership of the House of Lords, the ‘upper House’ of the UnitedKingdom’s bicameral parliament, has already been effected, although theultimate role and powers of the Lords remains to be determined. Thesettlement reached in April 1998 with regard to Northern Ireland hasculminated in devolved powers to a new Northern Ireland Assembly. Thegovernment was also committed to the better protection of rights andfreedoms, and in order to achieve this objective, the Human Rights Act 1998‘incorporated’ the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law,thereby for the first time providing a ‘code’ of human rights which is not onlybinding on public authorities and the courts and compels ministers to makedeclarations of compatibility or incompatibility with Conventionrequirements when presenting Bills to parliament, but also provides citizenswith the legal means by which to challenge the legality of administrativeaction. As significantly, the Human Rights Act marks a change in perceptionabout freedoms and rights among the British people who, by contrast withcitizens living under written constitutions and Bills of Rights, have hithertobeen largely unaware of their rights and freedoms. Chapter 1: Constitutional and Administrative Law
1635 Now European Community; see, further, Chapters 8 and 9.
36 On devolution to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, see Chapter 12.

CHAPTER 2
As has been seen in Chapter 1, the United Kingdom’s constitution is classified
as ‘unwritten’. However, while there is no single constituent document, manyconstitutional sources are of a written nature, albeit not convenientlycompiled within any one document. In order to give meaning to theconstitution as a whole, it is necessary to study the many fundamentaldocuments, statutes and cases together with the non-legal conventional ruleswhich surround and give meaning to the legal rules. In undertaking thisexercise, it must be remembered that what is being sought is not a rote-learned catalogue of sources, but rather a broad appreciation of theconstituent elements of the constitution. 
DEFINITIONAL DIFFICULTIES
Defining the scope of sources which are correctly labelled ‘constitutional’under an unwritten constitution is an inherently difficult exercise. Were theUnited Kingdom to have a written constitution, all of the rules now containedwithin various sources would be contained within it. By this means, a clearpicture would be obtained as to those rules which the framers of theconstitution regarded as being of ‘constitutional importance’. In the absence ofsuch a document, matters are less clear-cut and doubt exists as to preciselywhich rules – statutory, common law or conventional – are correctly definedas ‘constitutional’ rules. As Geoffrey Marshall explains:
[N]o easy logical limit can be set to the labour of the constitutional lawyers ...
any branch of the law, whether it deals prima facie with finance or crime or local
government, may throw up constitutional questions. [1971, p 6]
The disadvantage of such a lack of precision may be illustrated in relation to
the legal protection of civil liberties and human rights before the HumanRights Act 1998. Hitherto, in the United Kingdom, having neither adomestically enforceable Bill of Rights nor a written constitution, doubts as tosuch sensitive matters had been resolvable under an application under theEuropean Convention on Human Rights
1and, in some instances, by the Court
of Justice of the European Community. However, because the EuropeanConvention was not enacted into English law until the Human Rights Act1998, no domestic court could provide a remedy for alleged abuses of rightsprotected under the European Convention unless statute, common law orrights under European Community law provided a remedy. As a result, anindividual citizen seeking to discover precisely what legal rights he or she had
17SOURCES OF THE CONSTITUTION
1 See Chapter 22.

was obliged to scrutinise the statute book, the text of the European
Convention on Human Rights, and the treaties and case law relating toEuropean Community law. The Human Rights Act 1998 remedied thisdeficiency by conferring jurisdiction on domestic courts of law to rule onConvention rights.
It is even more difficult, in the absence of a written constitution, for the
citizen to discern, at a conceptual level, precisely what is and what is not a‘constitutional issue’. As Marshall observes, all legal issues in the UnitedKingdom are potentially capable of being interpreted as constitutional issues.That fact is not, however, reassuring to the student of the constitution who istrying to define its scope and limits.
To illustrate this definitional difficulty, questions as to the status of many
and differing statutes may be briefly examined. 
Employment law
Statutes regulating relations between workers and employers define theextent to which an employee is free to withdraw his or her labour, to act insupport of a dispute between him or herself and his or her employer, and toact in support of other workers in support of a dispute with employers. Suchmatters raise the fundamental question of the individual’s right to withdrawhis or her labour and the conditions under which this is lawful. Are suchstatutes ‘constitutional’ in nature?
Pornography
Also by way of illustration, in the United Kingdom, the Obscene PublicationsAct 1959 (as amended), an ordinary Act of Parliament having no particular‘constitutional status’, provides the legal rules relating to pornographicliterature. In contrast, in the United States of America, legal challenges to theavailability of and access to allegedly pornographic material fall under theFirst Amendment to the Constitution.
2The subject of pornography in the
United States may accordingly be classified as a clearly constitutional issue,being regarded as a question of freedom of ‘speech’.
Abortion
In the United Kingdom, the right to abortion is defined under the AbortionAct 1967 (as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990).In the United States of America, by contrast, the right to abortion falls underthe constitutional right to privacy provisions of the constitution. Theconstitution of the Republic of Ireland prohibits abortion under its right to lifeprovisions, and a recent challenge to that prohibition was launched under theChapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
182Roth v US (1957).

Sources of the Constitution
guise of restrictions on equal access to information and the right to free
movement to receive services under the law of the European Community.3
These examples are not intended to lead to an analysis of the substantive
legal and constitutional issues, but rather to demonstrate a very real andimportant point of principle. That point is that under a written constitution, aparticular issue may be defined as a ‘constitutional’ issue. Under an unwrittenconstitution, matters are far less certain. Pornography and abortion are clearlyregarded as constitutional matters in some jurisdictions.
There are obvious limitations to the utility of merely listing statutory and
common law sources of the constitution. It is, however, important at an earlystage of study to be familiar with the major statutory sources of theconstitution.
LEGAL SOURCES
The Magna Carta
One starting point is the Magna Carta of 1215.4Historically, the Magna Carta
represented a formal settlement between the Crown and the barons. TheCharter represented settlement of the grievances of citizens and challengedthe untrammelled powers of the King. The settlement provided for freedom ofthe Church, and the right of merchants to be free from exorbitant taxation.Today, the document’s importance lies in its declaration of the confirmation ofthe liberties enjoyed by ‘freemen of the realm’ and their future protection, andin the protection to be given to the enjoyment of these liberties by therequirement for trial by jury:
No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or
liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wisedestroyed; nor will we pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawfuljudgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. We will sell to no man, we willnot deny or defer to any man either justice or right. [Holt, 1965, Chapter XXIX]
While of little legal importance today – for much of the original Magna Carta
has been repealed – the document has symbolic value as an early assertion ofthe limits of monarchical power and the rights of individuals.
The Petition of Right 1628
The Petition of Right 1628 arose as a result of Darnel’s Case (the Five Knights’
Case ) (1627), where the defendants had been convicted and imprisoned for
refusing to pay a loan imposed by King Charles I. The Petition forbade suchloans, taxes and other monetary demands without the consent of parliament.The Petition, while still in force, was superseded by the Bill of Rights 1689.

4 Magna Carta, Statute 25 Edw I (1297). See Holt, 1965.

The Bill of Rights 1689
The background
The Bill of Rights 1689 is of greater contemporary constitutional importance
than the Magna Carta and the Petition of Right. The source of the Bill ofRights lies, in large measure, in the tensions between Roman Catholicism andthe state, originating with the conflict between the Holy See of Rome andHenry VIII (1491–1547). The Succession Act, Act of Supremacy and theTreason Act 1534 had established the supremacy of the King as head of theChurch of England and destroyed formal papal authority in England.Catholicism did not die out, but over the next 150 years, suspicion and fear of‘popery’ remained high at a public level. The death of Charles II in 1685heralded the succession of James II, an avowed Roman Catholic, whonevertheless publicly declared himself bound ‘to preserve this governmentboth in Church and state as it is now by law established’.
5Despite such
assurances, in subsequent years James II strove to remove discriminationagainst Catholics and to place Catholics in prominent public administrativeoffices at both central and local level. Prominent Anglicans, dismayed byJames’s promotion of Catholicism, entered into negotiations with William ofOrange, the Protestant husband of James’s daughter Mary, with a view totheir seizing the throne. In the absence of a male heir, Mary was next in line tothe English Crown. However, in 1688, James’s wife gave birth to a son, thusproviding a Catholic heir. In July of that year, James dissolved parliament.William of Orange landed in England with his army on 5 November 1688 andJames II fled the country, landing in France in December 1688.
The ‘Convention’ parliament
William summoned an assembly of peers, previous Members of Parliamentand aldermen of London. William, not yet king, had no legal power tosummon the assembly, and the assembly itself had no legal powers. Theassembly advised Prince William to summon a Convention of peers andcommoners. The Convention, meeting in January 1689, declared that James IIhad subverted the constitution and abdicated and that, accordingly, thethrone was ‘vacant’. The House of Lords subsequently agreed with theConvention, and on 13 February 1689, the Crown was offered to William andMary. The Convention then proceeded to declare itself to be the parliament ofEngland. The parliament had no authority to issue such a declaration: the onlylawful manner in which a parliament can come into being is by Writ ofSummons from the Crown, and it is for this reason that the Conventionparliament is widely regarded as having no law making powers:Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
205 Quoted in Lockyer, 1985, p 351.

Sources of the Constitution
... it is difficult for a lawyer to regard the Convention Parliament as a lawfully
constituted assembly. By whom was it summoned? Not by a king of England,but by a Prince of Orange. Even if we go back three centuries, we find noprecedent ... If, when the Convention met, it was no Parliament, its own actcould not turn it into a Parliament. The act which declares it to be a Parliamentdepends for its validity on the assent of William and Mary. The validity of thatassent depends on their being king and queen; but how do they come to beking and queen? Indeed, this statute very forcibly brings out the difficulty – anincurable defect. [Maitland, 1908, pp 284–85]
Nevertheless, the Convention parliament passed the Bill of Rights, which
incorporated the Declaration of Right which set out the terms under which theCrown was offered to William and Mary. The Convention parliamentcontinued in being until 1690 when a new parliament, correctly summoned bythe Crown, met.
William and Mary’s accession was not to be unconditional.
6The
Declaration of Right sought to resolve the actual and potential tensionsbetween Crown and parliament, Church and state. The terms of the Bill ofRights marked a sharp alteration in the balance of power between Crown andparliament – in parliament’s favour.
7
The substance of the Bill of Rights
The principal provisions of contemporary importance are:
Article I the pretended power of suspending ... or executing laws by
the Crown without parliamentary consent is illegal;
Article IV the levying of money for use of the Crown under the
prerogative without parliamentary consent is illegal;
Article VI the raising or keeping of an army in peacetime withoutparliamentary consent is illegal;
Article VIII elections of Members of Parliament ought to be free;
Article IX freedom of speech and debates in proceedings in parliament
ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or
place out of parliament;
Article X excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted;
Article XI jury trial is available; and
Article XIII for the redr ess of grievances, parliament ought to meet
frequently.
Subsequent to the Bill of Rights – and to give effect to its provisions – the
Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689 gave statutory force to the Bill ofRights, and the Meeting of Parliament Act 1694 provided that parliamentmust be summoned to meet at least once in three years.
216 As had been that of Charles II in 1660.
7 In Scotland, the Claim of Right 1689.

The Act of Settlement 1700
The Act of Settlement 1700 clarified the line of succession to the throne. The
Act also provided for security of tenure for the judiciary ‘during goodbehaviour’,
8thus ending the power of the Crown to dismiss judges at will. In
relation to succession to the throne, the Act tied the succession to Protestantheirs, thus prohibiting accession to the throne by persons who are RomanCatholics, or who marry a Roman Catholic.
The Treaty of Union 1706
The Treaty of Union also has enduring constitutional effect. The Treaty unitedEngland and Scotland under a single parliament of Great Britain. Prior to theTreaty, each country enjoyed independent sovereign status. Scotland had itsown parliament and its own system of private law. Decades earlier, James VI,King of Scotland and subsequently King of England (as James I (1603–25)),had attempted but failed to bring about a union between Scotland andEngland. By the late seventeenth century, negotiations were continuing with aview to ending the historical conflicts between the two countries,
9and the
Treaty of Union represented the culmination of this process. See, further,Chapter 7.
The major provisions of the Treaty of Union 1706
For current purposes, the most important provisions are as follows:
Article I that the two kingdoms of England and Scotland shall be
united in one kingdom by the name of Great Britain;
Article II that succession to the united throne be according to the Act of
Settlement 1700;
Article III that there be a single parliament;
Article XVIII that no alteration be made in laws which concern Scottish
private rights except for the evident utility of the subjects;and
Article XVIX that the Court of Session in Scotland remain ‘in all time being
as now constituted’, and that lower courts remain subject toalteration in their powers by parliament.
The European Communities Act 1972
The European Communities Act 1972, as amended, together with the Treatieson European Union 1992, 1997 and 2000, regulate the United Kingdom’smembership of the European Union and continue to have immensesignificance for the constitution of the United Kingdom (see Chapters 8 and 9Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law

and, further, below). The law of the European Union and Community
represents an increasingly significant source of constitutional law. By accedingto the European Community, and subsequently the Union, the UnitedKingdom has undertaken the obligation to accept the law of the Union. Tounderstand the constitutional implications of membership of the EuropeanUnion, it is necessary to understand the scope of the Treaties and the lawmaking institutions, and the manner in which laws are made and enter intoforce within the legal systems of the Member States. It is also necessary tounderstand clearly the relationship between European law and domestic lawand the question as to which law has supremacy should a conflict betweenthem arise. Under the traditional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, thelaw of the United Kingdom Parliament alone has sovereign power. Theperception of the European Court of Justice – the highest court of theEuropean Union – is much different. As will be seen, the European Court haslong asserted the supremacy of Community law
10over the laws of Member
States, thus providing a fertile source for constitutional speculation about theDiceyan theory of sovereignty. See Chapters 8 and 9.

The prerogative powers of the Crown are those powers which arise out of thecommon law and which are unique to the Crown. Two definitions may begiven by way of introduction. To Dicey, the prerogative powers were ‘theresidue of arbitrary and discretionary powers legally left in the hands of theCrown’ which, being exercised by the government in the name of the Crown,entails ‘every act which the executive government can do without theauthority of an Act of Parliament’ ((1898), 1959, p 425).
Blackstone, in his Commentaries, offers a more limited definition:
... that special pre-eminence which the King hath over and above all persons,
and out of the ordinary course of the common law ... And ... only applied tothose rights and capacities which the King enjoys in contradistinction to others.
The prerogative will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
Acts establishing devolution
The Acts establishing a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly and re-
establishing a Northern Ireland Assembly have decentralised the process ofgovernment and law-making, giving greater national autonomy to NorthernIreland, Scotland and Wales.
The Human Rights Act 1998
The Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates the rights enshrined in theEuropean Convention on Human Rights and Freedoms into domestic law
2310Costa v ENEL (1964).

represents a fundamental change in the domestic protection of rights. The
impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 has already been felt across wide areasof domestic law and provides citizens for the first time with a code of rightswhich are enforceable in the domestic courts rather than in the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Further illustrations
Further statutes of major constitutional importance – and the list is by nomeans exhaustive – include the following:
(a) the Statute of Westminster 1931 gave statutory force to the conventions
regulating relations between the sovereign United Kingdom Parliament
and legislatures of the Dominions;
(b) His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 varied the succession to
the throne established under the Act of Settlement 1700;
(c) the Regency Acts 1937–53 provided that if the Sovereign is under the age
of 18, regal powers shall be exercised through a Regent appointed underthe Acts; 
(d) the Royal Titles Act 1953, which founded a challenge from Scottish
lawyers to its compatibility with the Act of Union,
11provided that the
Sovereign may by Proclamation adopt such a style and titles as she maythink fit;
(e) the Treaty of Union with Ireland Act 1800, the Government of Ireland Act
1920, the Ireland Act 1949 and the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973have all reflected the changing constitutional relationship between Ireland,Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Throughout history, the judiciary has, through case law, defined therelationship between the institutions of the state – the Crown, the executive,parliament and the judiciary – and defined the relationship between the stateand the individual. As with statutory sources of the constitution, the entirestudy of constitutional and administrative law concerns the examination andanalysis of judicial precedents. The relationship between the judiciary andparliament is discussed in detail in Chapter 5, but note at this introductorystage the following points. With the rise in parliamentary supremacy in theseventeenth century, the role of the judges changed significantly, and it haslong been accepted that the dictum of Coke CJ in Dr Bonham’s Case , to the effect
that the judges could declare an Act of Parliament void, does not – if indeed itever did
12– represent the law. The judiciary today has no power to question
the validity of an Act of Parliament.13However, whilst Acts of Parliament areChapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law

unchallengeable as to their validity, delegated or secondary legislation is not
immune from such review. Furthermore, the judges have the power to reviewthe legality of acts of persons and organisations acting under powersconferred by Act of Parliament in order to ensure that they act intra vires the
powers conferred by parliament. Note also that, in relation to the conduct ofits business, parliament claims many privileges and immunities. As will beseen, judicial deference to parliament extends to the judges decliningjurisdiction over any matter of parliamentary privilege, other than to rulewhether or not a matter is in fact a matter of privilege. Article IX of the Bill ofRights 1689 confers the absolute privilege of freedom of speech inparliamentary proceedings. Accordingly, a Member of Parliament is free fromany threat from the law of defamation by any person harmed by his exerciseof free speech.
14
The extent to which judges have been able to protect individual rights
under the common law has – in the light of parliament’s supremacy – beenlimited. Traditionally, the United Kingdom had no Bill of Rights in so far assuch a document provides a written source of protection for certainfundamental rights and freedoms. In the absence of such guaranteedprotection – protection which would prevail even against an Act of Parliament– the citizen remained dependent either upon ad hoc statutory provisions –such as the Habeas Corpus Acts (1679, 1816, 1862), the Race Relations Act 1976or the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 – or upon judicial protection under thecommon law (see Chapters 19–22). By way of introductory illustration, thevery differing cases of Entick v Carrington (1765) and Liversidge v Anderson
(1942) may be cited. In the former case, the court ruled that a general warrantissued by a Home Secretary for the entry into private property and seizure ofallegedly seditious material was contrary to law and amounted to a trespassto property. This bold assertion of judicial power to rule on the legality of actsof the executive and to control such acts is in stark contrast to the ruling inLiversidge v Anderson . Here, in the context of a challenge to the legality of
detention without warrant under the order of the Home Secretary, the Houseof Lords held that the courts could not, in times of emergency, review theHome Secretary’s belief that detention was justified. Such conflictingoutcomes demonstrate that reliance on judicial protection from executiveaction, under common law, is by no means certain, let alone guaranteed. TheHuman Rights Act 1998, however, ‘incorporated’ the European Conventionon Human Rights into domestic law, and now enables citizens to challengethe legality of government action against the provisions of the Convention. Aswill be discussed in Chapter 22, the Act does not empower the courts to
2514 See Church of Scientology of California v Johnson-Smith (1972); Mummery, 1978; Leopold,
1981.

challenge the validity of Acts of Parliament, but rather preserves parliament’s
traditional sovereignty by empowering the courts to make declarations of theincompatibility of a statute with the Convention requirements. Thereafter, it isfor the government and parliament to change the law if it wishes to complywith the Convention requirements.
NON-LEGAL SOURCES OF THE CONSTITUTION
Constitutional conventions
The short explanation of the constitutional conventions is that they provide the
flesh which clothes the dry bones of the law; they make the legal constitutionwork; they keep it in touch with the growth of ideas.
15
Constitutional conventions form the most significant class of non-legal
constitutional rules.16A clear understanding of their nature, scope and
manner of application is essential to the study of the United Kingdom’sconstitution. Conventions supplement the legal rules of the constitution anddefine the practices of the constitution. Conventions, as Jennings states,‘provide the flesh which clothes the dry bones of the law’ and represent the‘unwritten maxims’ of the constitution. Conventions apply to virtually allaspects of the constitution, and for this reason it is, in part, unrealistic andunsatisfactory to attempt adequately to consider their role in a ‘vacuum’.Nevertheless, given their central importance, conventions must be consideredat this early stage, while bearing in mind that many and varied furtherillustrations will emerge throughout the course of study.
Conventions defined
Conventions are defined by AV Dicey as:
... conventions, understandings, habits or practices which, though they may
regulate the ... conduct of the several members of the sovereign power ... arenot in reality laws at all since they are not enforced by the courts. [(1898), 1959,p clii]
Marshall and Moodie offer an alternative definition:
... rules of constitutional behaviour which are considered to be binding by andupon those who operate the constitution but which are not enforced by the lawcourts ... nor by the presiding officers in the Houses of Parliament. [1971,pp 23–24]
A number of important questions arise concerning these non-legal rules,
namely:Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Before turning attention to the task of further analysis, some examples ofconstitutional conventions will aid understanding. Each of these conventionswill be discussed in greater detail later in this book. The number given at theend of each paragraph indicates which chapter should be referred to forfurther detail.
(a) Acts of Parliament are technically enacted by the Queen in Parliament –
the Crown, Commons and Lords. The Queen has the legal right to refuse
to give the royal assent to Bills passed by the House of Commons andLords. By convention, the Queen must assent to such Bills unless advisedto the contrary by her government (6);
(b) the Queen will appoint as Prime Minister the leader of the political party
with the majority of seats in the House of Commons (6);
(c) the Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons (6);

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but is sufficient to give a flavour ofthe nature and scope of constitutional conventions.
The binding nature of conventions
The characteristics of conventions are suggested both by Dicey and byMarshall and Moodie. The latter authors correctly introduce the concept of a‘rule’, and it is this concept which is central to our understanding and whichrequires further analysis. What is a rule? A rule may be defined as a statementprescribing the conduct which is required in a given situation and whichimposes an obligation on those who are regulated by the rule.
17The idea of
obligation is of prime importance here, for if a person is under an obligationwhich is recognised by observers of the constitution, and that person fails toact in accordance with the obligation, then that failure will give rise tolegitimate criticism which will invariably be phrased in terms of‘constitutionality’. To reiterate, the obligation imposes a standard of conductwhich is expected to be followed. The obligation is ‘normative’: by that ismeant that the rule is ‘prescriptive’ – that it dictates the appropriate form ofaction in a particular situation. As Sir Ivor Jennings states, conventions ‘notonly are followed but have to be followed’ (1959a, p 2).
Dicey’s definition suggests that conventions are of the same quality as
‘understandings, habits or practices’. This view is inaccurate in so far as noneof these words conveys the idea of obligation – the normative (or prescriptive)– the idea of what ought to be done in particular circumstances.
Conventions distinguished from habits
Conventions are conceptually different from ‘habits’ or ‘practices’ in that theseconcepts do not prescribe or dictate what ought to happen but are merelydescriptive of what in fact does happen. To offer a simple but possiblyoutdated example, consider the statement that ‘the English drink tea in theafternoon’. Drinking tea is a habit: the statement is simply reflective of actualobservable conduct. There is nothing in the statement which requires thatconduct, or which states that it ought to happen. Accordingly, it is adescriptive and not a normative statement. If the English fail to drink tea inthe afternoon, or drink coffee instead, that action is not going to give rise toany criticism because a mere habit imposes no obligation. The observation is astatement of what ‘is’, and not what ‘ought to be’. There is no obligationimposed on the English to drink tea and hence no criticism will follow fromfailure to do so. It is very different with a breach of a constitutionalChapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
2817 Hart, 1961, pp 79–88.

Sources of the Constitution
convention, which will invariably give rise to adverse criticism. Conventions
are thus distinguishable from habits.
Conventions distinguished from understandings
To what extent is Dicey correct in equating conventions with‘understandings’? Once more, it is helpful to resort to definitions. The word‘understanding’ connotes a mutual agreement between relevant actors as tothe pertinent subject matter, or the manner in which it is appropriate torespond or react to a given situation. As such, any understanding rests on ameeting of minds, and is capable of being the subject of misunderstanding, as
in cases where the actors, through a lack of understanding of the situation (oras a result of a differing interpretation of the situation), fail to be of ‘one mind’.An ‘understanding’ may well be relied on by the parties, as are conventions.Understandings may also be brought about by some form of previous, orprecedent, conduct or mutual recognition: but this is not a prerequisite fortheir existence or nature. Most importantly, an understanding, whileimposing some weak form of moral obligation will not, in the case of failure tocomply with its terms, give rise to a sanction in the form of criticism of thesame magnitude as that of a breach of a constitutional convention. Theexplanation for this lies in the fact that an understanding – as opposed to aconvention – does not amount to a rule, and accordingly is not obligation-imposing to the same degree as a convention.
Conventions distinguished from practices
The concept of a practice remains for consideration. A practice may be definedas being ‘a usual or customary action or proceeding’.
18A practice, therefore, is
the normal manner in which a person or body will react to a factual situationon the basis of some precedent form of conduct. In everyday life – whether incommercial offices or in the professions of medicine or law – it is acommonplace assertion that ‘it is our practice to do ...’. That statementconveys the message that past experience of doing something in a particularway is the correct way of proceeding, and that – unless there are justifiablereasons for not so doing – the practice will be adhered to. A practice,therefore, may be distinguished from a mere habit on the basis that it importsa notion of reflectiveness, the idea of the ‘right’ way of reacting to a situation.How, then, is a practice distinguishable from a convention? The borderlinebetween the two is admittedly fine. It may be, however, that the correctdividing line is drawn on the basis of the concept of obligation and rule, andthat it is legitimate to argue that whilst a practice imposes some form of weakobligation – and requires some justification for departure from the practice –the practice is no more than an emergent or potential convention and has notyet acquired the binding characteristic of a rule.
2918Collins’ English Dictionary (Adams, 1991).

Conventions distinguished from laws
Conventions are distinguishable from laws in a number of important respects.
First, the source of a legal rule is, for the most part, identifiable and certain. Insearching for a legal rule, its source will normally be found within a judicialdecision or within an Act of Parliament. Conventions are far less certain intheir origins, and it may at times be difficult to see whether a particular formof conduct is, for example, one of practice or convention. Secondly, the corecontent of a legal rule will generally have a settled meaning. One often-citedexample illustrates the point. In Chapter VII of The Concept of Law, Professor
HLA Hart offers the example of the correct interpretation of the word ‘vehicle’in a statute or delegated legislation (for example, in local authority bylaws). Ajudge, interpreting the word within the context of a trial concerning an allegedviolation of a bylaw prohibiting the use of vehicles in a public park, will beclear, for example, that a motor car, van or armoured truck will fall within themeaning of the word ‘vehicle’. But what of a skateboard or its successor,rollerblades? A skateboard shares some of the characteristics of the otherexamples given: a skateboard is a wheeled object and capable of conveying aperson from point A to point B. Is it then a ‘vehicle’? Professor Hart makestwo important points here. The first point is that to make sense of the word‘vehicle’, the word must be placed within its broader context. That is to say,the question must be asked: ‘For what purpose was the rule devised?’ In otherwords, can the judge provide an interpretation which is meaningful withinthe context of the legislature’s intention?
The second point, of greater significance to this discussion, is that most
words – legal or non-legal – have a ‘core of certainty and penumbra of doubt’,and that while a motorised wheeled object designed for the carriage ofpersons and goods is clearly a vehicle, an object designed for purelyrecreational purposes may, or may not, subject to the court’s interpretation ofthe purpose of the legislation, fall within the meaning of a particular word.
The foregoing discussion can be presented – albeit with recognition of
overlaps between, and ambiguities in, the concepts – in the following tabularform:

Summary of the meaning of constitutional conventions
A constitutional convention is a non-legal rule which imposes an obligation
on those bound by the convention, breach or violation of which will give riseto legitimate criticism; and that criticism will generally take the form of anaccusation of ‘unconstitutional conduct’.
The source of conventions
The question concerning the source of the constitutional convention is in partinterwoven with the characteristics of the convention. A conventional rulemay be said to exist when a traditional practice has been consciously adoptedand recognised by those who operate the constitution as the correct manner inwhich to act in a given circumstance. A practice will be seen to have become aconvention at the point at which failure to act in accordance with it gives riseto legitimate criticism.
Sir Ivor Jennings once suggested that three questions must be asked in
order to determine whether a convention exists. First, are there any precedentsfor the convention? ‘Mere practice,’ he tells us, ‘is not enough. The fact that anauthority has always behaved in a certain way is no warrant for saying that itought to behave in that way.’ What more, then, is required? According toJennings, that turns on the normativity of the practice: 
... if the authority itself and those connected with it believe that they ought to
do so [behave in a certain way], then the convention does exist ... Practice aloneis not enough. It must be normative. [1959a, p 135]
Finally, Jennings argues that neither practice nor precedent is sufficient. In
addition, there must be a reason for the rule: ‘... the creation of a conventionmust be due to the reason of the thing because it accords with the prevailingpolitical philosophy.’ This point is supported by JP Mackintosh. AcceptingViscount Esher’s view that ‘precedent, like analogy, is rarely conclusive’ (1915,p 167), Mackintosh argues that precedents have ‘no independent existence orvalidity’. Rather, the precedent represents ‘a correct decision or action incertain political circumstances’. Accordingly:
... searching for a precedent is really looking for a case where previous
exponents of the constitution have solved a similar difficulty in an approvedfashion. [Mackintosh, 1977, p 13]
Situations will arise for which there is no apparent precedent and where
accordingly there is no firm convention regulating a situation. Mackintoshillustrates this phenomenon by reference to the dilemma in which George Vfound himself in 1923 when the general election failed to produce a clearmajority for any one party, and thus left the King with a real choice as to whoshould be appointed Prime Minister:
31

... the King noted that ‘there are really no precedents for the present situation. I
must use my own judgment as each case arises’. [1977, p 13]
Whether the outcome is deemed to be correct or not will depend on the
acceptability of that action in light of current political practice.
With this brief discussion in mind, it can be said that, while the meaning
and scope of conventions frequently display a lack of certainty, it does notnecessarily follow that this is a conclusively distinguishing characteristic fromrules of law which may also display uncertainty as to their meaning.Nonetheless, it must be conceded that the requirements of some conventionalrules are often difficult to discern. Sir Ivor Jennings cites Mr Stanley Baldwin,Prime Minister during the periods 1912–24, 1924–29 and 1935–37:
The historian can tell you probably perfectly clearly what the constitutional
practice was at any given period in the past, but it would be very difficult for aliving writer to tell you at any given period in his lifetime what the constitutionof the country is in all respects, and for this reason, that almost at any givenmoment ... there maybe one practice called ‘constitutional’ which is falling intodesuetude and there may be another practice which is creeping into use but isnot yet constitutional. [1959a, p 12]
Who is bound by constitutional conventions?
The question as to who is bound by the rules, for the most part, gives rise to
little practical difficulty. For example, it is a convention that the doctrine ofcollective responsibility of ministers to parliament be observed. Theconvention requires that all members of Cabinet, the inner core ofgovernment, must speak in public with a united voice, and further, in order toreinforce public confidence in government, Cabinet members may notdisclose the contents of Cabinet discussions. This issue will be discussed indetail subsequently in Chapter 11; for current illustrative purposes, it issufficient to indicate the doubts which have been voiced as to the scope of thisconvention. Members of Cabinet are appointed predominantly from theelected House of Commons, but may also be appointed from the House ofLords. In this manner, members of Cabinet are made accountable toparliament, and through parliament to the electorate. Does the convention, forinstance, require that not only members of Cabinet – the Prime Minister and16 to 20 senior ministers – but also junior ministers
19and their Parliamentary
Private Secretaries20follow the decisions taken in Cabinet and refrain from
speaking against them? That would appear to be the consensus view, but nodefinitive rule exists. For the most part, however, it is clear that theconventional rules are understood by those actors on the constitutional stage.
For collective Cabinet responsibility to be a reality, it is essential that there
be full and frank discussion between its members and – in order thatChapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
3219 Ministers who are not in Cabinet.
20 Elected Members of Parliament on the most junior rung of the ministerial ladder.

Sources of the Constitution
consensus appears to exist – that decisions are collectively reached. The
doctrine was put under much strain during Mrs Thatcher’s government(1979–89). Professor Peter Hennessy has observed that:
Mrs Thatcher moved into Downing Street and subjected the conventions of
Cabinet government to their greatest hammering since David Lloyd Georgerefashioned the Cabinet system at the height of the First World War. [1986b,p viii]
During Mrs Thatcher’s premiership, two practices emerged.21The first was
that increasing use was made of decision making by a small group of Cabinet
members, an ‘inner Cabinet’, whose decisions were then, under theconvention of collective responsibility, made binding of all other members,even though they had not participated in the decision making process. Thesecond practice was that the Prime Minister took advice on financial andeconomic policy from an economist who was neither a member of Cabinet noreven a Member of Parliament. Accordingly, a non-elected and democraticallyunaccountable individual was involved in decision making with the PrimeMinister, whose decision – provided that she could secure the support ofCabinet – would bind all ministers and others outside the Cabinet but holdinggovernment office.
22One effect of this practice was to reduce the power and
influence of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Theconstitutional convention of collective responsibility is silent as to a situationsuch as this, and doubts were expressed as to the propriety of the PrimeMinister’s conduct.
23
The effects of breaching constitutional conventions
The question of consequences that flow from a breach of a conventional ruleconstitutes both a simple and a complex issue. If – as a starting point fordiscussion – the consequence of breaking a rule of law is examined, two basicpoints must be recognised. The first point is that a breach of law normally, butnot invariably, leads to enforcement of the rule by the courts. The secondpoint is that when a rule of law is breached, the rule remains valid and inforce, unless repealed by parliament or overruled by the judges. Withconventional rules, the situation is very different. Being non-legal rules, thereis no question of a breach of convention being enforced by the courts: thecourts do not have the jurisdiction to enforce conventional rules, althoughthey may give recognition to them.
24However, it is also the case, as Dicey
argued, that breach of a convention may lead to a breach of law. The mostoften cited example offered is that if parliament, in breach of convention, didnot meet annually, the consequence would be that money granted on an

had previous Prime Ministers.
22 Non-Cabinet ministers, junior ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries.
23 Partly in consequence of the Prime Minister’s style of government, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer resigned: see, further, Chapter 11.
24Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976); Manuel v Attorney General (1983).

annual basis by parliament for the maintenance of the armed forces would not
be forthcoming. Accordingly, maintenance of the army would becomeunlawful by virtue of Article VI of the Bill of Rights 1689, which provides thatthe raising and keeping of an army in peacetime, without parliament’sconsent, is unlawful. Such consequences are the exception. For the most part,the consequence of violating a conventional rule is political rather than legal.
That said, it is not possible to offer a single consequence. Much will turn
on the particular convention ‘broken’, the extent of the ‘breach’ and thepolitical mood of the country at the time. Conventions are obeyed because ofthe potential political difficulties which would arise if a firmly establishedconvention was departed from without constitutional justification.
Two introductory illustrations of the very differing effects of breaching
conventional rules are provided by the doctrine of collective ministerialresponsibility and the House of Lords.
25
Collective ministerial responsibility
The doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility provides an example of theuncertainties entailed in the scope and binding nature of conventional rules.In two situations the doctrine has been ‘waived’ in order to respondeffectively to political circumstances. In 1932, a coalition government was inoffice.
26Following Cabinet disagreements over economic policy, the
government adopted an ‘agreement to differ’, whereby members of Cabinetwere free to express their divergent views both in parliament and in public.Within months, the dissident members resigned from the Cabinet andcollective responsibility was reinstated. In 1975, the Labour government wasdivided as to the benefits of continued membership of the EuropeanCommunity. It was decided that the matter should be put to the electorate in areferendum. The Cabinet itself was deeply divided on the question and thePrime Minister decided to ‘lift’ the convention of collective responsibility inorder to facilitate full and free public debate. Thus, a convention was set asidefor a particular purpose, for a defined period of time and for a specific matter.The convention remained effective in respect of other matters before theCabinet, and upon resolution of the issue, the convention was fullyreinstated.
27No adverse political consequences flowed from this, despite
criticisms that such a move was unconstitutional. It is arguable whether thisaction represented a breach of convention at all, but it was clearly a departurefrom normal constitutional practice. Above all, these situations demonstratethe point that conventions can be adjusted, under certain circumstances whichare undefined, to suit the exigencies of a particular situation.Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
3425 Discussed more fully in Chapters 11 and 17, respectively.
26 See Marshall, 1984, Chapter 4; and see, further, Chapter 11.
27 The referendum produced a vote in favour of continued membership, although the
government had indicated that, in any event, it would not be bound by the result.

Sources of the Constitution
The House of Lords 1908–10
A very different consequence followed a breach of convention by the House of
Lords between 1908 and 1910.28Prior to the Parliament Act 1911, one major
conventional rule regulated the relationship between the House of Lords andthe House of Commons in legislative matters and most particularly infinancial matters: namely, that the Lords would ultimately give way to thewill of the elected House. This convention broke down in 1908 when theHouse of Lords rejected the Finance Bill of the Commons. After a deadlockbetween the two Houses, and a threat by the King to ‘flood’ the House ofLords with sufficient new peers to secure a majority for the Bill, thegovernment introduced the Parliament Bill 1911. The Parliament Act, whichwill be looked at in detail in Chapter 17, provided that the House of Lordswould no longer enjoy equal powers to approve or reject legislative proposalsand that its power would be restricted to a power to delay legislation subjectto strict time limits.
29It can be seen from this that where the breach of a
convention is deemed to be sufficiently grave, parliament can – in the exerciseof its sovereign power – place a convention on a statutory basis.
Further illustrations will present themselves throughout the course of this
book: conventional rules are of such fundamental importance that theyregulate virtually every aspect of constitutional law. The main point to beunderstood here is that breaches of conventions have no automatic or definedramifications.
The differing importance of individual conventions
A related factor which should also be understood is that not all conventionsare of equal certainty or importance, and it is in part for this reason that theconsequences of a breach will vary. For example, in legal terms, the right toassent or to refuse to assent to Bills passed by parliament rests with theCrown. However, by convention, the Crown must assent to Bills passed byparliament whenever so advised by the Prime Minister. So settled is theconvention that the Crown must assent to Bills passed by parliament that it isdifficult to foresee circumstances under which it would be broken.
30Perhaps
a political situation could present itself where a Bill had been duly passed byparliament and where the government had a change of heart and, despiteparliamentary opposition, refused to present the Bill for assent. Would thisrepresent a breach of convention? Arguably not, for the convention requiresthat the monarch give assent on the advice of her government. A situationsuch as this would undoubtedly cause a political furore; but it is doubtful thatit would represent unconstitutional conduct on the part of the government,and still less so by the Crown. It could also be asked, speculatively, what the
3528 See Jennings, 1969, Chapter 12.4.
29 Money Bills, one month; non-Money Bills, two years over three parliamentary sessions.
30 See Marshall, 1984, p 22.

position would be if a Bill was duly passed by parliament, the Bill was
presented for the royal assent and refused on the basis that public opinionwas so firmly set against the Bill that to assent would amount to defeating therights of the electorate. Such a situation raises some fundamental questionsabout democracy and the relationship between the electorate and the electedgovernment. Geoffrey Marshall questions whether the power to refuse assentto legislation is ‘now a dead letter’, and states that, ‘under presentconstitutional arrangements, it may well be so’ (1984, p 22), while recognisingthat the issue is not closed.
At the other end of the spectrum of the certainty of conventions and their
meaning, is the doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility.
31For further
discussion of this, see Chapter 11. In essence, individual ministerialresponsibility requires that ministers of the Crown are accountable toparliament, and through parliament to the electorate, for their personalconduct and for the conduct of their departments.
32The doctrine is expressed
in practical terms at Parliamentary Question Time, in debates, and incommittee proceedings, whereby parliament ensures that ministers explainand, if necessary, defend their actions.
33In theory, if a minister’s personal
conduct falls below the high standard required of public figures, he or sheshould resign. Equally, if the government department under a minister’sauthority is found to have misused or mismanaged its powers, it is theminister who takes the responsibility in parliament. If the matter is ofsufficient gravity and the minister loses the support of his party and PrimeMinister, he or she may be forced to resign. But, as with responsibility forpersonal conduct, there are no hard and fast rules. There exist no fixed criteriafrom which it can be predicted in advance the consequence which will flowfrom a breach of convention. In terms of consequences, this convention is themost uncertain of all conventional rules.
Evolution and change
Implicit in the above discussion lies the answer to a further question: how doconventions change? It has been seen that conventions come into being, unlikelegal rules, when a habit or practice becomes so established that it imposesobligations on those to whom it applies, and takes on the characteristics of arule. And so it is with changes in conventions. A convention may change withchanging circumstances: individual ministerial responsibility is a primeexample of this feature of conventions. Conventions may adapt to meetparticular needs, as with collective responsibility in relation to the EuropeanCommunity in 1975, discussed above. Conventions may be breached andplaced on a statutory basis, as with the House of Lords in 1911. A legal rulehas a relatively fixed and certain quality while in existence. If a legal rule isChapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Sources of the Constitution
changed, either by judicial decision or by parliament, the previous rule will be
superseded by the new: it will ‘go out with a bang’. The same cannot be saidof conventions. For the most part, they evolve, adapt in amoeba-like fashion tomeet the constitutional needs of the time. It is for this reason that they presentthe student of the constitution with such a fascinating challenge.
The courts and conventions
Given that conventional rules are non-legal rules, the attitude of the courtstowards constitutional conventions is inevitably different from their attitudeto legal rules. The courts do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate uponconventions. This is not to say that a court must take no cognisance ofconventional rules, but rather, as Dicey asserted, conventions are not ‘courtenforceable’. The courts will give recognition to conventions, although theyare rarely called upon to do so. Two cases are illustrative. The first is that ofAttorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976) .In 1976, the executors of the late
Richard Crossman, a former Cabinet minister, decided to proceed withpublication of the diaries he had kept while in government. The diariesincluded records of Cabinet discussions which, under the doctrine ofcollective ministerial responsibility, may never be revealed other than underthe conditions specified by law or on the authority of the Cabinet Secretary.The government sought an injunction to restrain publication on the basis thatCabinet meetings are, by convention, confidential and that the diaries,accordingly, represented a breach of confidentiality.
This litigation required that the court recognise the convention, and it did
so. However, having no jurisdiction over conventional rules, the court couldnot enforce the convention. The court ruled in favour of the government inrelation to the doctrine of confidentiality. In the event, however, the courtdeclined to suppress ‘secrets’ which were over ten years old. The court ruledthat, unless national security was involved (see Chapter 23), an eight to tenyear embargo was the maximum period that such material would beprotected.
Lord Widgery CJ recited the opposing arguments:
The Attorney General contends that all Cabinet papers and discussions are
prima facie confidential, and that the court should restrain any disclosure
thereof if the public interest in concealment outweighs the public interest in aright to free publication. The Attorney General further contends that, if it isshown that the public interest is involved, he has the right and duty to bringthe matter before the court.
The defendants’ main contention is that, whatever the limits of the convention
of joint Cabinet responsibility may be, there is no obligation enforceable at lawto prevent the publication of Cabinet papers and proceedings, except inextreme cases where national security is involved. In other words, thedefendants submit that the confidential character of Cabinet papers anddiscussion is based on a true convention as defined in the evidence ofProfessor Wade, namely, an obligation founded in conscience only.
37

Accordingly, the defendants contend that publication of these diaries is not
capable of control by any order of this court.
In reaching judgment, the Lord Chief Justice evaluated the doctrine of
collective responsibility, finding that there was ‘overwhelming evidence thatthe doctrine ... is generally understood and practised and equally strongevidence that it is on occasion ignored’.
34He recognised also that the Attorney
General’s submissions as to the duty of confidence owed by ministers to theCrown were correct. Notwithstanding that acceptance, the Lord Chief Justiceopined that there was no one dominant rule to be applied to the situation.Three factors had to be weighed in the balance, and in order to succeed, theAttorney General had to establish three matters:
(a) that such publication would be a breach of confidence;
(b) that the public interest requires that the publication be restrained; and
(c) that there are no other facts of the public interest contradictory of and more
compelling than that relied upon.
Moreover, the court, when asked to restrain such a publication, must closely
examine the extent to which relief is necessary to ensure that restrictions arenot imposed beyond the strict requirement of public need. [p 755]
The injunction was refused.
In 1982, in the Canadian case of Reference re Amendment of the Constitution of
Canada (1982) ,detailed consideration was given to the relationship between
law and convention. The principal question for decision by the Supreme
Court of Canada was whether, as a matter of law, the constitution of Canadacould be amended without the consent of the Provinces. A second questionwas whether the consent of the Provinces was required as a matter ofconvention. The British North America Act 1867 created the Dominion ofCanada and set out the legislative and executive powers of the provincial andfederal legislatures. Amendment to the 1867 Act was possible only by afurther Act of the Westminster Parliament. At that time, the Statute ofWestminster 1931
35provided, inter alia, that the United Kingdom Parliament
would not legislate for a Dominion ‘unless it is declared in that Act that thatDominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof’ (section 4).Section 7 of the Statute, however, prohibited changes to the British NorthAmerica Act 1867, which affected the competence of provincial or federallegislatures. In 1949, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the British NorthAmerica (No 2) Act, which gave substantial powers of amendment to the 1867Act to the Canadian Federal Parliament. However, the power conferred wasnot absolute, and the Canadian Parliament lacked the competence to enactamendments altering the distribution of powers between the respectivelegislatures without the request and consent of the provincial legislatures. Oneof the principles intended to regulate amendments to the constitution, agreedby all the Provinces and set out in a Canadian White Paper in 1965, stated that:Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
3834Attorney General v Jonathan Cape (1976), p 756.
35 See, further, Chapter 7.

Sources of the Constitution
... the Canadian Parliament will not request an amendment directly affecting
federal-provincial relationships without prior consultation and agreement withthe Provinces. This principle did not emerge as early as others but came in1907, and particularly since 1930, has gained increasing recognition andacceptance. The nature and the degree of provincial participation in theamending process, however, have not lent themselves to easy definition.
It was argued by the Provinces that the ‘request and consent’ declaration
required under the Statute of Westminster meant the ‘request and consent’ ofboth the Dominion and the Provinces if the Act were one affecting provincialor federal competence.
By a majority, the Canadian Supreme Court – adopting Jennings’s test for
the existence of a convention – recognised the constitutional convention thatthe Canadian Parliament would not request the Queen to lay before theUnited Kingdom Parliament an Act to amend the constitution of Canada in amanner affecting federal-provincial relationships and their respective powersand rights without first obtaining the agreement of the Provinces.Nevertheless, the court went on to hold that the Diceyan distinction betweenconvention and law remained and that the court could not accordingly gobeyond recognition of the convention and enforce it. By a majority, theSupreme Court ruled that consent of the Provinces was not required by lawand, again by a majority, that consent was required by convention, but thatthe convention could not be enforced by a court of law. The court declaredthat:
The main purpose of constitutional conventions is to ensure that the legal
framework of the constitution will be operated in accordance with theprevailing constitutional values or principles of the period.
Being based on custom and precedent, constitutional conventions are usually
unwritten rules ...
The conventional rules of the constitution present one striking peculiarity. In
contradistinction to the laws of the constitution, they are not enforced by thecourts. One reason for this situation is that, unlike common law rules,conventions are not judge-made rules. They are not based on judicialprecedents but on precedents established by the institutions of governmentthemselves. Nor are they in the nature of statutory commands which it is thefunction and duty of the courts to obey and enforce. Furthermore, to enforcethem would mean to administer some formal sanction when they arebreached. But, the legal system from which they are distinct does notcontemplate formal sanctions for their breach.
It should be borne in mind, however, that, while they are not laws, some
conventions may be more important than some laws. Their importancedepends on that of the value or principle which they are meant to safeguard.Also, they form an integral part of the constitution of the constitutional system.
... constitutional conventions plus constitutional law equal the total
constitution of the country.
39

Is the distinction between law and convention important?
Both Sir Ivor Jennings and John Mackintosh have suggested that the
distinction between conventions and laws is ultimately of little significance. InThe Law and the Constitution, Jennings asserts that:
... there is no distinction of substance or nature. The conventions are like most
fundamental rules of any constitution in that they rest essentially upon generalacquiescence. [1959b, p 117]
In The British Cabinet, John Mackintosh argues that:
There is a distinction between law and convention both from the view of thepractical politician and the student of government, but in the long termdevelopment of the constitution, it is of no great importance. Both rest on thenecessities of political life. Laws can be repealed or conventions changed if thisis found to be desirable. The real difference between law and convention is justthat there is no formal procedure for enacting or enforcing conventions,though some conventions (for example, the monarch shall not veto lawspassed by both Houses; the Prime Minister shall resign if he is defeated on amajor issue in the Commons) are as important as any laws and perhaps evenmore difficult to alter. [1977, p 12]
Such views, while having merit from a political perspective, are overly
dismissive from a legal, constitutional standpoint. The significant differencebetween laws and conventions is well demonstrated in both Attorney General v
Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976) and Reference re Amendment of the Constitution of
Canada (1982).
36In both cases, the lack of a legal remedy is explained by the
strict distinction between law and convention, and by the courts’ refusal to gobeyond recognition of the convention to enforcement thereof.
37 Indeed, in the
latter case,judicial approval was given to Professor Colin Munro’s view that:
The validity of conventions cannot be the subject of proceedings in a court of
law. Reparation for breach of such rules will not be effected by any legalsanction. There are no cases which contradict these propositions. In fact, theidea of a court enforcing a mere convention is so strange that the questionhardly arises.
If, in fact, laws and conventions are different in kind, as is my argument, then
an accurate and meaningful picture of the constitution may only be obtained ifthis distinction is made. If the distinction is blurred, analysis of the constitutionis less complete; this is not only dangerous for the lawyer, but less than helpfulto the political scientist. [1975, p 228]
Should conventions be codified?
One question asked earlier was whether or not constitutional conventions
should be codified. Again, no straightforward or simple answer to thisquestion presents itself. Much will turn on the perception of the value of thestatus quo. Much also turns on the constitutional implications of attempting toprovide a comprehensive, binding code of constitutional conventions.Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
4036 See, also, First Report of the Foreign Affairs Committee, HC 42 (1980–81), London: HMSO.
37 For a strong, if controversial, argument against this orthodox position, see Allan, 1986.

Sources of the Constitution
The Australian experiment
In Australia, a constitutional crisis in 1975 contributed to the experiment in
codification of conventions into an authoritative but non-legally binding text.The crisis involved the prerogative power of the Crown in the person of theGovernor General to dismiss the Prime Minister and appoint a caretakerPrime Minister on the condition of ensuring the passage of financiallegislation and the holding of a general election. One outcome of the crisis – inwhich the inherent vagueness of the conventional rules was revealed – wasformal consideration of the ‘codification’ of conventions, albeit in a non-legalform. During the crisis, conventions had been ‘creatively interpreted andignored in a successful attempt to unseat the Labour government during thedepths of an international recession’.
38In 1983, a plenary session of the
Constitutional Convention adopted a set of 34 practices which were to be‘recognised and declared’ as conventions of the Australian constitution.Among those ‘recognised’ were the powers of the Crown in relation to theGovernor General, and his powers in relation to the dismissal of ministers andpowers over parliament, and the relationship between the Prime Minister andthe Governor General in relation to the dissolution of parliament.
39
Professor Charles Sampford has analysed comprehensively the merits and
demerits of the codification of conventions. Among the many unansweredquestions raised are the following. Under what authority did theConstitutional Convention act? What is the effect of the resolution? Is itmerely declaratory of the existing rules? If there is a conflict with therestatement and actual practice, which should be authoritative? ProfessorSampford contends that there exist three possibilities here. If the code isfollowed in preference to conventional practice, then the codification goesbeyond clarification and becomes a source of the rules themselves. This raisesthe question ‘why should the old rules and old sources give way to the new?’.The second approach is that the ‘declaration’ has whatever force theconstitutional actors accord to it: it would be absurd if the declaration were tohave no authority. Thirdly, it could be argued that the declaration is merelyevidence of the rule. This latter possibility, however, is unsatisfactory in so faras the declaration was intended to be ‘sole and conclusive evidence for theexistence of the recognised convention. This effectively makes theConstitutional Convention a new source for conventions’. Furthermore, whatis the position where a convention was agreed to only by a small majority?What then happens to its authority? To what extent will the new conventionsbe observed? What is the status of those pre-existing conventions which werenot ‘recognised and declared’? As can be seen, codification is – even ifdesirable – by no means a simple matter.

regulating the powers of the Queen and the Governor General.

Conclusion
It is clear from the analysis thus far that conventions comprise a set of binding
rules, non-legal in nature, which supplement and inform the legal rules of theconstitution and which can adapt to meet changing circumstances. Viewed inthat light, their primary importance lies in their flexibility. On the other hand,it may be argued cogently that for rules of such importance to be ill-defined,uncertain in application and unenforceable by the courts is, at best,anomalous, and at worst, a threat to the principle of government according tolaw. 
Further considerations intrude upon the discussion. It has been seen that
conventions are flexible. In this feature lies much of their value, and it is to bedoubted whether, in relation to such a dynamic organism as the constitution,it would be possible to identify, define and formalise conventions in such amanner both to provide a comprehensive code and to allow for subsequentconstitutional development. It may prove to be the case that codificationwould stultify the growth of the constitution. On the other hand, suchcodification would undoubtedly provide greater insight into the rulesregulating government and thereby act as some check on the power ofgovernment. Professor SA de Smith
40states that codification of conventions
would purchase certainty at the expense of flexibility, and this point mustcarry great weight in evaluating the desirability of codification.
The relationship between the government and the courts must also be
weighed in the balance in this regard. It has been seen that the courts giverecognition to, but cannot enforce, conventions. If the effect of codificationwere to give jurisdiction to the courts, this would represent a very real andproblematic shift in the balance of authority and power between thegovernment and the courts. In Chapter 5, the doctrine of the separation ofpowers is considered in detail. Sufficient has been said by way of introductionfor it to be apparent that if the courts were to be given jurisdiction toadjudicate upon and enforce, by way of legal sanction, the conventional rulesof the constitution, this would impinge greatly upon the concept of theseparation of powers.
For these reasons, the loss of flexibility and the separation of powers
doctrine, it can be argued that conventions should not be codified.
Authoritative works
Finally and in brief, mention should be made of the writings of eminent juristssuch as Blackstone, Dicey, Jennings and later commentators to whose worksthe actors on the constitutional stage, including the judges, may makereference for elucidation of matters of constitutional law.Chapter 2: Constitutional and Administrative Law
4240 de Smith and Brazier, 1998, Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 3
The United Kingdom comprises England, Wales, Scotland (which together
comprise Great Britain) and Northern Ireland.1The Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, while not forming part of the United Kingdom other than for thepurposes of nationality law,
2are represented by the United Kingdom
government in international affairs.
While it is correct to speak of the constitution of the United Kingdom, it
should not be assumed that there is a single legal system within theconstitutionally defined area. The English legal system extends to Englandand Wales. Scotland has its own system of private law which is distinct fromEnglish law. Equally, in Northern Ireland, there exists a quite distinct legalsystem. Nevertheless, it is the Westminster Parliament which has hithertolegislated for each jurisdiction, and been supreme or ‘sovereign’. Changecame about in 1998, with devolution of law making powers to a ScottishParliament, a Northern Ireland Assembly and administrative powers to aWelsh Assembly. Each enjoys limited legislative powers, which must beconsidered alongside the legislative powers which remain with Westminster.The United Kingdom will remain in being: the object of devolution is toprovide more representative and accountable regional government, and tostrengthen rather than undermine the union with England.

To understand the constitutional arrangements, it is necessary to revert to
history, for the contemporary structure of the United Kingdom is the productof forces of the past. While the ‘kingdom’ is now ‘united’, it has not alwaysbeen so. Rather, the United Kingdom has been forged in part out of conquest(in the case of Wales and what is now the Republic of Ireland) and out ofTreaty (for example, with Scotland in 1706). As will be seen, in relation to eachpart of the United Kingdom, the union with England has not always beensmooth, and the history of the United Kingdom is one marked by conflict,with demands at different times in history from Ireland, Scotland and Walesfor self-governing status. Devolution – the granting of self-regulatinglegislative powers – as mentioned above, has become a reality for Scotlandand Northern Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Wales.

NORTHERN IRELAND4
Northern Ireland has a land area of some 5,000 square miles and a population
amounting to three per cent of the United Kingdom population. Theconstitutional position of Northern Ireland cannot be understood withoutsome appreciation of the history of Ireland as a whole – a matter whichremains of contemporary constitutional importance given the recentinitiatives to end the sectarian bloodshed and to achieve a lastingconstitutional settlement in relation to the status of Northern Ireland. Spacedoes not permit more than a brief overview of the rich and troubled history ofIreland. 
Ireland: the early history – an overview
Ireland first came under the control of the English in the twelfth centurywhen, in 1155, Henry II (1154–89) had been awarded the overlordship ofIreland by the English Pope, Adrian IV, for the specific purpose of reformingthe Irish Church. An Irish Parliament was established by the end of thethirteenth century, although representation was confined to English settlers,thereby excluding the native Irish population. At the time of Henry VII’s reign(1485–1509) English rule in Ireland was confined to the Pale, a stretch ofcoastal land running some 50 miles north of Dublin and 20 miles inland. Anearly attempt at a form of self-government entailed the Irish Parliament’sassertion that Acts of the English Parliament would extend to Ireland only inso far as the Irish Parliament ratified the statute. The outcome of this claim toindependence was the reassertion of royal power and the passage ofPoyning’s Law
5in 1494, which provided that all Irish legislative proposals
must be approved by the King and his Council.
When Henry VIII (1509–47) broke with Rome6and established himself as
Head of the Church of England, he ran the risk of incurring Irish RomanCatholic hostility. In 1534, rebellion broke out, the leaders of which called onthe Pope and the Spanish Emperor for support against the King of England.The result was military suppression of the rebellion by an invasion of anEnglish army under the leadership of Sir William Skeffington. Direct rule wasto be introduced with Skeffington appointed as the King’s Lord Deputy. In1540, with the fall from favour of Henry’s Chancellor, Cromwell, Henry VIIIdecided on conciliation with the Irish, and in 1541, the Irish Parliament finallyrecognised Henry as King of Ireland.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
The province of Ulster – then the nine northern counties of Ireland – was
largely unaffected by English rule until the sixteenth century, when
Elizabeth I (1558–1603) sought to extend her power beyond the Pale. On theadvice of the Privy Council, the Queen decided that government in Irelandshould be approximated as far as possible to that of England rather thanallowing governance on the basis of Ireland’s own history and experience. TheQueen’s decision was to alter the course of history. Beyond the Pale, the‘Irishry’ had enjoyed their own language, customs and law. English was nowto become the official language and English law and administrative practiceswere to extend to the whole territory of Ireland. In Munster, in the south, anearlier rebellion against English rule – supported by Spanish and Italiantroops and financed by the Pope – started in 1569, and was finally suppressedin 1583. 
Relations between the English and the Irish remained uneasy. Ireland
adhered to the Roman Catholic faith,
7whereas the immigrants from Scotland
and England were staunchly Protestant. The native tongue was Gaelic, alanguage neither understood nor spoken by the English. When Hugh O’Neill,the Earl of Tyrone, demanded that traditional rule by chieftains be allowedand that there should be official tolerance of Roman Catholicism, Elizabethrejected these demands. In consequence of this rejection, a Spanish armada setforth in support of Catholicism. The armada, whilst unsuccessful, heightenedthe sense of Irish nationalism and antagonism towards the English. In 1603,the rebellion was ultimately suppressed: Tyrone and others fled to France in‘the flight of the Earls’. The province was taken over by the Crown and, in1607, with the exile of the native aristocracy, was divided into counties on theEnglish model.
One effect of Irish suppression was to further English settlement of the
area, with land being confiscated and distributed to English and Scotsimmigrants. In 1609, under James I (1603–25), a comprehensive scheme of‘plantation’ began in Ulster, and by 1622, some 21,000 English, Scottish andWelsh immigrants had settled in Northern Ireland. Fortified towns were builtby the incoming settlers as ‘control points’ across the province. 
As the number of Protestant immigrants increased, so too did the potential
for religious strife. Immigrants to Ulster changed its character into that of aProtestant society, and the dispossessed Irish found themselves outsiders intheir own country. In 1641, the native Irish rebelled against the settlers.Unable to send troops to suppress the rebellion, King Charles I accepted aproposal whereby ten million acres of Irish land would be confiscated andused to repay those who would lend money to suppress the rebellion. 
In the Interregnum of 1649 to 1660, during which time England was
governed by the Cromwellian Commonwealth, the Treaty of Kilkenny 1649was agreed, which guaranteed religious toleration and an independent
457 Religious faith was reinforced by missionaries from the Continent.

Parliament for Ireland. However, in light of continuing opposition to English
rule, Cromwell landed in Ireland in July 1649 with an army intent onsuppressing dissent. By May 1652, the conquest was complete. The terms ofsettlement were set out in the Act for Settlement of Ireland, and included theprovision that every Irish landowner would have his estate forfeited unless hecould prove that he had shown ‘constant good affection to the interests of theCommonwealth of England’. During the Commonwealth, an estimated 36,000immigrant settlers were given land, much of it in Ulster. An estimated 8,000Catholic landowners were thus displaced from their lands, to be replaced byEnglish soldiers, who accepted land in lieu of pay, and by those who had lentmoney to the government for suppression of the rebellion. By 1660, whenCharles II was restored to the throne, the share of land owned by nativeCatholics had declined from 60 per cent to 20 per cent of the total. An attempt– under the Act of Settlement of 1661 – to preserve the land of existinglandowners and to restore land to those who had suffered in the Crown’scause was doomed to fail because, quite simply, there was insufficient land tomeet the claims. Notwithstanding such attempts to redress past injustices, theAct of Explanation of 1665 declared that, in disputes between Catholics andProtestants, Protestants were to be favoured. The Act of Settlement was to be acontinuing source of conflict.
James II, having fled England for Catholic France in 1688, arrived in
Ireland in 1689 in an attempt to restore his English Crown. The IrishParliament – in which, at that time, Roman Catholics formed a majority –repealed the Act of Settlement and restored freedom of religion. In response,William III despatched an army to Ireland, and at the Battle of the Boyne in1690, James was defeated. Protestants were once again in the ascendancy.Following James’s defeat, and the repression which followed, some 12,000Roman Catholics went into exile. 
Throughout the reign of William and Mary (1689–1702), and that of Queen
Anne (1702–14), further measures were introduced to confirm Protestantsupremacy. Catholics were excluded from parliament, the civil service, armedforces, local government and the professions. An Act of 1728 deprivedCatholics of the electoral franchise. Roman Catholics were prohibited fromacquiring land and from sending their children to university. On the death ofa Catholic, by law his lands were compulsorily divided between all hischildren, but if there was a Protestant heir, he was to take precedence. Bythese various means, Catholics were excluded from participation in public life.Some redress occurred in 1792 when the Relief Act allowed Roman Catholicsto practise law and to vote, although not to stand for election to parliamentwhich by now had become a Protestant body. 
From 1541, when Henry VIII took the title of King of Ireland and Supreme
Head of the Church of Ireland, Ireland was subject to the King’s rule. InWilliam’s reign, however, the issue which became contentious was whetherIreland was also subject to the English Parliament. From the standpoint ofEngland, Ireland was a colony and thus subject to the supremacy of theChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law
46

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
English Parliament. In 1719, a clash between the two Houses of Lords brought
the matter to the fore. Each House claimed the sovereign right to adjudicateupon Irish law. The Declaratory Act of the English Parliament gave full powerto the English Parliament to legislate for Ireland and denied the Irish House ofLords jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Irish courts. The Declaratory Actwas repealed in 1782, and the right of the Irish to be bound only by lawenacted by the Irish Parliament and the King was established. 
In 1791, the Society of United Irishmen was established in Belfast, with
Republicanism – full independence from England for an Irish State – as itspolitical platform. Although the majority of its membership was Protestant,the Society favoured Catholic emancipation.
8In the north, however, in 1794,
the Protestant and staunchly Unionist Orange Order was established.Mounting religious and political instability in Ireland culminated in the GreatRising of 1798. 
The Act of Union 1800
In an attempt to quell unrest and reach a lasting settlement, negotiations wereundertaken towards establishing political union between Ireland andEngland. The British Prime Minister, William Pitt, promised full Catholicemancipation. The resulting Act of Union 1800, which came into effect on 1January 1801, effected the union between Ireland and England on thetheoretical basis of equal independence for the two countries. The Kingdom ofIreland and the Kingdom of Great Britain were united under the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish interests were to be represented inthe United Kingdom’s House of Lords by 28 Irish peers and four bishops.Representation in the House of Commons was by 100 Irish members. TheHouse of Lords of the United Kingdom was the court of last resort. Demandsfor the repeal of the Act of Union were soon to be heard from Catholics whenthe promised emancipation was blocked by George III (1738–1820) – note thatthe King’s veto resulted in Pitt’s resignation – and demands made for reformsin relation to land law and education. These claims, in turn, were resisted byProtestants who feared that dissolution of the union and a revived IrishParliament would favour the Catholics.
The movement towards Home Rule9
Following the Napoleonic War in 1815, economic disaster was to strikeIreland. The economy was traditionally heavily dependent upon the potatocrop: in the mid 1800s, the crop failed. The effect of famine – starvation andemigration – was to decimate the Irish population.
10Demands for Home Rule
478 Official suppression of the Society took place in 1794.
9 See Morton, 1980; Jalland, 1980; O’Halpin, 1987.10 In 1841, the population was 8,175,124; in 1881, 5,174,836 and, by 1901, 4,458,775: census
figures.

began following the famine when many felt that the British government had
taken inadequate steps to deal with the economic crisis. The famine onceagain heightened demands for independence from England. 
Some reforms were introduced: in 1829, a Catholic Relief Act removed
discrimination in education and property and provided for Roman Catholicentry to civic and military offices. This emancipation in turn gave rise toincreased solidarity in the Unionist communities of the north and to furthersectarian violence. In 1836, a paramilitary national police force was set up, tobe known from 1867 as the Royal Irish Constabulary.
11
In 1869, the Anglican Church in Ireland was disestablished,12and in 1870
and 1881, Land Acts were introduced to regulate land rents and tenure.Electoral reforms in 1868, 1872 and 1884–85 introduced the secret ballot andextended the franchise. These measures, however, were not enough to quellIrish Catholic discontent. The land question was converted into a full scalecampaign for Home Rule for Ireland. Charles Stewart Parnell and MichaelDavitt (Member of Parliament for Meath) created the United Irish League, anorganisation designed to back Irish Home Rule members of the UnitedKingdom Parliament. Between 1879 and 1882, a violent campaign againstlandlords was undertaken. The government’s response was to suspendhabeas corpus, but at the same time to introduce further land reforms. Theviolence nevertheless continued: Irish republican leaders were arrested butsubsequently released in order to try to stop the bloodshed. In 1881, the brutalmurder of the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, andChief Under Secretary Thomas Burke was to turn public opinion in Englandagainst the Irish and put back the cause of Home Rule. 
With a total of 100 members, the Irish represented a significant block in the
Westminster Parliament. Following the 1885 general election, 85 of the 100elected members supported Home Rule in Ireland. They proceeded to exercisetheir power, blocking government legislation and campaigning for Irishindependence from Westminster. The Liberal Prime Minister, William EwartGladstone,
13sponsored the cause of Home Rule, but not that of a fully
independent Irish State. The aim, for the Liberals, was to introduceconstitutional reform which would ensure a degree of autonomy for an IrishParliament whilst retaining the supremacy of Westminster. By this means, itwas hoped that some form of devolution of power would be acceptable to theUnionists. 
This compromise solution was one adopted in other attempts at
devolution of power from Westminster. In 1867, by the British North AmericaAct, limited powers were devolved to Canada, as was later to be the case inChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Westminster Parliament retained ultimate sovereignty over the laws of each
country whilst conferring broad grants of legislative power to the coloniallegislature.
16
Home Rule Bills were introduced in the British Parliament in 1886 and
1893, but both were defeated – the first failing to pass the House of Commonsand the latter rejected by the House of Lords. The defeat of the Bills bothdisappointed the Nationalists and increased the insecurity of the Unionists.Substantive defects in the Bills proved insurmountable, with the centraldilemma turning on taxation and representation. If Ireland was to have itsown legislature – albeit subordinate to Westminster – it followed that IrishMembers of Parliament should be excluded from Westminster, since theyshould not be allowed to sit and vote on purely English and Scottish affairs.
17
Yet, if this were to be the case, it raised the spectre of the WestminsterParliament legislating for Irish taxation – a power reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament – without Irish representation.
Relations between England and Ireland were to deteriorate throughout the
first 20 years of the twentieth century. In 1905, Sinn Fein was established, withstrongly nationalist objectives. In the years 1911–12, there was industrialunrest in Ireland. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the scenewas set for Civil War in Ireland, an event only postponed by the War.
With Home Rule so firmly on the political agenda, Unionist opposition
intensified. For example, on 28 September 1912 (Ulster Day), some 400,000Ulster Protestants signed the Covenant, committing themselves to use ‘allmeans which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to setup a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland’ and ‘to refuse to recognise itsauthority’.
18In 1913, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a private army of over
100,000 men, was formed to protect Unionist interests against Republicandemands. The forming of the UVF led directly to the foundation of the IrishVolunteers, the forerunners of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). 
The issue of Home Rule for Ireland became, for the British, an issue which
demanded the separation of Ulster from the remainder of Ireland, rather thanHome Rule for the entire country. A Bill passed through parliament in 1914,but with the outbreak of the First World War was never put into effect, andthe intractable issue of separation of north from south was thus delayed.
19At
Westminster, the question of Home Rule had by now become a straight andpassionate party political issue, with the Conservatives and Ulster Unionists

opposing devolution and the Liberals and Irish members proposing
devolution. 
The Easter Rising 191620
In 1916, an event occurred which was to prove to be a decisive factor in theHome Rule story. Nationalists in Dublin, under the leadership of PatrickPearse, James Connolly and Michael Collins, initiated an uprising. On EasterMonday, some 1,600 members of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Armyembarked on a rebellion, proclaiming republican status for Ireland.
21
Six days later, the rebels surrendered with a loss of life of 132 soldiers and
policemen and 397 wounded, and 318 civilian deaths and 2,217 wounded.Three thousand five hundred people were arrested and court-martialled.Fifteen men were executed: 14 in Dublin and one in Cork. While the uprisingwas unsuccessful, its effect, and the brutal response of the British, was toconsolidate the nationalist cause and to win the support of the CatholicChurch. Sinn Fein membership grew and electoral success followed in the1918 general election, with Sinn Fein members having a majority throughoutthe country except in the staunchly Unionist area of the north east. Sinn Feinsecured 73 seats and 48 per cent of the votes cast. The Unionists secured only29 per cent of votes.
Civil War: 1919–22
Sinn Fein was banned in 1918, and its leader, Eamon De Valera, arrested.Members of Sinn Fein refused to take their seats in Westminster and insteadissued a Declaration of Independence and established the first IrishParliament – the Dail Eireann. Civil unrest again erupted, with the Irish War of
Independence
22lasting until 1921. The war was, essentially, a programme of
terrorism directed against the authorities. The government passed theRestoration of Order in Ireland Act in 1920, providing for internment ofsuspects while at the same time seeking to implement Home Rule. Thesavagery with which the army and Royal Irish Constabulary dealt with thetroubles provoked disgust and outrage: pressure on the government frompublic opinion at home and overseas necessitated a truce. 
Partition: the Government of Ireland Act 1920
By 1919, it had become clear that there could be no single Home RuleParliament for a united Republic of Ireland. In light of the continuing andincreasing sectarian bitterness and civil unrest, the British government becameChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

War.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
resigned to a divided Ireland. In 1920, the United Kingdom Parliament passed
the Government of Ireland Act under which the country was partitioned, withsix of the original nine Ulster counties being separated from the remainder ofIreland.
23Under the Government of Ireland Act, a Council of Ireland was to
be established, having exclusive jurisdiction over a number of all Irelandmatters.
24
Six northern counties,25characterised by a majority population of
Protestants, were henceforth to be separately represented by a separateparliament from that of southern Ireland. The Act provided for two HomeRule Parliaments, with Westminster retaining ultimate sovereignty: 
Notwithstanding ... anything contained in this Act, the supreme authority of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected andundiminished over all persons, matters, and things in Ireland and every partthereof [Government of Ireland Act 1920, s 75].
The Parliament of Southern Ireland – the Dail – rejected the Act, and the war
of independence continued. In Northern Ireland, however, the Home Rule
Parliament opened in 1921. In December 1921, following intensivenegotiations, Articles of Agreement were signed by Irish delegates. TheArticles provided for the partition of Ireland; for the creation of an Irish FreeState with Dominion status
26under the Crown, to be represented by a
Governor General. By a narrow majority, the Irish Parliament, the Dail,
accepted the agreement.
The Anglo-Irish Treaty 1921
The Anglo-Irish Treaty gave to southern Ireland (the ‘Irish Free State’) self-governing dominion status, equivalent to that of Canada, within theCommonwealth. The Parliament of Northern Ireland was given the choice asto whether or not it should be part of the Irish Free State. When it decided thatit should not, the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1922provided that the 1920 Act, which regulated the respective powers of thesouthern and northern parliaments and their relationships with Westminstershould cease to apply to any part of the Irish Free State and that its operationwas confined to Northern Ireland. 
In 1922, the Irish Free State Constitution was published, and ratified by the
Westminster Parliament in the Irish Free State (Constitution) Act 1922. Warwas not to end, however, and on 28 June 1922 the Irish Civil War began, withthe IRA leading the campaign against the Treaty. The war ended in 1923, butthe anti-treaty forces refused to surrender their arms.

Ireland.
24 Railways, fisheries and contagious diseases in animals.
25 Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone.
26 As enjoyed by Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
27 The same position pertained in 1999.

Within the newly separated north, with a Protestant Unionist population
of 56.4 per cent of the total, sectarian strife continued. In two years, over 400
people died, the majority being Catholics. The government responded withthe Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act of 1922, which provided forinternment of suspected terrorists without trial. The Act was to remain inforce until 1972; see, further, Chapter 23. 
The Constitution of the Irish Free State 1937
In 1931, the Statute of Westminster conferred greater freedom on the powersof Dominions. In Ireland, the Prime Minister (the Taoiseach ), Eamon de Valera
(1882–1975), introduced major changes: in 1933, it was announced that Irelandwas to become a de facto Republic. The Senate – the upper House of
Parliament – was abolished; the Governor General was stripped of hispowers. In addition, Irish citizens lost their British citizenship. The right ofappeal to the Privy Council was abolished. 
In 1937, de Valera drafted and published the Constitution of the Irish Free
State. The Constitution declared independence from the United Kingdom,declaring in Article I that: 
The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right
to choose its own form of government, to determine its relations with othernations, and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural, in accordancewith its own genius and traditions.
Under Article 2, the constitution declared Ireland to be a unitary, not divided,
state, thus refusing to accept the constitutional position of Northern Ireland asestablished under the 1920 Act:
The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the
territorial seas. 
Furthermore, it was declared in Article 5 that: 
Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State.
It was not, however, until 1949 that the United Kingdom Parliament was to
accept separation and pass the Ireland Act 1949, which formally severedconstitutional ties. The Republic withdrew from the Commonwealth in thesame year. 
Self-government in Northern Ireland 1920–72
From 1920 until 1972, Northern Ireland enjoyed a measure of self-governmentrepresented by the parliament at Stormont. The Northern Ireland Parliamenthad powers to make laws for ‘the peace, order and good government ofNorthern Ireland’. In effect, this meant law and order, the police and lowercourts, local government, health and social services, education, planning andinternal trade, agriculture and finance.
28Westminster retained reservedChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law
5228 See Palley, 1972.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
powers and ultimate sovereignty over the territory.29Sectarian strife, in
addition to the reserved legislative powers, ensured that the United Kingdom
government continued to play a role in Northern Ireland. 
The Northern Ireland Parliament was bicameral, the House of Commons
being elected by the people, the Senate being elected by members of theHouse of Commons. The Executive was headed by the Governor, appointedby the Crown. In the first elected parliament of 1921, the Unionists held amajority and thus formed the government, a feature which was to be repeatedin every election until the constitution was suspended in 1972. 
Not only was there a continuous Unionist majority in the House of
Commons, but there was also Unionist dominance in local government: acontributing factor to the discontent of the Catholic community. Furtherdisquiet arose over the composition of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and inparticular the force of ‘B Specials’,
30all Protestant, which gained a reputation
for violence. Catholic membership of the entire police force in NorthernIreland was never to be above 20 per cent of the total. The allocation of publichousing also became a matter of discontent. In the attempt to separateCatholics from Protestants, the housing allocated to Catholics proved to be ofa poorer standard than that offered to the Protestants. Education wassegregated, again on religious grounds. Mutual distrust between the twocommunities within Northern Ireland intensified as a result of religion.
The ‘Troubles’: 1968–98
In 1968, a campaign of civil disobedience and unrest began. The target for theviolence was twofold: the discrimination which existed against Catholics inmany sectors of life – such as housing, employment and the local governmentfranchise – and the continued union with the mainland. The civil disturbancesled to a Commission of Inquiry which reported a ‘widespread sense ofpolitical and social grievances for long unaudited and therefore ignored bysuccessive governments of Northern Ireland’.
31By the summer of 1969,
British troops were deployed in support of the police, whose operationalcontrol over security matters became subject to military control. In 1970, theProvisional Sinn Fein Party was formed and, in 1971, the Reverend Ian Paisleyfounded the Democratic Unionist Party. The Civil Authorities Special PowersAct (Northern Ireland) 1922 was used to intern suspected Irish Republicanterrorists without trial – a factor which increased rather than decreasedsympathy for the nationalist cause. On 30 January 1972, 13 Catholic civilianswere shot dead by British paratroopers in the course of a banned civil rights

march in Derry (‘Bloody Sunday’). By the end of 1972, 474 deaths had
occurred in the escalation of sectarian killings by Protestant murderers andthe IRA. 
Internment and allegations of ill treatment of detainees led to legal
proceedings being initiated against the United Kingdom by the Republic ofIreland government under the European Convention on Human Rights.
32The
Crompton Report of 197133outlined the interrogation methods used as
including continuous noise, deprivation of food, water and sleep, and wallstanding. Three Privy Counsellors
34were appointed to examine the
procedures. Unable to reach agreement, two differing reports werepublished.
35The majority report concluded that the techniques would be
acceptable provided adequate safeguards were introduced in relation to theiruse. Lord Gardiner, however, a former Labour Lord Chancellor, ruled that theprocedures used were unlawful:
If it is to be made legal to employ methods not now legal against a man whom
the police believe to have, but who may not have, information which the policedesire to obtain, I, like many of our witnesses, have searched for, but beenunable to find, either in logic or in morals, any limit to the degree of illtreatment to be legalised. The only logical limit to the degree of ill treatmentwould appear to be whatever degree of ill treatment proves to be necessary toget the information out of him, which would include, if necessary, extremetorture. I cannot think that Parliament should, or would, so legislate.
The government accepted Lord Gardiner’s view, and the interrogation
procedures were abandoned. The European Court of Human Rights ruledthat the procedures amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contraryto Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights but that they did not amountto torture. 
Some reforms designed to improve relations between the Catholic
community and the Unionists were introduced by the Northern IrelandParliament. A Northern Ireland Parliamentary Commissioner forAdministration was appointed to deal with complaints against publicauthorities,
36and a Commissioner for Complaints37established to investigate
allegations based on discrimination in employment. 
Prorogation of the Northern Ireland Parliament 1972
In 1972, with the violence unabated and the civilian death toll mounting, theUnited Kingdom government once again assumed responsibility for theChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

province.38The Northern Ireland Parliament was prorogued indefinitely and
the powers of the Northern Ireland government transferred to a Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland. A review of the Special Powers Act and internmentwas undertaken in 1972.
39Confirming the need for detention without trial as
a short term measure for certain alleged offences, the Committeerecommended the introduction of special courts which would sit without ajury: the ‘Diplock Courts’.
40
Power sharing 1973
In 1973, following the prorogation of Stormont and a referendum, a newsystem of power sharing between the Northern Ireland Assembly and theWestminster Parliament was introduced.
41Under the Northern Ireland
Assembly Act 1973 and the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, anAssembly was to be established, having 78 members elected under the singletransferable vote system.
42The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973
provided a statutory guarantee that Northern Ireland should remain part ofthe United Kingdom until the time at which a majority of the people, voting ina referendum, should determine otherwise.
43Representation of Northern
Ireland at Westminster was increased to 17 Members of Parliament. In areferendum held in 1973
44on the question of union with the United Kingdom,
a majority favoured continuation of the union.45
Direct rule 1974
The breakdown of that system resulted in the Northern Ireland Act of 1974,the result of which was the restoration of direct rule by Westminster overNorthern Ireland. 
Further attempts were made to dismantle the discrimination which
continued to exist in fields of housing and employment.
46Section 17 of the
Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 provided that any Northern Irelandlegislation which discriminated against persons on the basis of religion orpolitical belief was void.

Policy Studies Institute reported that the legislation had little impact on the
attitudes of employers.48
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a virtual civil war existed.49From 1971 to
1977, ‘an average of 252 persons were killed and 3,269 shootings haveoccurred each year; for the years 1978–81, the averages have fallen,respectively, to 82 and 1,574’.
50In 1975, a further attempt to devolve power to
the province was made when a Constitutional Convention was elected.51The
attempt failed as a result of the Unionists’ insistence that they retain a majorityin any new Assembly. The Northern Ireland Act 1982 nevertheless providedfor a new Assembly, to be elected by proportional representation, whichinitially was designed to be a debating and deliberative forum which would,in the future, propose plans for a new form of devolved government inNorthern Ireland.
52The Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Fein
members refused to take their seats. Faced with political deadlock, theAssembly was dissolved in 1986. In 1983, the New Ireland Forum wasestablished, in which the major political parties in the south and north wererepresented. The outcome of deliberations was the Anglo-Irish Agreement,signed by the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Republic ofIreland in 1985.
53
The Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985
The Agreement endorsed the principle that no constitutional changeconcerning the relationship between the north and south could come aboutother than with the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland.That majority did not currently exist. In the absence of such consent, it wasagreed that there should be closer co-operation in relation to security,economic, social and cultural matters and the promotion of reconciliationbetween the two parts of Ireland. An Inter-governmental Conference wasestablished with a membership drawn from representatives of both south andnorth to consider reforms across a range of issues. The British governmentundertook to consider any recommendations made, although the ultimatesovereignty over Northern Ireland remained firmly in the United Kingdom.Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the work of the Inter-governmentalConference was to be reviewed after three years. Reforms implemented sincethe Agreement included the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989,which aimed at removing discrimination in employment, and theintroduction of an independent Commission for Police Complaints.Chapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
The Joint Declaration 1993
In 1993, a Joint Declaration was signed between the British and Irish
governments. The Declaration recognised and renewed the commitment topreservation of the union with the United Kingdom for as long as a majorityof the people of Northern Ireland so wished. The Declaration also, however,indicated for the first time that the British government had ‘no selfish,strategic or economic interest’ in Northern Ireland, thus officially givingrecognition to the neutrality of the government’s position over the long termfuture of the province. In September 1994, the IRA announced a ceasefire ofhostilities. The British government responded with cautious optimism. In thesame month, and as a response to the ceasefire, the government announcedthat the ban on live sound broadcasts by members of Sinn Fein would belifted. The exclusion order on the President of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams,was also lifted.
54
In 1995, with the lasting of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland, the prospects
for peace in Northern Ireland were higher than at any time in the past. Fullnegotiations between Sinn Fein and the British government were, however,delayed, in part by a dispute over the terms for negotiation and in part overthe refusal of the IRA to relinquish its armoury of weapons
55in advance of
peace talks.
The fragile hopes of 1995 were dashed in February 1996 when the IRA
bombed Canary Wharf in London, thus ending the ceasefire. Further IRAaction took place on the mainland, but not initially in Northern Ireland itself.In December 1996, the British government announced the terms for includingSinn Fein in all party discussions for the purpose of reaching a settlement.These included the announcement of a permanent ceasefire – proof that theIRA would bring the violence permanently to an end. The government’sdemands were rejected by Gerry Adams, and criticised by the Prime Ministerof the Irish Republic.
The 1998 peace settlement
The election of the Labour government in May 1997 led to renewed efforts torevitalise the peace talks. In September 1997, following a renewal of theceasefire by the IRA, and Sinn Fein’s renunciation of the use of force, peacetalks commenced between all parties. In February 1998, however, followingrenewed violence, Sinn Fein was expelled from the talks, but told that it couldreturn if violence ceased. The Chairman of the talks, George Mitchell, inMarch set a 15 day deadline on the talks, which culminated in formalproposals being drawn up. On Good Friday, 10 April 1998, agreement wasfinally reached.
5754 On emergency legislation in respect of Northern Ireland, see Chapter 23.
55 As the IRA refused to do in 1923: see above, p 51.

The agreement centred on five principal points. First, the principle that
Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom was endorsed,
and the Republic of Ireland agreed to amend its Constitution to remove itsclaim to Northern Ireland (Articles 2 and 3). Secondly, a Northern IrelandAssembly of 108 members was to be elected under a system of proportionalrepresentation. The Assembly is run by an executive of 12 members. Thirdly, aNorth-South ministerial council was to be established by the Assembly inorder to co-ordinate relations between Ireland and Ulster. Fourthly, a Councilof the Isles was to be established, its membership to be drawn from theparliaments at Westminster, Dublin, Edinburgh and the Welsh Assembly.Finally, all participants expressed the commitment to the disarmament ofparamilitary organisations, a commitment the fulfilment of which was acondition for the devolution of power.
In order for the agreement to take effect, referendums were held in both
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the vote infavour of the agreement was 71.12 per cent, with a turnout of 80.98 per cent. Inthe Irish Republic, 94.40 per cent voted for the agreement, the turnout being55.47 per cent. In June 1998, elections were held for membership of theNorthern Ireland Assembly. The results of the election produced an Assemblywith power shared by the four main political parties, with five minorityparties winning 18 seats between them.
56
In 1999, the devolution of power was complete, the Assembly elected and
a power sharing executive in place. As noted above, however, the fulldevolution of power was conditional on agreement being reached over thedecommissioning of paramilitary weapons. When the IRA refused to co-operate and it became clear that decommissioning was not to occur, theAssembly was suspended, and power returned to Westminster under theNorthern Ireland Act 2000, to be restored once again following furthernegotiations. The position relating to the Northern Ireland Assembly will bereturned to in Chapter 12.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
The early history – an overview
The historical relationship between England and Scotland is one marked by
conflict and war resulting from English attempts at seizing sovereignty overScotland. Perhaps the original force uniting the two countries was themarriage, in 1503, of James IV of Scotland to Margaret, Henry VII’s daughter.When Elizabeth I of England died in 1603, without leaving an heir to thethrone, Henry VII’s great-great-grandson – then James VI of Scotland –succeeded to the throne of England as James I.
58Despite this union, each
country retained its own constitution and parliament and – separated byreligious differences and economic rivalry – the two countries were to remainseparate for a further century. 
In Calvin’s Case (1608), it was held that persons born in either of the
kingdoms, after James’s accession to the English throne, held dual nationality,all owing allegiance to the same Crown. James’s accession was not, however,to lay past conflicts to rest. James ruled Scotland from London, much ofgovernment in practice being conducted by the Scottish Privy Council actingon the King’s orders. The Scottish Parliament seldom met and was dominatedby the Lords of the Articles, who were royal nominees. Within Scotland,conflict arose in the form of religious dispute with the King, who attempted tocurb the power of the Presbyterian Kirk in Scotland, in 1606 exiling one of itsleaders, Andrew Melville. In 1608, in the Five Articles of Perth , the King
ordered certain religious practices to be undertaken which were regarded bythe puritans as ‘popery’,
59as was the Prayer Book drawn up at James’s
command in 1619. 
It was in the reign of Charles I (1625–49) that open conflict on the religious
question emerged. Charles attempted to impose James’s Prayer Book on theKirk (the Scottish Church). The end result, in brief, was that the Scotsopponents of his attempted reforms – the Covenanters – played a significantrole in Charles’s defeat in the Civil War which led to his trial, conviction andexecution as ‘a tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the good peopleof this nation’.
60
From 1649–60, during the ‘interregnum’ (the period between the execution
of Charles I and the restoration of the monarchy), Scotland was to be ruled bythe military, whilst theoretically integrated into the Cromwellian unitedRepublic of England and Scotland. On restoration of the monarchy, religiouspersecution of the Scottish Presbyterians was rife. The Scottish Parliament,under the control of the Lords of the Articles, proved impotent, and wasdissolved by Charles II (1649–85; in exile until 1660). In 1666, provoked bypersecution, the Pentland Rising against the Crown occurred. Whileunsuccessful, it prompted Charles towards greater religious tolerance.

59 Adherence to the Roman Catholic faith.
60 Cited in Lockyer, 1985, p 288.

In 1688, when James II (1685–89) was forced to flee England, the Scots took
the opportunity to assert their constitutional and religious liberties against
William and Mary (1689–1702). The Claim of Right – the Scottishconstitutional settlement with the Crown – went much further than its Englishcounterpart, the Petition of Right. The Scots claimed that parliament had theright to depose any King who violated the trust on which his powers wereheld, and William was not to establish his supremacy in Scotland withoutblood being shed. Rebellious Highland chiefs, who refused to submit toWilliam’s authority, were massacred at Glencoe in 1692, as an example toothers. Scottish hostility towards the Crown was further exacerbated by theNavigation Acts, which treated Scotland and England as separate entities. Asa response, acting alone, and without royal support, the Scots raised revenuesfor an expedition to Panama. Three expeditions set out but failed, beingdecimated either by disease or military opposition from the Spanish Armada.The English, meanwhile, continued to exclude Scotland from its commercialempire. The Scottish response to such discrimination was to declare thatScotland would not be committed to either war or peace by English policy
61
and that the succession to the Hanoverian Crown62would not be accepted by
Scotland unless and until constitutional, economic and religious liberties wereguaranteed to the Scottish people. 
The only long term solution to such conflicts of interest was the full union
of England and Scotland. The Act of Union with Scotland
63was passed in
1707, ‘abolishing’ the respective sovereign parliaments which became unitedunder the title of the Parliament of Great Britain. The Act of Unionrepresented the culmination of years of negotiations between the twocountries following centuries of intermittent hostilities. As will be seen inChapter 6, when union came about, it was to be subject to strict conditionsand terms. In particular, the Act of Union protects the separate Scottish legalsystem – both in relation to private law and to the court structure – andprovided special protection for the Presbyterian Church. There was, however,to be a common parliament, common flag, taxation and coinage: by this,meaningful political and economic union was secured.
The Wars of Independence between England and Scotland in the Middle
Ages, culminating in the recognition of an independent Scotland in 1328, hadresulted in a complete break between English law and Scottish law. TheScottish looked to continental Europe for their training and law, and thusadopted the civil law system based originally on Roman law, which had neverbeen fully adopted in England. Under the terms of the union, the highest civiland criminal courts – the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary –were to remain outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. The High CourtChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
of Justiciary has remained the final court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases,
while in civil cases the House of Lords has appellate jurisdiction.64
Following the union, Scottish interests were represented by a Secretary of
State for Scotland. From 1745, responsibility for Scotland passed to a Secretaryof State who also held other responsibilities, such as Home Affairs. In 1885,the office of Secretary for Scotland was established, which, from 1892, becamea Cabinet post. Administrative devolution to Scotland included Boardscreated to administer agriculture, fisheries, local government, prisons, healthand education, each operating under the supervision of the Scottish Secretaryof State. 
In 1952, a Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs
65was appointed to
review government functions in relation to Scotland. Further responsibilitieswere transferred to the Scottish Secretary of State: appointment of Justices ofthe Peace, animal health, highways and electricity. Subsequently, roadpassenger transport, ancient monuments, royal parks and palaces have beentransferred. The Scottish Office, established in 1945, comprises fivedepartments: Agriculture and Fisheries, Development, Education, Home andHealth. The administration is based in Edinburgh and headed by theSecretary of State, ministers of state and under secretaries. 
Responsibility for the administration of the criminal law in Scotland lies
with the Lord Advocate who is normally a member of the House of Commonsbut may, alternatively, be a member of the House of Lords, having beenconferred a life peerage. The Lord Advocate has responsibility for aspects ofgovernment business affecting Scotland. Representation in parliament wasdetermined by the Act of Union at 45, but has since increased to 72.
66
The Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969–7367recommended the
devolution of legislative power to Scotland. As with Wales, the legislationcould only come into effect following a referendum which returned a majorityof voters in favour, having secured a minimum of 40 per cent of all eligiblevoters.
68The results of the referendum in Scotland were 32.5 per cent in
favour of devolution, 30.4 per cent against, with 37.1 per cent of votersabstaining. The statutory requirements for an electoral majority being unmet,the Scotland Act 1978 was repealed.

68 See Bogdanor, 1980.69 The Royal Commission had not been unanimous in its support of devolution for either
Wales or Scotland, and a powerful Memorandum of Dissent was published with the
report: op cit, fn 67, Vol 2 .

Nevertheless, the devolution issue – particularly in relation to Scotland –
had not been finally laid to rest. Following the general election in 1987, the
Conservative government, despite having a majority of seats in England, wononly ten out of 72 seats in Scotland. The results of the 1992 election, whilstslightly better in terms of government representation, still resulted in Scotlandbeing under-represented in parliament. 
The by-election of May 1995, following the death of a Conservative
Member of Parliament, resulted in the Scottish Nationalist Party winning theseat. The Conservative government therefore had little electoral support northof the border in general elections or by-elections, a fact which was alsoreflected in local government elections. This ‘democratic deficit’ of theConservative government continued to fuel the fires of the demand for greaterdevolution of power to Scotland. The 1997 general election resulted in therebeing no Scottish Conservative Members of Parliament.
Devolution to Scotland70
The general election of 1997 presaged the devolution of power to a ScottishParliament. The government’s White Paper, Scotland’s Parliament ,
71while
retaining the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament (paragraph 4.2),envisaged devolution of law making power to the Scottish Parliament, and alimited power to vary levels of taxation, while also reserving to the UnitedKingdom Parliament legislative capacity in relation to certain matters.Whether or not powers are devolved or reserved, the Scottish Parliament isentitled to debate all matters (paragraph 2.5). The Scotland Act 1998 gaveeffect to the proposals for devolution, approved by the people through areferendum. The Scottish Parliament and the Executive are discussed inChapter 12.
WALES72
Wales covers an area of some 8,000 square miles, having a populationapproximately five per cent of that of the United Kingdom. 
The early history – an overview
Wales was conquered by the English in 1282, and from 1284,73Wales was
subject to English law. A rebellion in the early fifteenth century sought toChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
overthrow English rule but, after initial success, collapsed. The enduring
union between England and Wales was formally effected by Act of Parliamentin 1536.
74English became the official language for Wales, and use of the
Welsh language officially banned, although in 1563, Elizabeth I ordered thatthe bible be translated into Welsh in order to ensure compliance with theProtestant religion, and by this means ensured that the Welsh languagesurvived.
75All Acts of Parliament were deemed to extend to Wales.
Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nationalist feelingincreased, with demands for greater recognition and representation of Welshinterests. Nationalism became an overtly political issue at the end of thenineteenth century with the establishment of the Wales of the FutureMovement ( Cymru Fydd ), although separatism was not a demand. Welsh
Liberals sought national educational institutions
76and disestablishment of the
Welsh Church rather than a Welsh Parliament.77In 1925, Plaid Cymru was
established to promote the Welsh language and further Welsh interests andparliamentary representation, although its electoral success was slight.
Administrative decentralisation to Wales has taken place in a number of
areas. In addition to education,
78national insurance was to be separately
administered in Wales,79and agricultural interests separately represented.80
In 1951, the office of Minister for Welsh Affairs was established and, in
1964, the first Secretary of State for Wales was appointed with theresponsibility for overseeing the execution of national policy in Wales. In 1969,the Royal Commission on the Constitution recommended by a majority thatthere should be greater devolution of power to Wales.
81The scheme
envisaged establishing a Welsh legislature (a Senate) with the power tolegislate on specifically defined matters. Existing legislation of the UnitedKingdom Parliament would continue to apply in Wales, but future legislation– provided that the subject matter fell within the area of power devolved –would be for the Welsh Parliament. The United Kingdom Parliament wouldretain power to legislate over certain matters and the United Kingdomgovernment would retain sovereignty and the ultimate power in exceptional

circumstances to override legislation passed by the Welsh Senate. The Senate
would comprise a single, 100 member chamber, elected on the basis ofproportional representation and having a fixed term of four years. Welshinterests would, however, continue to be represented in the United KingdomParliament. The Wales Act 1978 gave effect to devolution. However, in orderfor the Act to come into effect, it was necessary for those voting in favour ofdevolution to be in a majority of the votes cast and to represent a minimum of40 per cent of those entitled to vote. The voting in Wales was 11.9 per cent infavour, 46.6 per cent against with 41.7 per cent abstaining. Accordingly, theAct was not to be brought into effect. The Labour government elected in 1997committed itself to devolution to both Scotland and Wales. In the case ofWales, the proposal was for the establishment of a Welsh Assembly, withprincipally administrative powers, and subject to the overriding sovereigntyof the United Kingdom Parliament. The reforms effected in 1998 are discussedin Chapter 12. 
THE BRITISH ISLANDS
The United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man togethercomprise the British Islands.
82Accordingly, while the islands are not part of
the United Kingdom, they are part of Her Majesty’s dominions. Citizens of theislands are treated as citizens of the United Kingdom for the purposes of theBritish Nationality Act 1981.
The Channel Islands83
The Channel Islands comprise the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney andSark. Historically part of the Duchy of Normandy, the Channel Islandsremained in allegiance to the King of England when Normandy was lost bythe English in 1204. The islands are organised under two separate Bailiwicks:the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, which includesAlderney and Sark. Each Bailiwick enjoys its own legislature, court structureand system of law. Alderney and Sark, whilst part of the Guernsey Bailiwick,enjoy a large measure of independence, having their own legislativeassemblies. 
The States of Jersey comprises 52 elected members and five non-elected
members. The States of Guernsey comprises 61 members. Official linksbetween the Crown and the United Kingdom government are through theLieutenant Governor of the Bailiwicks. The legislature – the States – is headedby the Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff. Chapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
The Isle of Man
The Isle of Man became formally linked with England in 1405. From that time
until 1765, it was ruled by ‘Kings’ or ‘Lords’ of Man. Under Acts of Parliamentof 1765
84and 1825,85the Westminster Parliament assumed, in the name of the
Crown, the rights of the Lords. In 1958, under the Isle of Man Act of that year,much control over the Isle was relinquished by Westminster. The Isle enjoysfull powers of self-government and has its own system of courts and law. Thehead of the Executive, the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, is theformal link between the local administration and the Crown and UnitedKingdom government. The parliament (the Court of Tynwald) has executiveand legislative functions. It comprises the Lieutenant Governor, theLegislative Council and the House of Keys. The lower House – the House ofKeys – has 24 members elected on a constituency basis for a five year term ofoffice. The Legislative Council comprises the senior Bishop, the AttorneyGeneral, a judge and seven members elected by the House of Keys. 
The constitutional relationship between the islands and the
United Kingdom
The constitutional position of the islands is thus unique. In some respects, they
are like miniature States with wide powers of self-government ...86
The Crown has ultimate responsibility for the islands. Under international
law, the United Kingdom government is responsible both for the islands’international relations and for their defence. Where legislative measures are toextend to the islands, these are effected through the Privy Council. Acts ofParliament only extend to the islands if the statute expressly so provides, orwhere the Act applies to all Her Majesty’s dominions ‘by necessaryimplication’.
87The Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey do not accept that either
the United Kingdom Parliament or the Queen in Council have the power tolegislate for them without the consent of the local legislatures and registrationin the Royal Court. Contrary to the accepted doctrine of parliamentarysupremacy, the Channel Islands deny that Acts of Parliament or prerogativeacts, under Orders in Council, can take effect without local registration.

THE ISLANDS AND EUROPE
The European Community and Union
When the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Rome, special arrangements
had to be effected for the islands.88Under Article 227(4) of the Treaty of
Rome, the Treaty extends to all territories for which Member States haveresponsibility for their international relations. Were the Treaty to extendautomatically to the islands, it would confer power of the institutions of theCommunity to legislate for the islands in matters such as taxation which theUnited Kingdom Parliament, consistent with the convention, would have node facto power to legislate. Accordingly the islands sought special terms in
relation to membership of the Community. The resulting solution was that theUnited Kingdom government negotiated special status for the islands inrelation to the Community: the islands are part of the Community for thepurpose of free movement of industrial and agricultural goods but not for thepurpose of free movement of persons or taxation provisions. 
The European Convention on Human Rights
While the position of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man vis à vis theEuropean Community is the same, the position is different in relation to theConvention. Initially, the Convention on Human Rights extended to both theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man, and nowadays it continues to apply tothe Channel Islands.
89While the Convention initially applied to the Isle of
Man, the case of Tyrer v United Kingdom (1978) brought about a change. In
Tyrer’s case, the European Court of Human Rights held that judicial birching
in the Isle of Man of a juvenile amounted to degrading punishment inviolation of Article 3 of the Convention. As a result, the Isle of Mangovernment requested that the right of individual petition under theConvention be withdrawn. The United Kingdom government acceded to therequest.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND AND WALES90
Local government antecedes central government by many centuries.Consideration will be given to local government in Chapter 12. Suffice here tonote that the country is divided into local authorities, each having law makingand administrative powers as delegated by parliament. Local authorities areentirely creatures of statute: accordingly, the only powers which they have arethose conferred by the sovereign Westminster Parliament. Increasingly,Chapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law

89 See Gillow v United Kingdom (1986).
90 Local government in Scotland and Northern Ireland is differently arranged.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
however, the law of the European Community requires action at local
authority level.
With the devolution of legislative power to the Scottish Parliament,
Northern Ireland Assembly and Welsh Assembly, and the government’scommitment to give further consideration to extending the principle ofregional government to English regions, significant changes have occurred tothe governmental structure of the United Kingdom.
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND UNION
The United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union representsperhaps the most significant challenge to the constitution. It is no longerpossible, realistically, to view the United Kingdom as an isolatedconstitutional entity. Rather, it must be viewed as a distinctive nation (orunion of distinctive nations) within the larger union. The aims and institutionsof the Union, its law making powers and the relationship between the law ofthe United Kingdom and European law will be discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE COMMONWEALTH91
From Empire to Commonwealth
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Britain embarked on empirebuilding, although the original expansion of British interests overseas wasessentially undertaken by private commercial companies. Where territory wastaken over by conquest, it became the property of the Crown.
92Legal
authority over such territories vested in the Crown and political control laywith the Privy Council.
The earliest ‘revolution’ against colonisation came with the American
Declaration of Independence in 1776 in which Britain was deprived of 13North American colonies. By the end of the nineteenth century, vast swathesof the world’s map were ‘coloured pink’ – that is to say, under British powerand control. The relationship between Britain and its colonies may becharacterised as the movement from full British sovereignty over theterritories through to increasing self-government and independence. In 1865,the Colonial Laws Validity Act was passed by the British Parliament in orderto clarify the relationship between British law and colonial law and thecapacity of colonial legislatures for self-regulation. While the Act confirmedself-regulating legislative capacity, it also affirmed the principle that suchdevolved powers were subject to the overriding sovereignty of the imperialparliament. 
6791 See, inter alia , Roberts-Wray, 1966; Dale, 1983; Wheare, 1960; de Smith, 1964.
92 Calvin’s Case (1608).

In 1867, Canada became the first self-governing Dominion (a status
implying equality with rather than subordination to Britain), to be followed
by Australia in 1900, New Zealand in 1907, South Africa in 1910 and the IrishFree State in 1921. The recognition that the Empire was being transformed intoa Commonwealth of Nations came in 1884.
The desire for formal recognition and explication of the constitutional
relationship between Britain and the Dominions led to four-yearly PrimeMinisterial conferences, commenced in 1887. The Imperial Conference of 1926adopted the Balfour Report which defined the Dominions as:
... autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no
way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or externalaffairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown, and freelyassociated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave formal recognition to this definition.
Section 2 of the Act extended the powers of Dominion legislatures to amendor repeal Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, although this power didnot extend to going against the limits on the Dominion’s legislative capacity aslaid down in the Acts containing that country’s constitution.
93
By the end of the Second World War in 1945, much of the remaining
British power had been repossessed by its rightful owners, either throughdirect resistance to British rule (as in India) or negotiated constitutionalsettlements between the British Crown and the formerly dependentterritory.
94From this time, what remained of the British Empire was
transformed into a loosely defined, voluntary Commonwealth of nations, ofwhich the British monarch represents the formal Head.
95While the
Commonwealth was originally characterised by its members’ allegiance to theBritish Crown, the movement towards republicanism forced a change indirection for the Commonwealth. It was Indian independence whichrepresented the catalyst for change. India had remained a Dominion under theIndia Act of 1935, until independence in 1947. In 1949, India’s desire tobecome a republic and yet remain within the Commonwealth posed a novelquestion concerning the allegiance to the British Crown. The LondonDeclaration of 1949 revised the position and enabled India to enter as the firstrepublican member. Heads of government also agreed, however, at thisChapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law
6893 See Harris v Minister of the Interior (1952); British Coal Corporation v R (1935) ; Ndlwana v
Hofmeyer (1937); and, further, Chapter 7. The constitutional position in relation to
Canada was defined by the British North America Act 1867, which contained no
amendment provisions. Accordingly, it remained for the United Kingdom Parliamentto amend the Canadian Constitution. This anomalous position was resolved in 1982 bythe Canada Act which ‘repatriated’ the Canadian Constitution. For a challenge to theAct, see Re Amendment of the Constitution of Canada (1981), discussed in Chapter 2.
94 The constitutional relationship between the United Kingdom Parliament and Australia
was finally resolved in 1986 under the Australia Act, which severed the legislative linkswith Westminster and terminated appeals from the Australian courts to the PrivyCouncil.
95 See, further, Dale, 1983; Roberts-Wray, 1966.

The Evolution of the Structure of the United Kingdom
meeting, that members would continue to recognise the Crown as the ‘symbol
of their free association and thus Head of the Commonwealth’, the positionwhich still pertains. 
The Commonwealth today
Unlike the European Union and Community, the Commonwealth isundefined by legal texts; it is not established nor regulated by treaty; nor doformal legal procedures regulate its inter-governmental relations. Rather, theCommonwealth is characterised by ‘bonds of common origin, history andlegal traditions’. The Commonwealth is made up of 54 countries,
96ranging
from monarchies – either under Queen Elizabeth II or national monarchs – torepublics.
97Nowadays, 32 members are republics and five have national
monarchies of their own, while 16 are constitutional monarchies whichrecognise Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. The total population of theCommonwealth is 1.7 billion. The shared history and traditions of Britain andother Commonwealth members, including legal traditions, provides the basisfor this voluntary association of states, which spans six continents and fiveoceans, and which operates without a formal Charter or Constitution.
The Commonwealth was defined in 1971 at the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) (CHOGMs take place every two years) as:
... a voluntary association of independent sovereign States, each responsible for
its own policies, consulting and cooperating in the common interests of theirpeoples and in the promotion of international understanding and worldpeace.
98
Further, at the 1971 CHOGM held in Singapore, Heads of Government issued
the Declaration of Commonwealth Principles. The principles include:
(a) the commitment to international peace in order to ensure the security and
prosperity of mankind;
(b) commitments to the liberty of the individual, irrespective of race, colour,
creed or political belief and the individual’s democratic right to participate
in democratic political processes;
(c) a commitment to combating racial discrimination;
(d) an opposition to all forms of colonial domination;(e) a commitment to removal of disparities in wealth between nations and to
raising standards of living; and
(f) a commitment to international co-operation.
These principles were reaffirmed and extended at the Harare CHOGM in
1991, which declared the Commonwealth’s commitment to promoting

equality within the context of sustainable economic and social development.Commonwealth members provide assistance to other countries in theirtransition to democracy by drafting legislation and reviewing electoralprocedures. 
The Commonwealth Secretariat
The Commonwealth is headed by a Secretary General. Under his stewardship,the Commonwealth Secretariat has been refashioned to enable it better toachieve Commonwealth objectives. The Secretariat was formed in 1965 andnow has 12 separate divisions.
99The operational arm of the Secretariat is the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, established in 1971,100
which, at the request of Commonwealth governments, provides: ‘… technicalassistance and expert advice on all issues within the Commonwealth’sagenda.’
101
Appeals from Commonwealth courts to the Privy Council 
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has jurisdiction to hear appealsfrom ‘dependencies of the Crown’. Deriving from the royal prerogative, thejurisdiction was given statutory force under the Judicial Committee Acts of1833 and 1844. Appeals may be with special leave of the Privy Council, orwithout leave. Appeals with special leave are predominantly criminal cases.Appeals against the death penalty represent the majority of appeals.
102
While, before independence, colonies had no power to abolish appeals to
the Privy Council, on independence, this power arose. As a result, a majorityof Commonwealth countries have abolished the right of appeal. The PrivyCouncil, however, continues to hear appeals from the Bahamas, Barbados,Belize, the Gambia, Guyana, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand,Singapore, and Trinidad and Tobago.
103Chapter 3: Constitutional and Administrative Law
7099 The Secretariat is funded by an assessed budget (in 1996–97, amounting to £120.4
million), contributed to by member governments on an agreed scale based on each
country’s population and income. In addition to the assessed budget are theCommonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, the Commonwealth YouthProgramme, and the Commonwealth Science Council, each of which has its ownbudget.
100 In 1996–97, the CFTC had an annual budget of £25 million.

the Export and Industrial Development Division; the General Technical Assistance
Services Division and the Management and Training Services Division.

PART II
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTS



CHAPTER 4
Where laws do not rule, there is no constitution.1
INTRODUCTION
The rule of law represents one of the most challenging concepts of the
constitution. The rule of law is a concept which is capable of differentinterpretations by different people, and it is this feature which renders anunderstanding of the doctrine elusive. Of all constitutional concepts, the ruleof law is also the most subjective and value laden. The apparent uncertaintiesin the rule of law and its variable nature should not cause concern, although,inevitably, it will cause some insecurity. In the study of the rule of law, it ismore important to recognise and appreciate the many rich and variedinterpretations which have been given to it, and to recognise the potential ofthe rule of law for ensuring limited governmental power and the protection ofindividual rights, than to be able to offer an authoritative, definitiveexplanation of the concept.
The rule of law may be interpreted either as a philosophy or political theory
which lays down fundamental requirements for law, or as a procedural device
by which those with power rule under the law. The essence of the rule of lawis that of the sovereignty or supremacy of law over man. The rule of lawinsists that every person – irrespective of rank and status in society – besubject to the law. For the citizen, the rule of law is both prescriptive – dictating
the conduct required by law – and protective of citizens – demanding that
government acts according to law. This central theme recurs whether thedoctrine is examined from the perspective of philosophy, or political theory,or from the more pragmatic vantage point of the rule of law as a proceduraldevice. The rule of law underlies the entire constitution and, in one sense, allconstitutional law is concerned with the rule of law. The concept is of greatantiquity and continues to exercise legal and political philosophers today. 
The rule of law cannot be viewed in isolation from political society. The
emphasis on the rule of law as a yardstick for measuring both the extent towhich government acts under the law and the extent to which individualrights are recognised and protected by law, is inextricably linked withWestern democratic liberalism.
2In this respect, it is only meaningful to speak
73THE RULE OF LAW
1 Aristotle, The Politics, Bk iv, para 1292a31.
2 See, inter alia , Fine, 1984; Hutchinson and Monahan, 1987; Neumann, 1986.

of the rule of law in a society which exhibits the features of a democratically
elected, responsible – and responsive – government and a separation ofpowers, which will result in a judiciary which is independent of government.In liberal democracies, therefore, the concept of the rule of law implies anacceptance that law itself represents a ‘good’; that law and its governance is ademonstrable asset to society. 
CONTRASTING ATTITUDES TO THE RULE OF LAW
It should not be assumed that this acceptance of law as a benevolent rulingforce is universally accepted. In differing societies, subscribing to verydifferent political philosophies, the insistence on the rule of law – in theWestern liberal sense – has little application. For example, from a Marxistperspective (on which see below, pp 82–83), the law serves not to restrictgovernment and protect individual rights but rather to conceal the injusticesinherent in the capitalist system. Accordingly, the concept of the rule of law –denoting some form of morality in law – represents no more than a falseidealisation of law designed to reinforce the political structure and economicstatus quo in society. Echoes of this thesis dominate the more moderatesocialist conceptions of the rule of law and the critique of liberalism. It can beargued – from the socialist perspective – that liberalism pays too little regardto true equality between persons and too great attention to the protection ofproperty interests. The liberal domain thus becomes one which, again, maskstrue social and economic inequality while at the same time proclaimingequality and justice under the rule of law.
3
The rule of law, as understood in liberal democracies, also has little
relevance in a totalitarian state. While it is true that such a state will be closelyregulated by law, there will not be government under the law – as adjudicatedupon by an independent judiciary – which is insisted upon under the liberaltradition.
In traditional Oriental society, the Western preference for law is an alien
notion. By way of example, in relation to traditional Chinese society, Davidand Brierley write:
For the Chinese, legislation was not the normal means of guaranteeing a
harmonious and smooth-working society. Laws, abstract in nature, could nottake into account the infinite variety of possible situations. Their strictapplication was apt to affect man’s innate sense of justice. To enact laws wastherefore considered a bad policy by traditional Chinese doctrine. The veryexactitude which laws establish in social relations, and the way in which theyfix the rights and obligations of each individual, were considered evils,according to the Chinese, not benefits. The idea of ‘rights’, an inevitabledevelopment of the laws themselves, ran counter to the natural order. OnceChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
743 For a critical account of the liberal tradition, see Lustgarten, 1988.

The Rule of Law
individuals think of their ‘rights’ there is, it was thought, some form of social
illness; the only true matter of concern is one’s duty to society and one’s fellowmen.
The enactment of laws is an evil, since individuals, once familiar with them,
will conclude that they have rights and will then be inclined to assert them,thereby abandoning the traditional rules of propriety and morality whichshould be the only guides to conduct. Legal disputes become numerous, and atrial, by reason of its very existence, is a scandalous disturbance of the naturalorder which may then lead to further disturbances of the social order to thedetriment of all society. [1966, p 442; and see 3rd edn, 1985, Title III, Chapter 1for the persistence of traditional ideas.]
In Japan, despite the nineteenth century adoption of codes based on French
and German models,4law, in the Western sense, remained largely irrelevant
to traditional Japanese life:
Still essential for the Japanese are the rules of behaviour ( giri-ninjo ) for each
type of personal relation established by tradition and founded, at least in
appearance, on the feelings of affection ( ninjo) uniting those in such
relationships. A person who does not observe these rules is seeking his owninterest rather than obeying the nobler part of his nature; he brings scorn uponhimself and his family. Apart from the contracts arising between important butdepersonalised business and industrial concerns, one does not attempt to haveone’s rights enforced in a court of law even though this is permitted by thevarious codes … [David and Brierley, 1966, p 458; see 3rd edn, Title III,Chapter 2.]
As the notion of the rule of law is dependent upon the political foundations of
a state, so, too, it is dependent – according to the approach adopted to theconcept – upon a nation’s economic resources. It may be that law, as a mereregulator of individual behaviour, is perfectly feasible in an impoverishedstate, and accordingly, a state which maintains law and order, and no more,can conform to a narrow interpretation of the rule of law which insists simplyon a citizen’s unquestioning compliance with rules of the law. However, if therule of law implies more than mere regulation by law and is elevated to atheory guaranteeing freedom from hunger and homelessness and entitlementto a basic decent standard of life, then economic conditions are of paramountimportance to conformity with the rule of law. Such an approach is adoptedby the International Commission of Jurists, which in the New DelhiDeclaration of 1959 included – alongside traditional civil and political rights –the realisation of social, economic, cultural and educational standards underwhich the individual could enjoy a fuller life within the ambit of the rule oflaw. On the other hand, reasoning such as this is anathema to radicalconservatives such as Friedrich von Hayek ((1944), 1994 and 1960), whoviewed the correct role of government as being best confined to establishing
754 Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure enacted in 1882; Codes on Judicial
Organisation and Civil Procedure 1890; Commercial Code 1899.

clear, fixed rules of law which ensure maximum economic freedom for
individuals, unimpeded either by planning controls or ideas of redistributivejustice. From von Hayek’s perspective, the rule of law requires no more thanthe existence of a stable set of minimum rules which are to be applied in auniform, non-discretionary manner. A legal system is viewed as just – and inconformity with the rule of law – if it exhibits both these features and anabsence of discretionary rules or practices.
UNCERTAINTY IN THE WESTERN RULE OF LAW
An understanding and appreciation of the rule of law is both politically andculturally dependent. Moreover, it is also clear that the rule of law has morethan one meaning, even within the Western liberal tradition. To sometheorists, the rule of law represents an aspirational philosophy; to others, nomore than a device under which compliance with law – good or bad incontent – is secured. It has been remarked that:
It would not be very difficult to show that the phrase ‘the rule of law’ has
become meaningless thanks to ideological abuse and general over-use.5
Partly as a result of such ‘over-use’, some writers have refuted the claim that
the rule of law represents anything other than a purely procedural orformalistic device. By way of example, Raz writes that the rule of law:
... says nothing about how the law is to be made: by tyrants, democratic
majorities, or any other way. It says nothing about fundamental rights, aboutequality, or justice.
6
Other writers have gone further. SA de Smith and R Brazier confine
discussion of the rule of law to a few paragraphs and, having acknowledgedthe past influence of Dicey’s ideas (but denied their contemporary relevance),state that it would not be ‘justifiable to examine the general concept of the ruleof law at length in this book’.
7
Contrast such a dismissive view with that expressed in the following
statement:
The rule of law is a rare and protean principle of our political tradition. Unlike
other ideals, it has withstood the ravages of constitutional time and remains acontemporary clarion-call to political justice. Apparently transcending partisanconcern, it is embraced and venerated by virtually all shades of politicalopinion. The rule of law’s central core comprises the enduring values ofregularity and restraint, embodied in the slogan of ‘a government of laws, not… men’.

The Rule of Law
In light of such divergent assessments, it must be recognised that any attempt
to align the rule of law with a broad philosophical doctrine – or indeed withany other interpretation – is likely to meet with opposition from somequarters. Notwithstanding such criticisms, the rule of law retains a securegrasp on political and legal thinking: in the words of Raz (1979), it has‘enduring importance as a central artefact in our legal and political culture’.
THE RULE OF LAW AS PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINE
The rule of law is an aspect of ancient and modern natural law thought.8In
essence, the natural law tradition – of which there are many strands – insiststhat the authority of law derives not from the power of any political ruler, butfrom a higher source, either theological or secular. The laws of man must beevaluated against the dictates of this ‘higher’ form of law. It is impossible toprovide more than a mere sketch of the rich history of natural law in Westernphilosophy and political thought and the legacy it gives to modernconstitutions. Nevertheless, a basic understanding of its nature and evolutionis instructive, for it reveals the manner in which the requirements of good law– morally worthwhile law – have been stipulated over centuries.
Natural law in ancient Greece and Rome 
Aristotle stated in The Politics that ‘the rule of law is preferable to that of any
individual’. The appeal to law as a control over naked power has beenapparent throughout history. At a philosophical level, the natural lawtradition, whether theological or secular, instructs that the power of man isnot absolute, but is rather controlled and limited by the requirements of ahigher law. To the ancient Greeks, man was under the governance of the lawsof nature – the natural forces which controlled the universe – although thisview is more closely aligned to the ‘law of nature’ than ‘natural law’ as it cameto be understood in later times. However, from the time of Socrates, Plato(427–347 BC) and Aristotle (384–322 BC), the quest for virtue – or goodness orjustice under the law – has been a recurrent theme. Socrates, teacher andphilosopher, was accused, tried and convicted by the grand jury of Athens forcorrupting youth with his teachings. Despite the possibility of escape, Socrateschose to accept the verdict of death which had been imposed upon him, inorder to demonstrate his fidelity to law. When pressed by Crito to escape,Socrates considered the questions which would be put to him by the laws andconstitution of Athens were he to succumb to the temptation to escape thepenalty of the law:
Can you deny that by this act [of escaping] which you are contemplating you
intend, so far as you have the power, to destroy us, the laws, and the whole
778 On natural law, see d’Entrèves, 1970; and Finnis, 1980.

state as well? Do you imagine that a city can continue to exist and not be
turned upside down, if the legal judgments which are pronounced in it haveno force but are nullified and destroyed by private persons? [Crito, inHamilton and Cairns, 1989, p 50b] 
In submitting to death, Socrates was doing nothing other than giving
recognition to the supremacy of law: to the rule of law. An early – and famous– formulation of the dictates of natural law was offered by Cicero (106–43 BC):
True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application,
unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and avertsfrom wrongdoing by its prohibitions. And it does not lay its commands orprohibitions upon good men in vain, though neither have any effect on thewicked. It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repealany part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freedfrom its obligations by Senate or People, and we need not look outsideourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be differentlaws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but oneeternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and for all times, andthere will be one master and one ruler, that is, God, over us all, for He is theauthor of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. [ De Republica, cited
in d’Entrèves, 1970, p 25]
It is from ancient Greek philosophy that natural law enters into Roman law.
From the Corpus Iuris Civilis (AD 534) is derived ius civilis, ius gentium and ius
naturale. Ius civilis denotes the law of the state; ius gentium the law of nations;
and ius naturale ‘a law which expresses a higher and more permanent
standard’. It is the law of nature ( ius naturale ) which corresponds to ‘that
which is always good and equitable’ (d’Entrèves, 1970, p 24).
Christian natural law thought
The scriptures and gospel provided the basis for Christian natural lawthought which developed in the Middle Ages. Natural law was perceived asGod-given, communicated to man by Revelation, and remaining absolutelybinding upon man and unchanging in its content. As a result, the dictates ofnatural law take precedence over man made laws. If the demands of the stateconflict with the laws of God, the obligation to God must prevail.Undoubtedly, the most powerful writing of the Middle Ages comes from StThomas Aquinas (1225–74):
This rational guidance of created things on the part of God ... we can call the
Eternal Law. 
But, of all others, rational creatures are subject to divine Providence in a very
special way; being themselves made participators in Providence itself, in thatthey control their own actions and the actions of others. So they have a share inthe divine reason itself, deriving therefrom a natural inclination to such actionsand ends as are fitting. This participation in the Eternal Law by rationalcreatures is called Natural Law. [ Summa Theologica, cited in d’Entrèves, 1970,
p 43]Chapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
78

The Rule of Law
In the thirteenth century, Bracton proclaimed that ‘the King himself ought not
be subject to man but subject to God and to the law, because the law makeshim King’ (1968–77, f5 b). In 1534, Thomas More (1478–1535) – at the cost ofhis life – refused to recognise Henry VIII as head of the Church, therebyacknowledging the higher duty of obedience to God rather than the rule of histemporal King. 
Natural law and international law
On an international level, natural law thought played a significant role inestablishing the overarching dictates of international law. Grotius (1583–1645),for example, maintained that natural law was discernible by man by virtue ofhis rationality and that a system of natural law would accordingly existindependently of theological perceptions and dictates. In short, natural lawwould exist even if God did not exist. In addition to the insistence onrationalism, the emphasis of natural law at this time started to focus on theindividual, and from this period is discerned the origins of assertions of therights of man. AP d’Entrèves writes that:
... when we read the American or the French Declarations we know that we are
confronted with a complete architecture, about the style of which there can beno mistake. It is a political philosophy based upon a particular notion of theindividual, of society and of their mutual relationship. [1970, p 57]
The idea of social contract 
It is from these beginnings that the theories of social contract and the rights of
man derive. The writings of John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and ThomasPaine are all infused with the doctrine of the inalienability of individualhuman rights – rights which transcend the law of the state, which cannot beoverridden by the state, and which affirm the supremacy of the law of thestate with the important proviso that the law of the state is in compliance withnatural law.
9
Natural law and common law
In the West, the sovereignty of law became inextricably linked with theChristian faith. As seen above, in the thirteenth century, Aquinas asserted theoverriding obligation to God, as opposed to any temporal power. In England,the break with the Roman Catholic Church in 1535 established Henry VIII ashead of the English Church. By assuming supreme power over both spiritualand secular matters, Henry VIII ostensibly broke the logical separation of dutytowards God and the duty owed to the King: obedience to the sovereign nowbecame a religious as well as a political duty. The execution of Sir Thomas
799 Locke (1690), 1977; Rousseau (1762), 1977; Paine (1791, Pt I), 1984.

More in 1534 is illustrative of the King’s reaction to an individual refusal to
recognise the absolute supremacy of the King. Nevertheless, natural lawthought continued to permeate the common law of England before thesettlement of 1688 and the rise of parliamentary sovereignty. 
One of the classic exponents of the demand for the King to be subject to
the law – rather than above it – was Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634), whosestruggle with the King led to his dismissal as Chief Justice in 1616. James I
10
viewed himself as imbued with ultimate power, derived from God under theprerogative. To Coke, laws derived from parliament – comprising the Kingand the three estates of the realm, that is of the Lords Spiritual, the LordsTemporal and the Commons.
11The power of parliament was subject to the
common law, and hence it was that Coke declared:
It appears in our books that in many cases the common law will control the
Acts of Parliament and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void; for whenan Act of Parliament is against the common right or repugnant or impossibleto be performed the common law will control it and adjudge such Act to bevoid.
12
When, in 1608, Coke told the King that the common law protected the King,
the King regarded his speech as traitorous, proclaiming that ‘The Kingprotecteth the law, and not the law the King’.
13Coke’s insistence on the
supremacy of common law was not pure natural law thought, but rather thephilosophical view of the power of legal reasoning deriving from precedent.Indeed it was the King who claimed natural law as being on his side, claimingthat the King was not ‘ignorant of any points [of law] which belong to a Kingto know’.
14Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) favoured the King’s view, seeking to
limit the power of the judges: it was for the King to formulate policy andmake law ( Advancement of Learning (1605), 1951). Coke’s view nevertheless
expresses an idea which is central to natural law thought, namely that there isa higher authority – based on moral judgment – than the law of man. Thecontrol of the prerogative power of the King was to dominate Englishconstitutional development until 1688. With the settlement of 1688 and the Billof Rights 1689, the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy over the King, theprerogative and common law was established. Thereafter, there were to be noassertions of any overriding higher law. The judges bowed to the sovereigntyof parliament.Chapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Rule of Law
THE RULE OF LAW AS POLITICAL THEORY
Liberalism, conservatism and the rule of law 
The rule of law has been subjected to analysis by political theorists of all
persuasions. From the vantage point of the liberal democrat, the rule of lawwill ensure the minimum rules in society to enable man to fulfil his life planaccording to law, but with the minimum interference of law. 
AV Dicey’s writing on the rule of law has had a lasting influence on
constitutional thought. His writing will be considered in detail below,pp91–102. However, Dicey has been criticised by Sir Ivor Jennings for being
motivated, in his writings, by his conservative views. Dicey, in expressing hispreference for clear and stable rules and the minimum of discretion within thelegal process, was, according to Jennings, revealing his conservativepreference for certainty within law rather than concern for the law beingdirected towards social justice which necessarily entails much discretionarypower in the application of broad rules. Jennings (1959b, p 311) writes thatDicey was ‘concerned not with clearing up of the nasty industrial sections ofthe towns, but with the liberty of the subject’. For Jennings, Dicey’s view that‘Englishmen are ruled by the law, and by the law alone’ is ‘not enough’:
The powers of Louis XIV, of Napoleon I, of Hitler, and of Mussolini were
derived from the law, even though that law be only ‘The Leader may do andorder what he pleases’. The doctrine involves some considerable limitation onthe powers of every political authority, except possibly (for this is open todispute) those of a representative legislature. Indeed it contains, as we shallsee, something more, though it is not capable of precise definition. It is anattitude, an expression of liberal and democratic principles, in themselvesvague when it is sought to analyse them, but clear enough in their results.[1959b, p 48]
For Jennings, the doctrine implies, first, that the state as a whole must be
regulated by law; secondly, that the separation of powers is implied withinthe doctrine in order to prevent dictatorship or absolutism. Accordingly, thereare incorporated certain basic requirements
15of the law: equality before the
law; clearly defined police powers; clear general rules adjudicated upon bythe courts; non-retrospectivity in penal statutes; and the strict construction ofpenal statutes. Thirdly, the doctrine incorporates the principle of equality: a
notion which Jennings concedes is as vague as that of the rule of law itself(1959b, p 49). Moreover, and of prime importance, the rule of law implies thenotion of liberty.
8115 Cf Raz, 1979, Chapter 11; and Fuller, 1964.

Marxism and the rule of law
Arguments against a formalistic perception of the rule of law adopted by, inter
alia, Dicey and von Hayek present a formidable target for attack from a
Marxist perspective. Where liberalism insists that law is neutral as betweenpersons and classes and favours maximum liberty for all under the law,Marxism insists that law represents the interests of the powerful withinsociety. Law is an ideological device engaged by those with power to maskthe reality of that power in society, and the correlative powerlessness of theordinary citizen. The rule of law is thus portrayed as a means of subterfuge: itis a mere pretence which hides injustice. Marxism stands in opposition toliberalism and yet, paradoxically, seeks as its end result the complete liberty ofman. Law, from a Marxist perspective, is the reflection of economic powerwithin society, a power which is used to exploit the powerless. Thus it is that,under capitalism, the worker is not rewarded with the full value of his labour:rather, he receives a price for his labour to which is added production costsand profits and together comprise the final price of a product. The laws whichregulate factories and employment terms are all underpinned by theacceptance of the capitalist ideal. Laws which ameliorate the conditions of thepoor do not represent – as appears at first sight – real social justice, but ratherthey represent a calculated means by which the poor are kept compliantwithin their powerlessness.
16Accordingly, the welfare state is but a cynical
mask for maintenance of the status quo which defeats the movement towardsrevolutionary economic and social change:
Far from hastening the revolution, the welfare state undermines efforts to
create working class solidarity. By preventing the fullest development of thematerial degradation of the working class and by providing a limitedimmunity from the vicissitudes of economic crises, a welfare state delays theformation of class consciousness and thus prevents a revolutionary situationfrom arising ... Many of these benefits, and hosts of others, have been won bypolitical struggles aimed at the introduction of legislation. But from theMarxist perspective, they are a mixed blessing. Immediate results are tradedfor long term disabilities in forming a dynamic, working class movement.Welfare legislation obscures the structure of class domination based on therelations of production and reduces the asperity of class antagonisms. [Collins,1982, pp 126–27]
Whether law serves to oppress or merely to uphold the economic status quo –
and there exists dispute on this matter between Marxists themselves – law,from a Marxist perspective, does not serve the interests of all in society. Therule of law thus becomes a grand slogan under which is hidden the reality ofoppression and absence of liberty. The capitalist’s insistence on the rule of lawis seen as a ‘fetishism’ which must be removed along with economicoppression (Cain, 1979, Chapter 5). Only when the capitalist system breaksChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
8216 See Cain and Hunt, 1979.

The Rule of Law
down, and the law which serves it ‘withers away’, will society become truly
free. When that occurs, there will be no need for law and man will achievetrue freedom. 
Professor Joseph Raz and the rule of law
Professor Joseph Raz (1979) approaches the rule of law from a morally neutralbut conceptual standpoint, and asserts that: 
The rule of law is a political ideal which a legal system may lack or may
possess to a greater or lesser degree. That much is common ground. It is also tobe insisted that the rule of law is just one of the virtues which a legal systemmay possess and by which it is to be judged. It is not to be confused withdemocracy, justice, equality (before the law or otherwise), human rights of anykind or respect for persons or for the dignity of man. A non-democratic legalsystem, based on the denial of human rights, on extensive poverty, on racialsegregation, sexual inequalities, and religious persecution may, in principle,conform to the requirements of the rule of law better than any of the legalsystems of the more enlightened Western democracies. [p 211]
Raz acknowledges that his claim will ‘alarm many’, but insists that it presents
‘a coherent view of one important virtue which legal systems should possess’.In seeking to elucidate the ideal of the rule of law, Raz draws the analogybetween the rule of law and a knife. One quality of a good knife is sharpness.However, the quality of sharpness says nothing as to the use to which theknife might be put: beneficial surgery or murder. Sharpness is morallyneutral. And thus it is with the rule of law. However, the purpose of law is toenable citizens to live within the law. Accordingly, there are certain principleswhich must be respected if that goal is to be fulfilled. For the rule of law toexist in society, certain qualities must be present. The law must be clear if it isto be capable of being obeyed. In Merkur Island Shipping Corporation v Laughton
and Others (1983), for example, Lord Donaldson MR stated that:
The efficacy and maintenance of the rule of law, which is the foundation of any
parliamentary democracy, has at least two pre-requisites. First, people mustunderstand that it is in their interests, as well as in that of the community as awhole, that they should live their lives in accordance with the rules and all therules. Secondly, they must know what those rules are ...
Lord Donaldson’s view was endorsed by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords:
Absence of clarity is destructive of the rule of law; it is unfair to those whowish to preserve the rule of law; it encourages those who wish to undermine it.[p 612]
The law must be publicised in order that citizens are aware of its demands;
reasonably stable in order that citizens can plan their lives according to law;prospective so that the law does not require the impossible;
17non-
8317 A principle endorsed in Phillips v Eyre (1870) and Waddington v Miah (1974). See,
however, the War Damage Act 1965 and the War Crimes Act 1991 for illustrations of
parliament’s power to legislate retrospectively.

contradictory for the same reason, and, in addition, the courts must be
accessible and staffed by an independent judiciary. Compliance with each ofthese requirements will indicate that a society respects the rule of law. Tomake such a statement is not to say that the legal system is one which isnecessarily morally ‘good’. As seen in Raz’s illustration with the quality ofsharpness in relation to the knife, the fact of sharpness does not dictate themorality of the purposes to which the knife will be put. It is possible,accordingly, for the rule of law to exist without the legal system necessarilypursuing morally good ends.
Professor Lon Fuller and the rule of law
The writing of Professor Lon Fuller (1964) – who stands in contrast to Raz –may be invoked here in order to develop further this idea. Fuller’s focus is onthe ‘morality of law’. For Fuller, the requirements of law, which aresubstantially the same as those of Raz, lay down the basic minimumrequirements, not just of a system in accordance with the rule of law, but forthe very existence of a system to which he would accord the label ‘legal’.These basic prerequisites form the ‘morality of duty’ or ‘inner morality of law’.These principles provide the basic foundations of a legal system. To draw ananalogy with building construction, failure to lay sound foundations willresult in the edifice resting on an insecure and fragile base. In addition to asecure foundation, for a legal system to be worthy of recognition – and toimpose the duty of obedience upon its members – it must serve the needs ofthe people. Law does not exist in a vacuum separate from the society itregulates. Recognition of this vital characteristic of law demands that the legalsystem be directed towards altruistic, beneficial ends. This is the ‘morality ofaspiration’ towards which each valid legal system must strive. Thus, agovernment must seek to provide the environment in which each citizen mayrealise to his maximum potential the rational plan of life to which he aspires.Society must be free and directed to the good of each of its members. Anygovernment which fails in a material degree to meet these requirements mayfail to deserve the label of a ‘legal system’.
The important point here is that Fuller is quite prepared to argue that a
system of government which contravened the basic requirements of a ‘good’system of law might be recognised as some form of governmental regime butwould not be a government according to law, and hence would not be a ‘legal’system. In order to deserve recognition as a system of law, the system mustrespect the very fundamental moral requirements which Fuller identifies. 
Professor HLA Hart has argued that even a dictatorial regime with no
respect for morality or fundamental rights would be capable of meetingFuller’s requirements (see Hart, 1958). Fuller disputes this, arguing that an evilregime, such as that of Nazi Germany, sooner or later would be compelled topass retrospective law or secret laws in order to pursue its evil objectives.Moreover, Fuller argues that there is an additional quality of morality whichChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
84

The Rule of Law
must be present in a system of law: that the law serves the interests of the
people it governs. Thus, the law must be pursuing altruistic moral ends if it isto have recognition. If it is not, then Fuller would have no difficulty indenying that a ‘legal system’ existed at all.
Raz rejects the linkage between the rule of law and morality and claims
that Fuller’s thesis fails to establish a necessary connection between law andmorals. And yet, for some, the distinction may be a fine one.
Friedrich von Hayek and the rule of law
A further perspective of the rule of law is provided by Friedrich von Hayek.The Road to Serfdom was written against the background of the Second World
War, and expressed von Hayek’s fundamental concern with the prospect ofthe expansion of the state. This von Hayek opposed, other than at a basic levelnecessary to guarantee freedom, and von Hayek describes the rule of law inthe following manner:
... stripped of all technicalities this means that government in all its action is
bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand – rules which make itpossible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercivepowers in given circumstances, and to plan one’s individual affairs on thebasis of this knowledge. [(1944), 1994, p 54]
The idea of a welfare state and the entailed notion of distributive justice which
entails the state operating under discretionary rules in order to provide aminimum standard of living was firmly opposed by von Hayek. The rule oflaw, for von Hayek, should be confined to the provision of clear, certain ruleswhich would enable people to plan their lives in a free society. To require thatpeople should contribute to the less well off in society through a system ofgraduated taxation, coupled with discretion to determine entitlement andquantum of recipients, violated his perceived ideal state. 
Modern expression of many of von Hayek’s ideas is to be found in the
writings of Robert Nozick, a clear and forceful advocate of the ‘minimal state’.Nozick rejects any concept of distributive justice. Instead, he argues forperceptions of justice based on the concept of rights expressed in the name ofentitlements. A state of affairs – and hence a state – will be ‘just’ if it respectsthe principle of entitlement. As Nozick puts it:
Things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements
over them. From the point of view of the historical entitlement conception ofjustice in holdings, those who start afresh to complete ‘to each according his ...’treats objects as if they appeared from nowhere, out of nothing. [1974, p 160]
Justice therefore lies in the recognition of the justice of holdings. If the manner
in which property is acquired is lawful, if the manner in which property istransferred is lawful, the society will be just. To deny the justice of thissituation – from a Nozickian perspective – and to argue for the forcedredistribution of wealth in society, is to defeat the rights of the individualproperty holder.
85

John Rawls’s theory of justice and the rule of law
Opposed to von Hayek and Nozick stands John Rawls, whose Theory of Justice
provides a detailed exposition of, and justification for, the interventionist state
committed to distributive justice. In essence, a society will be ‘just’ if it isorganised according to principles established by all its members in the‘original position’ behind a ‘veil of ignorance’. Suffice to note here that the‘original position’ and ‘veil of ignorance’ relate to a stage of decision makingabout constitutional arrangements wherein the participants know nothing oftheir own personal attributes and wants and little of the society in which theylive. They will accordingly choose principles of justice which are not self-interested but based on maximising the position of those persons (of whomthe decision maker may turn out to be but one) who are in the least enviableposition in society. The principles which they will choose will be, first, thepriority of liberty for all, subject to the need to redistribute goods in society inorder to improve the lot of the ‘worst off’.
The rule of law, according to Rawls, is ‘obviously closely related to liberty’
(1973, p 235). Rawls calls for the ‘regular and impartial administration ofpublic rules’ which is the essence of a just legal system characterised by the‘legitimate expectations’ of the people. Several requirements must be met:rules of law must only command action which is possible; those who enactlaws must do so in good faith; like cases must be treated alike. Echoing Dicey,Rawls states that there is no offence without a law – nulla poena sine lege – and
this requirement in turn demands that laws be known, that they be general,and that penal laws should not be retroactive to the disadvantage of those towhom they apply. Finally, the legal system must respect the dictates ofnatural justice.

‘Law and order’ and the rule of law: the obligation to obey law
An alternative perception of the rule of law may be labelled the ‘law andorder’ model.
19This view emphasises the peaceful settlement of disputes
without recourse to violence, armed force or terrorism. In legal philosophy,the idea of absolute obedience to law is compatible with the analytical,positivist school of thought which dominated much jurisprudential thoughtfrom the nineteenth century until after the Second World War. Positivism isthe antithesis of natural law. The primary quest for positivists is to separatelegal and moral issues: to distinguish between the ‘is’ (that which exists asfact) and the ‘ought’ (that which is desirable). Under positivist theory – whichis primarily concerned to explain law as it exists in fact – where valid lawexists, that is to say law which is accorded validity under the fundamentalconstitutional rule in a state, there is an obligation on each citizen to obey thatChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

19 See Bradley and Ewing, 1997, Chapter 6.

The Rule of Law
law. Hans Kelsen and other legal positivists regard the duty to obey validly
created norms as absolute.20
Taken to its logical conclusion, however, the ‘law and order’ view can lead
to the repression of freedom. By way of illustration, it is a common cry ofpoliticians that a demonstration by, for example, trade union members orstudents, contravenes the ‘rule of law’. In a strict sense, any action whichinvolves protest will almost inevitably violate some legal rule – whether it isthe rule protested against or otherwise.
21Public protest, for example, will
often involve breach of rules against obstruction of the highway, of the policein the execution of their duty, trespass, or criminal damage, even though thoselaws are not the object of the protest. It becomes necessary, therefore, toconsider – albeit in outline – the nature of an individual’s obligation to obeyvalid law. The fundamental question in this regard lies in the extent to whichcitizens should be coerced into obedience to ‘unjust laws’. Is there an absoluteobligation to obey, irrespective of the quality of the law? Is the duty only prima
facie? Is there ever a duty to disobey the law in pursuit of a higher ideal? Each
of these vast and timeless philosophical questions underpins the concept ofthe rule of law. 
Is there a duty to obey law?
To be balanced against the arguments for absolute obedience to law is thelegitimacy of protest within society. Since the time of Aristotle, it has beenargued that the law must be tempered with equity, which dictates thestandards of justice and rightness in society. Law derives its authority fromthe obedience of the people.
22Laws must be directed to the ‘good’, not only to
comply with the dictates of morality, but also for the more pragmatic reasonof ensuring voluntary compliance with law. It may be argued that nowadaysin a responsive, democratic state, any dispute as to the rights of individualsand grievances against government action will be dealt with through theprovided channels of complaint, for example through the individual’sMember of Parliament or through an investigation by the Commissioners forAdministration.
23Alternatively, it may be argued that if many citizens are
commonly aggrieved, the media can be employed to influence governmentand that, ultimately, at least once every five years,
24the electorate can express
its views through the ballot box. None of these avenues, however, may yieldthe desired result, particularly if the aggrieved individual or group is aminority without popular support.

23 See Chapter 26.24 Under the Parliament Act 1911, the maximum life of a parliament is five years. See,
further, Chapter 14.

Is there a right to disobey law?
The question which then arises is whether the individual has a ‘right’ to
disobey the law?25A government true to democratic precepts of
representativeness and fairness must be sensitive to demands for change. If itfails in that regard, it is at least arguable that demands for change, whileentailing technical breaches of the law, should be accommodated within theconstitutional framework. 
In 1848, Henry Thoreau refused to pay taxes to support the slavery laws
and declared that: ‘... the place for a just man in such a community is in jail.’
In the same century, the suffragette movement resorted to unlawful
behaviour in the ultimately successful pursuit of the right to enfranchisement– the right to vote.
26Mahatma Gandhi’s peaceful civil disobedience campaign
led to the independence of India in 1947. The Civil Rights movement in theUnited States in the 1950s, led by Martin Luther King, resulted in reforms ofthe law concerning racial segregation.
27The tide of protest over American
involvement in the Vietnam war had a direct impact on government policyand further raised legal and political interest in civil disobedience. Majorsocial changes of such magnitude would have been impossible withoutrecognition that under certain limited conditions there exists a right oflegitimate protest, however inconvenient and uncomfortable this is forgovernments. The ‘law and order’ model of the rule of law would fail torespect any such ‘right’, and the reaction may be one of repression.
28
However, it is not necessary to look to such major societal changes broughtabout by defiance of law in order to refute the ‘law and order’ model andproclaim some entitlement to dissent. 
John Rawls concedes a right to disobedience in pursuit of changing a
society’s ‘sense of justice’, but confines civil disobedience to peaceful protest.
29
Rawls’s thesis is founded on the notion of social contract. That concept, as hasbeen seen above, involves the mutual recognition, inter alia , of the rights of
citizens and the rights of the state. The extent to which citizens participate inthe law making process is critical to an understanding of the extent to whichthere exists an obligation to obey the law. Participation in the democraticprocess may, however, be used as a means to deny any right to disobey. Thatis to say, it may be argued that democratic participation implies theindividual’s acceptance of all laws within the state. Here it must be consideredwhat it is that citizens consent to when electing a government. It seemsimplausible to argue that we each consent to every action of governmentChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

26 See, inter alia , Kent, 1987.

The Rule of Law
throughout a possible five year term of office, irrespective of its merits.
However, Professor Plamenatz states that when a vote is cast:
... you put yourself by your vote under an obligation to obey whatever
government comes legally to power under the system, and this can properly becalled giving consent. For the purpose of an election is to give authority to thepeople who win it and if you vote, knowing what you are doing and withoutbeing compelled to do it, you voluntarily take part in the process, which givesauthority to those people. [1963, Vol 1, p 239]
This argument surely is contentious and represents a very limited view of the
requirement that a government should have moral authority to govern.Richard Wasserstrom (1963), on the other hand, argues that, by theparticipatory democratic process, a prima facie obligation to obey law is
imposed, but this prima facie duty can be overridden by the demands of
conscience.
Professor JM Finnis offers a contemporary natural law thesis in Natural
Law and Natural Rights . On the relationship between authority, law and the
duty to obey, he writes:
... the ruler has, very strictly speaking, no right to be obeyed; but he has the
authority to give directions and make laws that are morally obligatory and hehas the responsibility of enforcing. He has this authority for the sake of thecommon good ... Therefore, if he uses his authority to make stipulationsagainst the common good, or against any of the basic principles of practicalreasonableness, those stipulations altogether lack the authority they wouldotherwise have by virtue of being his. More precisely, stipulations made forpartisan advantage, or (without emergency justification) in excess of legallydefined authority, or imposing inequitable burdens on their subjects, ordirecting the doing of things that should never be done, simply fail, ofthemselves, to create any moral obligation whatever. [1980, p 359]
Finnis, however, is equivocal about the duty to obey unjust laws and silent as
to the dilemma such laws pose for judges and other officials. There is anobligation to obey the law – not for the sake of ‘being law abiding’ but, rather,in order to – and to the extent to which obedience will – ensure that the ‘justparts of the legal system’ will not be rendered ‘ineffective’ (p 361). Such anapproach follows closely that of St Thomas Aquinas who argued that badlaws do not bind the conscience of man, but that in considering whether ornot to obey such laws, the citizen must weigh up the consequences of hisactions for law as a whole. If, in the act of disobeying immoral law, the citizenundermines the legal system as a whole – which is not morally bad – then theact of civil disobedience itself would be morally culpable ( Summa Theologica, I-
II, q 96). 
The appropriate response of the state to acts of civil disobedience is a
difficult matter. Professor Ronald Dworkin, for example, argues for officialtolerance in the face of dissent and law breaking which is undertaken in
89

pursuit of rights – even where violence is employed.30InTaking Rights
Seriously, Dworkin argues that the state should act with caution in prosecuting
civilly disobedient acts. First, the state should respect the stand taken in thedefence of rights, even if that stand should prove misguided when the matterultimately comes before the Supreme Court for a ruling on the validity of thecontentious legislation. The decision to prosecute should be decided on thebasis of utilitarianism.
31As Dworkin states in A Matter of Principle:
Utilitarianism may be a poor general theory of justice, but it states an excellent
necessary condition for just punishment. Nobody should ever be punishedunless punishing him will do some good on the whole in the long run allthings considered. [1986, p 114]
By prosecuting disobedience to law, the state upholds the positive law and
reinforces it. On the other hand, in prosecuting, the state may reveal thedefects in the law and may be seen to be enforcing that for which there existslittle or no popular support. By way of example, the acquittal of Clive Pontingon charges of breaching section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911
32is
illustrative: the jury refusing to convict despite a clear ruling by the judge as tothe illegality of Ponting’s conduct.
33It may also be argued that by rigid
enforcement the state enhances the moral claims advanced by the civillydisobedient. In part, this was the view adopted by Socrates in submitting tohis fate. He drank the hemlock to show respect to the law and constitution ofAthens, although he must have known that in so doing he would bring thepositive law of the state into disrepute. What he could not foresee was thetimeless example that Athens, in executing Socrates, set for humanity.
34
Is there a duty to disobey?
The converse position must also be considered: if a state violates therequirements of the rule of law, to what extent is it the duty of citizens todisobey the law? Furthermore, what justification, if any, is there for anotherstate or the international community taking action against the ‘guilty’ state?The Nazi regime in Germany provides the most obvious – but not unique –example. On individual duty, Professor Lon Fuller maintained that the citizenis under no obligation to obey unjust law: ‘A mere respect for constitutedauthority must not be confused with fidelity to law.’ Fuller goes further andasserts that an evil regime, which grossly violates the basic precepts ofmorality, is incapable of creating law at all.
35In HLA Hart’s view, this
represents confused thinking on Fuller’s part. His preferred approach is toChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
9030 Dworkin, 1977, Chapters 7 and 8; and see MacGuigan, ‘Obligation and obedience’, in
Pennock and Chapman, 1970.

recognise the validity of Nazi laws – however abhorrent in moral terms – but

36In addition to facilitating clarity about law, this approach enables the
regime to be held to account for its actions. Simply to deny – as does ProfessorFuller – that there was no law during Nazi rule is to remove the basis forinternational legal sanctions.
A V Dicey and the rule of law37
In Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution , AV Dicey offered a
prosaic description of the rule of law. Here, there are none of the ringingproclamations of the theological or political philosophers. Nevertheless,Dicey’s views have continued to exert their influence, despite manychallenges, and it is this influence which requires examination.
Dicey argued that the rule of law – in its practical manifestation – has three
main aspects:
• no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods
except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner
before the ordinary courts of the land. In this sense, the rule of law iscontrasted with every system of government based on the exercise bypersons in authority of wide, arbitrary, or discretionary powers ofconstraint; 
• no man is above the law; every man and woman, whatever be his or her
rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenableto the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals; and
• the general principles of the constitution (as, for example, the right to
personal liberty, or the right of public meeting) are, with us, the result ofjudicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particularcases brought before the courts.
38
Each of these requirements requires examination.
Lack of arbitrariness and retrospectivity
The first element of this analysis is self-explanatory. It requires that no one be
punished except for conduct which represents a clear breach of law.39
Designed to deny to governments any right to make secret or arbitrary laws,or retrospective penal laws, and to limit the discretionary powers ofgovernment, the rule protects the individual. In order to comply fully withthis requirement, laws should be open and accessible, clear and certain. Inpart, this idea ties in with that of the ‘social contract’ and the reciprocalrelationship between the state and the individual. Under social contract
9136 Hart, 1958, p 593 – a view echoing that of St Thomas Aquinas.
37 See Jennings, 1959b, p 54; Heuston, ‘The rule of law’, in 1964a, p 40.

theories, the individual citizen transfers his autonomous individual rights to
the government, to be held by that government on trust. To express the matterdifferently, the citizen owes allegiance to the Crown in return for which he isunder the protection of the Crown.
40The doctrine of allegiance incorporates
the idea of obedience to law – both on the part of the citizen and on the part ofgovernment. Laws which are arbitrary or secret are incapable of justificationon the basis of the mandate of the people and, accordingly, offend against thereciprocal relationship on which constitutional democracy depends. Wherewide discretionary powers are conferred on the executive – whether it be inthe form of granting power to a minister of the Crown to act ‘as he thinks fit’or on civil servants administering the social welfare system – it will beimpossible for the individual to know what rights he or she has. Moreover,the delegation of broad discretionary power – albeit on the authority of thesovereign parliament – renders such power difficult, if not impossible, tochallenge before a court of law or other adjudicatory tribunal.
41
If retrospective penal liability is imposed, the individual is placed in the
position where his conduct was lawful at the time of his action but,subsequently, he is held responsible as if his conduct was then unlawful. Anexamination and evaluation of the relevance of this first proposition entailsdrawing on relevant illustrations from both statute and case law. For example,the courts construe penal statutes narrowly and will be slow to find thatparliament intended to impose retrospective liability. So important is theconcept of mens rea in the criminal law
42that it will rarely be appropriate for a
prosecution to succeed in its absence, and it is for this reason that the courtsemploy the presumption of statutory interpretation against retrospectivity:
Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than this – that a
retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existingright or obligation, otherwise than as regards matters of procedure, unless thateffect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of theenactment. If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable ofeither interpretation, it ought to be construed as prospective only.
43
In Waddington v Miah (1974), the House of Lords interpreted the Immigration
Act 1971 in a manner which denied retrospective effect in relation to criminal
offences, using, as an aid to construction, Article 7 of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, which guarantees freedom fromretrospectivity. Nonetheless, the presumption will not be available whereparliament expressly provides for retrospectivity, as, for example, in the WarDamage Act 1965 and the War Crimes Act 1991.

Advocate (1965), where the House of Lords had awarded compensation to beChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

44 See Chapter 7.

The Rule of Law
paid for the destruction of oil installations in wartime, the government
speedily introduced legislation nullifying the effect of the decision under theWar Damage Act 1965. This case demonstrates clearly the subordination ofthe judiciary to parliamentary supremacy and the limits thereby imposed onthe judges’ capacity to uphold rights. 
Notwithstanding the general prohibition against retrospectivity, there may
be instances where a decision which imposes, for example, criminal liabilitymay be upheld by the courts. For example, until 1990, there existed a timehonoured exemption from the law of rape for husbands who ‘raped’ theirwives. In the case of R v R (1991), however, the House of Lords upheld the
conviction of a husband for the rape of his wife, arguing that the rule againstliability for rape within marriage was anachronistic. In a challenge to thisdecision under the European Convention on Human Rights, on the basis thatit infringed Article 7 of the Convention, which makes retrospectivityunlawful, the Court of Human Rights ruled that the sweeping away ofhusbands’ immunity from criminal prosecution and conviction for raperepresented an evolution towards greater equality between the sexes and wasconsistent with that equality.
45
Equality before the law: government under the law
Dicey’s second limb emphasises the notion that government itself is subject tolaw and that everyone, irrespective of rank, whether official or individual,shall be subject to the law,
46and subject to the same courts. Dicey viewed the
French system of special courts to deal with complaints against government asabhorrent, fearing that specially constituted courts would unduly favour thegovernment over the citizen. Dicey has often been interpreted as requiringthat there be actual equality in terms of legal rights, powers and capacities.Such an interpretation is, however, misguided. The idea of equality before thelaw, irrespective of status, is subject to so many exceptions ‘that the statementis of doubtful value’.
47In so far as equal powers are concerned, it must be
recognised that the police have powers over and above the citizen,48that
ministers have power to enact delegated legislation (but subject toparliamentary approval), that the Crown enjoys immunities under the law,that the government acting in the name of the Crown may exerciseprerogative powers which may defeat the rights of individuals,
49that
Members of Parliament have immunity from the law of defamation under theprivileges of parliament,
50and that diplomats enjoy immunities not available

to citizens. And, as Sir Ivor Jennings points out, no two citizens are entirely
equal: 
... pawnbrokers, money lenders, landlords, drivers of motor cars, married
women, and indeed most other classes have special rights and duties. [1959b,Appendix II, p 311]
Against this catalogue, which is not exhaustive, must be set the extent to
which government and public officials are subject to law in the sense of beingaccountable for their actions before the ordinary courts, for this, indeed, wasDicey’s real argument. The doctrine acknowledges the need of a consistentapplication of the law irrespective of status. No one is immune from criminalprosecution (other than the monarch: ‘Against the King law has no coercivepower’).
51Official accountability to law is one of the foundations of the rule of
law. Following a detailed analysis of Dicey’s writing, Professor Jeffrey Jowellconcludes that: 
... its ghost has refused to rest. It rises still to haunt a minister who publishes
‘guidelines’ that cut across the powers of the statute under which he operates,the minister who penalises local authorities for overspending without givingthem a fair hearing, a government department which decides in accordancewith a secret code not available to the public, or a Prime Minister who seeks todeprive civil servants of their rights to remain members of a trade union. [‘Therule of law today’, in Jowell and Oliver, 1989, p 23. See, now, 2000 edn,Chapter 1]
Sir Ivor Jennings criticises Dicey’s emphasis on government according to law
on the basis that it is too narrow an interpretation: 
... it is a small point upon which to base a doctrine called by the magnificent
name of ‘rule of law’, particularly when it is generally used in a very differentsense. [1959b, p 312]
TRS Allan subjects Dicey’s analysis to detailed scrutiny which is devoid of the
dismissiveness of de Smith and Brazier or the scepticism of Sir Ivor Jennings,and focuses on Dicey’s second principle: that of equality before the law.
52
Allan seeks a solution to the apparent paradox presented by Dicey’s insistencethat both parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law comprise thefundamental doctrines of the constitution – given that the former concept isinherently capable of damaging the latter. Towards this end, Allan presents awealth of evidence directed to establishing a middle way between theformalism of the ‘principle of legality’ and the vagueness of the ‘broadpolitical ideal’. In other words, what is sought is an explanation of the meansby which the power of sovereignty is restrained or restricted withoutexpounding a ‘complete social philosophy’ (1985a, p 114). The key to such anunderstanding, according to Allan, lies in the role of the judiciary and in anacceptance that it is the judges who – in applying the ‘juristic principle’ of theChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
9451 Maitland, 1908, p 100.
52 Allan, 1985a; 1993, Chapter 2; 2001.

The Rule of Law
rule of law – limit the power of parliament. To summarise, Allan draws on the
principles of statutory interpretation (non-retrospectivity, clarity, mens rea in
penal statutes, etc); on the independence of the judiciary as ensured by theseparation of powers; on the right of access to the courts for all citizens; andon the judiciary’s reluctance for the jurisdiction of judicial review to belimited. By these and other means, Allan seeks to demonstrate that:
... the rule of law strengthens democracy by ensuring that government
operates only within rules adopted or sanctioned by Parliament ...
and that:
The constitutional principle of the rule of law serves, however, to bridge thegap between the legal doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and the politicaldoctrine of the sovereignty of the people. In interpreting statutes in conformity,so far as possible, with general notions of fairness and justice – in seeking toapply those common standards of morality which are taken for granted in thecommunity – the judge respects the natural expectations of the citizen.
The rule of law therefore assists in preventing the subversion of the political
sovereignty of the people by manipulation of the legal sovereignty ofParliament. [1985a, p 130]
In order to evaluate such contrasting views as those expressed above,
consideration of some evidence becomes necessary. 
Judicial review
Actions for judicial review of administrative action, employing concepts ofintra and ultra vires and the rules of natural justice, ensure that the executive
acts within the law. Judicial review – in its infancy in Dicey’s time – representsthe means by which the sovereignty of parliament is upheld and the rule oflaw applied. Dicey, writing in 1915, analysed the significance of Board of
Education v Rice (1911) and Local Government Board v Arlidge (1915), claiming
that:
... each case finally lays down, as far as the courts of England are concerned, a
clear and distinct principle by which any department of the government, suchfor example as the Board of Education, must be guarded in the exercise ofpowers conferred upon it by statute.
53
The means by which, and grounds upon which, judicial review may be
granted are considered in Chapters 24 and 25. It is sufficient for currentpurposes to note that judicial review is the means by which administrativeauthorities – whether ministers of the Crown, government departments, localauthorities or others with law making and administrative powers – areconfined by the courts within the powers granted to them by parliament. It isfor a court to determine – following the granting of an application for judicialreview – whether the body in question has acted intra vires or ultra vires (that
9553 Dicey (1898), 1959, Appendix 2, p 493. On these cases, see, further, Chapter 25.

is, inside or outside its powers). Judicial review is confined to matters of
public, rather than private law. Thus, where a relationship between anaggrieved citizen and a body is based, for example, on the law of contract,judicial review will not lie.
54It is also necessary – in the interests of good
administration – that aggrieved individuals have ‘sufficient interest’ – or locus
standi – in the matter to bring it to court.55There are numerous grounds on
which judicial review may be sought. By way of illustration, a body may actultra vires if it uses its powers for the wrong purpose,
56or if it abuses its
powers,57or if it adopts a policy which is so rigid that it fails to exercise a
discretion with which it has been invested.58The law imposes standards of
reasonableness upon administrative bodies, and failure to act in a reasonablemanner may cause a body to act ultra vires.
59A body may act ultra vires if it is
conferred with delegated powers but delegates them further to another.60
Statute may require that administrators adopt particular procedures in theexercise of these powers: should they not do so, and the procedures arejudicially deemed to be ‘mandatory’ (compulsory) rather than ‘directory’(advisory), a body will be held to be acting ultra vires. If a public body under a
duty to act fails to act at all, the court can order it to do so by a mandatoryorder. The rules of natural justice must also be observed in decision making:where an individual has a right or interest at stake because of anadministrative decision, he is entitled to fair treatment.
61All of these grounds
for review have been rationalised by the House of Lords into three principalcategories: irrationality, illegality and procedural impropriety.
62The powers
of the court can only be exercised over a matter which it is competent todetermine. This introduces the concept of justiciability,
63and it is this latter
doctrine which most particularly undermines the concept of the rule of law. 
In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service , the House of
Lords identified the categories of decision which would be immune fromjudicial review – that is to say – non-justiciable. Amongst these – and the list isnot exhaustive – are the making of treaties, the dissolution of parliament, theappointment of ministers, declarations of war and peace, and matters relatingto the granting of honours. What unites these categories is the fact that eachChapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Rule of Law
involves matters of high policy which is most appropriately determined – in
the eyes of the judiciary – not by the courts but by the executive. Where thisapplies, it may be said that the rule of law is undermined by respect for thedoctrine of the separation of powers: an ironic consequence.
The doctrine of judicial review nevertheless represents a bedrock for the
application of the rule of law, keeping those with law making anddiscretionary powers within the law. From Entick v Carrington (1765) to R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades’ Union and Others(1993) ,wherein Kenneth Baker, the Home Secretary, was held to be acting
ultra vires when attempting to introduce a new tariff for compensation under
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme under the royal prerogativerather than under power conferred by statute, the principle is established andreiterated.
The legal process
For the rule of law to be respected and applied, the legal process – civil andcriminal – must exhibit certain features. These features may be categorised asaccessibility and procedural fairness.
Accessibility 
The law must be accessible to all if rights are to be enforced. Accordingly,there must not only exist a system of courts available locally but the cost ofhaving recourse to the courts must be such that there is real – rather thansymbolic – access to the courts. For the law to be attainable, adequate legaladvice and assistance must be provided at a cost affordable by all.
64The cost
of litigation in the United Kingdom is high. The cost of counsel defending in acriminal trial is high. The statutory legal aid scheme is designed to mitigatethe cost of access to the law by providing financial assistance to defendantsand litigants who are unable to meet the full costs of a legal action.
65The
principles put forward by the Royal Commission on Legal Services were that:
Financial assistance out of public funds should be available for every
individual (not corporations) who, without it, would suffer an undue financialburden in properly pursuing or defending his or her legal rights;
All those who receive legal services are entitled to expect the same standard of
legal service irrespective of their personal circumstances.
66
The legal aid scheme, however, fell far short of these objectives. In 1990, the
proportion of eligible adults had decreased to 56 per cent, with 22 per centbeing eligible for free legal aid and 34 per cent eligible but subject to a

contribution. As with civil legal aid, the criminal legal aid scheme employs the
merits and means tests. In terms of merits, the test is whether it is ‘in theinterests of justice’ for aid to be granted.
67The means test is administered by
the court clerks, and may result in a contribution being ordered, although, in1990, of 510,000 legal aid applications granted by magistrates, only 47,000(nine per cent) had contribution orders attached.
68Successive governments
strive to curtail legal aid.69
The right to a fair trial is protected under Article 6 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, and includes the right of the citizen: 
... to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing
or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it freewhen the interests of justice so require.
In Granger v United Kingdom (1990), the defendant had been denied further
legal aid to pursue an appeal against conviction. Granger, unable to afford
legal representation, acted in person. Representing the Crown were seniorgovernment counsel. On an application under the Convention, Grangeralleged that he had been denied the protection of law. The Court of HumanRights ruled that the denial of legal aid infringed Granger’s rights.
Procedural fairness
Justice and the rule of law demand that, in the conduct of legal proceedings,procedural fairness be observed. Subsumed within this requirement are manysubsidiary conditions. The judge must be impartial: nemo iudex in sua causa .
Where jurors are involved, they, too, must be free from bias. In addition,jurors should be reasonably representative of the society they serve. Evidencegathered by the police must be acquired by lawful means. The evidenceadmitted into court must be both of an admissible nature and fairly presented.The proceedings should be conducted in such a manner as to be intelligible tothe parties, witnesses and jurors.
70
The jury
The precise origins of trial by jury in its modern form are shrouded in mist.71
It is thought that by the end of the fifteenth century, the jury, as triers of fact,was established in what today would be a recognisable form. Trial by jury forserious criminal offences, and in civil cases where defamation, maliciousprosecution, false imprisonment and allegations of fraud are at issue,

requirement.

The Rule of Law
regarded as the ‘bulwark of our liberties’.73The decision of the jury is
regarded as conclusive and unimpeachable. Criticisms have long been made
of the lack of representativeness of the jury. Several factors militate againstrepresentativeness: the accuracy of the electoral register from which jurors areselected; the relative lack of randomness in jury selection; the vetting ofjurors;
74and challenges to members of the jury. Moreover, a wide range of
persons are either ineligible for jury service, or disqualified from sitting ormay be excused from jury service.
75When a jury is summoned, the presence
of a juror may be challenged ‘for cause’ – that is, where some fact relating tothe juror is known and gives rise to a challenge. Little is known about theindividual juror – only the names and addresses are given.
76This relative
anonymity of jurors contrasts starkly with the position in the United States ofAmerica, where the selection of a jury entails a prolonged inquiry into thelives and attitudes of prospective jurors. While the process is protracted,
77it is
designed to ensure that the jury ultimately selected will be one free from biasin relation to the defendant. In the United Kingdom, a person may be excusedfrom service on the basis of personal knowledge of the case, bias, personalhardship or conscientious objection to jury service. A juror should not beexcused on general grounds such as race, religion, political beliefs oroccupation.
78
Evidence
For the rule of law to be observed, it is of central importance that the evidencebefore the court be both complete and reliable. Contravention of thisrequirement undermines the concept of a fair trial. Subsumed within thisquestion is the complex and controversial matter of the manner in whichevidence is obtained and the question of admissibility. While the Police andCriminal Evidence Act 1984
79went some way to improving the safeguards for
the accused and was introduced, in part, to rectify deficiencies which hadcome to light,
80the cases of the Birmingham Six,81the Guildford Four and the
Maguire Seven82illustrated the deficiencies in the criminal justice system. In
each of these cases, the defendants had served long terms of imprisonment foralleged Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorist acts. In each case, the evidencerelied upon was unreliable. Their convictions were quashed by the Court of

Appeal following years of campaigning by relatives and friends for a review

At common law, a confession which is improperly obtained is
inadmissible.
83The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 places this rule on
a statutory basis, providing that if a confession has been obtained ‘byoppression’, the court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidenceunless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confession – even if true –has not been obtained improperly (section 76).
Whereas the rules on the admissibility of improperly obtained confessions
are relatively clear, the admissibility of other evidence obtained by eitherdubious or unlawful means has proved less clear and less satisfactory. Until1979, the judges exercised their discretion as to whether or not evidenceimproperly acquired would be admissible.
84However, in R v Sang (1979), the
House of Lords ruled that no discretion existed to exclude evidence whichhad been obtained by unlawful or improper means. The only basis on whichevidence could be excluded would be where the effect of admitting it wouldprove unduly ‘prejudicial’ to the defence or ‘unfair’ to admit it. The fact thatthe evidence was unlawfully acquired does not amount to ‘unfairness’ per
se.
85This position compares unfavourably with that pertaining in the United
States, where evidence improperly obtained is excluded,86and that in
Australia, where such evidence is inadmissible unless the judge is satisfiedthat there is some special reason why the impropriety should be excused.
The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure
87confirmed the test
propounded in R v Sang. However, the government rejected the
Commission’s view, and the position as to admissibility of such evidence isnow governed by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,which provides that the court may refuse to allow evidence if:
... it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including
the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of theevidence would have such adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedingsthat the court ought not to admit it.
Professor Michael Zander describes the effect of section 78 as ‘nothing less
than startling’ (1993, p 414). He records that, from 1986 (when the Act cameinto force) until early 1991:
… there had been close to a hundred reported decisions in which the courts
had given rulings under section 78 and that in the ‘great majority’ of thesecases the decision had been in favour of the accused. Chapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Rule of Law
Evaluation of Dicey’s ‘equality before the law’
The evidence for the notion of equality before the law is neither clear nor
uncontentious. As with so much of the constitution, there remains room fordoubt and argument. Nevertheless, it is submitted that there exists sufficientevidence to suggest that Dicey’s approach remains a fruitful avenue forinquiry and exploration. To dismiss – as some writers do – this aspect ofDicey’s exposition of the rule of law, is to deprive the student of theconstitution of a valuable tool for analysis. 
The protection of rights under common law
The third limb of Dicey’s description of the rule of law reveals his preferencefor common law protection of human rights over and above a speciallyformulated code of rights, thus demonstrating a faith in the judiciary which isnot sustainable nowadays. Evaluation of this aspect of the definition mustawait analysis of the Human Rights Act 1998 in Chapter 19 and the scope ofthe protection which it gives to individual citizens.
The Human Rights Act 1998 for the first time ‘incorporates’ rights
protected under the European Convention on Human Rights into domesticlaw. Accordingly, citizens no longer have to undertake the lengthy process ofapplying to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but are able to seek aremedy in the domestic courts. The method of incorporation adopted,however, falls far short of enabling the judges to invalidate or set asidedomestic legislation. Instead, the judges of the higher courts are empoweredto make ‘declarations of incompatibility’ with Convention rights. Once such adeclaration has been made, it remains for parliament to approve anamendment to the law. As a result, the Human Rights Act, far from elevatingindividual rights proclaimed in the Convention to a higher status than statute,preserves parliament’s sovereign law making and amending power, and alsomaintains the separation of powers. 
Notwithstanding the Act’s status, the rule of law is undoubtedly
buttressed by the Act: every public body – by no means a simple concept
88–
is required to comply with Convention rights, and to fail to do so is to actunlawfully save where there is no available alternative form of action becauseof the requirements of primary legislation (section 6). To support rightsfurther, the Act requires that judges interpret primary and secondarylegislation ‘so far as it is possible to do so in a manner compatible withConvention requirements’ (section 3(1)). Coming into effect in Scotland in1999 and in England in 2000, the impact of the Act has been considerable.
10188 For discussion see Chapter 19, but note here that s 6(3)(a) and (b) includes courts and
tribunals, and ‘any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,
but does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions inconnection with proceedings in Parliament’.

However, a flavour of the breadth of the impact is gleaned from the following.
The Act has spawned challenges to the criminal justice system, in relation to:
• the independence and impartiality of temporary judicial appointments; • the right not to incriminate oneself; 
• the rights of prisoners to privacy in relation to confidential correspondence
with legal advisers; 
• rights of prisoners in relation to the conditions of detention; 
• delays between parole board hearings for the consideration of release.
Mental patients have challenged successfully the burden of proof required
before they can be considered for release; and the length of delay indetermining their status. The Act has also had an impact on family law, withchildren who have been made subject to secure accommodation ordersdemanding that they be allowed to put their case at hearings, and absentparents challenging decisions as to contact with children. Former soldiersrequired to give evidence in Northern Ireland in the course of the BloodySunday inquiry have successfully argued that the risk to their lives amountsto a prospective violation of their right to life.
Even in its infancy, the Human Rights Act is having the effect of requiring
all public bodies to scrutinise their procedures for Convention compliance, orto face legal action.
The rule of law in international dimension
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, publishedin 1948, declares that:
It is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to
rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should beprotected by the rule of law.
The European Convention also recognises the concept of the rule of law. The
preamble states that:
The governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a
common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law ...have agreed as follows ...
On an international level, the rule of law is also advanced by the International
Commission of Jurists, which strives to uphold and improve the rule of lawwithin the legal systems of its members. The Declaration of Delhi ,issued
under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists, affirms the ruleof law and its value in promoting the protection of civil and political rightsand linked such rights with the development and protection of social andeconomic rights. The Congress of the International Commission of Jurists metin 1959 in order to ‘clarify and formulate a supranational concept of the rule oflaw’.
89The Declaration of Delhi 1959 recognised that:Chapter 4: Constitutional and Administrative Law
10289 Marsh, ‘The rule of law as a supranational concept’, in Guest, 1961, p 240, and Marsh,
1959.

The Rule of Law
... the rule of law is a dynamic concept for the expansion and fulfilment of
which jurists are primarily responsible and which should be employed notonly to safeguard and advance the civil and political rights of the individual ina free society, but also to establish social, economic, educational and culturalconditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realised...
Accordingly, clause I of the report of the committee stipulates that:
The function of the legislature in a free society under the rule of law is to createand maintain the conditions which will uphold the dignity of man as anindividual. This dignity requires not only the recognition of his civil andpolitical rights but also the establishment of the social, economic, educationaland cultural conditions which are essential to the full development of hispersonality.
90
Such aspirational statements recognise the need for the economic foundations
to be such that the dignity of man can be a reality in society. It is meaninglessto speak of the rule of law as insisting on decent, or even minimal, standardsof living within the context of poverty and disease. In order to secure any suchstandards, a sufficient level of economic wealth must be achieved. Even wheresuch standards do exist, there will remain resistances to any formulation ofsocial and economic rights as enforceable positive legal rights, for suchformulations require the allocation of resources within society. Whereasgovernments may be willing – indeed obliged – to respect civil and politicalrights in a democracy, the protection of such rights generally will be effectedwithout significant national resource implications. The protection of freedoms,such as freedom of speech and association, requires no more than a restrainton government. The protection of social and economic rights requires positiveaction, at a high cost.
91
CONCLUSION
The rule of law – in its many guises – represents a challenge to state authorityand power, demanding that powers both be granted legitimately and thattheir exercise is according to law. ‘According to law’ means both according tothe legal rules and something over and above purely formal legality and
imputes the concepts of legitimacy and constitutionality. In its turn, legitimacy
implies rightness or morality of law. The law is not autonomous but rests on the
support of those it governs. The law is the servant of the sense of rightness inthe community, and whilst the rule of law places law above every individual –irrespective of rank and station – it remains, paradoxically, subject to theultimate judgment of the people.

CHAPTER 5
The separation of powers, together with the rule of law and parliamentary
sovereignty, runs like a thread throughout the constitution of the UnitedKingdom. It is a doctrine which is fundamental to the organisation of a state –and to the concept of constitutionalism – in so far as it prescribes theappropriate allocation of powers, and the limits of those powers, to differinginstitutions. The concept has played a major role in the formation ofconstitutions. The extent to which powers can be, and should be, separate anddistinct was a central feature in formulating, for example, both the Americanand French revolutionary constitutions. In any state, three essential bodiesexist: the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. It is the relationshipbetween these bodies which must be evaluated against the backcloth of theprinciple. The essence of the doctrine is that there should be, ideally, a cleardemarcation in function between the legislature, executive and judiciary inorder that none should have excessive power and that there should be in placea system of checks and balances between the institutions. However, as will beseen, there are significant departures from the pure doctrine under the UnitedKingdom’s constitution, and it must be conceded that, while the doctrine isaccorded respect, it is by no means absolute. 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
The identification of the three elements of the constitution derives fromAristotle (384–322 BC). In The Politics, Aristotle proclaimed that:
There are three elements in each constitution in respect of which every serious
lawgiver must look for what is advantageous to it; if these are well arranged,the constitution is bound to be well arranged, and the differences inconstitutions are bound to correspond to the differences between each of theseelements. The three are, first, the deliberative, which discusses everything ofcommon importance; second, the officials; and third, the judicial element. [Bkiv, xiv, 1297b35]
The constitutional seeds of the doctrine were thus sown early, reflecting the
need for government according to and under the law, a requirementencouraged by some degree of a separation of functions between theinstitutions of the state.
The constitutional historian FW Maitland traces the separation of powers
in England to the reign of Edward I (1272–1307): 
In Edward’s day all becomes definite – there is the Parliament of the three
estates, there is the King’s Council, there are the well known courts of law.[1908, p 20]
105THE SEPARATION OF POWERS

Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law
106Viscount Henry St John Bolingbroke (1678–1751), in Remarks on the History of
England, advanced the idea of separation of powers. Bolingbroke was
concerned with the necessary balance of powers within a constitution, arguing
that the protection of liberty and security within the state depended uponachieving and maintaining an equilibrium between the Crown, parliamentand the people. Addressing the respective powers of the King and parliament,Bolingbroke observed that:
Since this division of power, and these different privileges constitute and
maintain our government, it follows that the confusion of them tends todestroy it. This proposition is therefore true; that, in a constitution like ours,the safety of the whole depends on the balance of the parts. [1748, pp 80–83]
Baron Montesquieu (1689–1755, living in England from 1729–31) stressed the
importance of the independence of the judiciary in De l’Esprit des Lois (1748):
When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in
the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty ... Again, there is noliberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative andexecutive. If it were joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subjectwould be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would then be thelegislator. If it were joined to the executive power, the judge might behave withviolence and oppression. There would be an end to everything, if the sameman, or the same body, whether of the nobles or the people, were to exercisethose three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing public affairs, andthat of trying crimes or individual causes.
Here is the clearest expression of the demand for a separation of functions. It
has been remarked that Montesquieu’s observations on the English
constitution were inaccurate at the time, representing more a description of anidealised state than reality.
1Moreover, it should not be assumed that
Montesquieu’s preferred arrangement of a pure separation of powers isuncontroversial. Throughout history, there has been exhibited a tensionbetween the doctrine of separation of powers and the need for balancedgovernment – an arrangement depending more on checks and balances withinthe system (as emphasised by Bolingbroke) than on a formalistic separation ofpowers. Sir Ivor Jennings has interpreted Montesquieu’s words to mean notthat the legislature and the executive should have no influence over the other,but rather that neither should exercise the power of the other.
2Sir William
Blackstone, a disciple of Montesquieu, adopted and adapted Montesquieu’sstrict doctrine, reworking his central idea to incorporate the theory of mixedgovernment. While it was of central importance to Blackstone that, forexample, the executive and legislature should be sufficiently separate to avoid‘tyranny’, he nevertheless viewed their total separation as potentially leadingto dominance of the executive by the legislature.
3Thus, partial separation of

The Separation of Powers
powers was required to achieve a mixed and balanced constitutional
structure. 
THE CONTEMPORARY DOCTRINE
The separation of powers doctrine does not insist that there should be threeinstitutions of government each operating in isolation from each other.Indeed, such an arrangement would be unworkable, particularly under aconstitution dominated by the sovereignty of parliament. Under such anarrangement, it is essential that there be a sufficient interplay between eachinstitution of the state. For example, it is for the executive, for the most part, topropose legislation for parliament’s approval. Once passed into law, Acts ofParliament are upheld by the judiciary. A complete separation of the threeinstitutions could result in legal and constitutional deadlock. Rather than apure separation of powers, the concept insists that the primary functions ofthe state should be allocated clearly and that there should be checks to ensurethat no institution encroaches significantly upon the function of the other. Ifhypothetical constitutional arrangements within a state are considered, arange of possibilities exists:
(a) absolute power residing in one person or body exercising executive,
legislative and judicial powers: no separation of powers;
(b) power being diffused between three separate bodies exercising separate
functions with no overlaps in function or personnel: pure separation of
powers; and
(c) powers and personnel being largely – but not totally – separated with
checks and balances in the system to prevent abuse: mixed governmentand weak separation of powers. 
It is to this third category that the constitution of the United Kingdom most
clearly subscribes.
Geoffrey Marshall states that the phrase ‘separation of powers’ is ‘one of
the most confusing in the vocabulary of political and constitutional thought’.In part, as Marshall explains (1971, p 97), this is because it has been used ‘withvarying implication’ by historians and political scientists, and because theconcept manifests itself in so many arenas: ‘... judicial independence,delegation of legislative powers, executive responsibility to legislatures,judicial review, and constitutionality of arbitral bodies exercising mixedfunctions.’
DEFINING THE INSTITUTIONS
The executive
The executive may be defined as that branch of the state which formulatespolicy and is responsible for its execution. In formal terms, the sovereign is thehead of the executive. The Prime Minister, Cabinet and other ministers, for the
107

most part, are elected Members of Parliament.4In addition, the Civil Service,
local authorities, police and armed forces, constitute the executive in practical
terms.
The legislature
The Queen in Parliament is the sovereign law making body within the UnitedKingdom. Formally expressed, parliament comprises the Queen, House ofLords and House of Commons. All Bills
5must be passed by each House and
receive the royal assent. 
Parliament is bicameral, that is to say there are two chambers, each
exercising a legislative role – although not having equal powers – and eachplaying a part in ensuring the accountability of the government. By way ofintroduction, it should be noted that membership of the House of Lords is notsecured by election and is accordingly not accountable in any direct sense tothe electorate. The House of Commons is directly elected, and a parliamentaryterm is limited under the Parliament Act 1911 to a maximum of five years. Inpractice, the average life of a parliament is between three and four years. TheHouse is made up of the majority party: the political party which secures thehighest number of seats at the election, which will form the government. Thehead of that party will be invited by the Queen to take office as PrimeMinister. In turn, it is for the Prime Minister to select his or her Cabinet. Theopposition parties
6comprise the remainder of the now 659 Members of
Parliament.7The official Opposition is the party which represents the second
largest party in terms of elected members. In principle, the role of the officialOpposition is to act as a government in waiting, ready at any time to takeoffice should the government seek a dissolution of parliament.
8
The judiciary
The judiciary is that branch of the state which adjudicates upon conflicts
between state institutions, between state and individual, and betweenindividuals. The judiciary is independent of both parliament and theexecutive. It is the feature of judicial independence which is of primeimportance both in relation to government according to law and in theprotection of liberty of the citizen against the executive. As Blackstoneobserved in his Commentaries:
... in this distinct and separate existence of the judicial power in a peculiar body
of men, nominated indeed, but not removable at pleasure by the Crown,Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law
1084 Note that some ministers are drawn from the unelected House of Lords. See, further,

The Separation of Powers
consists one main preservative of the public liberty which cannot subsist long
in any state unless the administration of common justice be in some degreeseparated both from the legislative and from the executive power [Vol 1,p 204].
It is apparent, however, that, whilst a high degree of judicial independence is
secured under the constitution, there are several aspects of the judicialfunction which reveal an overlap between the judiciary, parliament and theexecutive. The first of these lies in the office of Lord Chancellor.
The office of Lord Chancellor9
It is the office of Lord Chancellor which is most frequently cited as being aviolation of the doctrine of separation of powers. It is certainly a most notableexception to that doctrine. The office derives from the Norman Conquestwhen the King’s secretary became known as the royal ‘chancellor’. The firstChancellor is recorded in 1068. In the Middle Ages, the primary role of theChancellor was to preside over parliament. From the fourteenth century, hisfunctions have been both parliamentary and judicial, in the latter rolepresiding over the Court of Chancery until 1875.
10A glance at the several
roles he undertakes reveals why the office is claimed to breach the doctrine ofseparation of powers. 
Functions in relation to the courts
The Lord Chancellor is head of the judiciary and is formally recognised asPresident of the Supreme Court under the Supreme Court Act 1981. Theadministration of the Supreme Court (Court of Appeal, High Court andCrown Courts) and the county courts is the responsibility of the LordChancellor.
11Magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. High Court
judges, circuit judges and recorders are appointed by the Crown on hisadvice.
12The dismissal of magistrates,13without showing cause, and circuit
judges for incapacity and misbehaviour is within the Lord Chancellor’spowers.
14
The Lord Chancellor has responsibility for the court service,15legal aid
and advice schemes, the Land Registry16and the Public Records Office.17He
also presides over the Court of Protection.18
1099 See, inter alia, Heuston, 1964b and 1987; Bradney, 1989; Drewry, 1972. The title Lord
Chancellor is first recorded in 1461.

16 Land Registry Act 1862.
17 Public Records Act 1958.
18 Mental Health Act 1959.

Law reform
The Lord Chancellor works closely with the Law Commission of England and
Wales (note: not the Scottish Law Commission) established by the LawCommissions Act 1965. The task of the Law Commission is to:
... take and keep under review all the law with which [it is] concerned with a
view to its systematic development and reform, including in particular thecodification of such law, the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsoleteand unnecessary enactments, the reduction of the number of separateenactments and generally the simplification and modernisation of the law.[Law Commissions Act 1965, section 3(1)]
The Lord Chancellor may refer matters to the Law Commission for
investigation, or the Commission may investigate issues of its own motion. 
Member of the executive
The Lord Chancellor is a member of the executive arm of government. He is asenior member of Cabinet and, as such, may be dismissed by the PrimeMinister.
19It is perhaps this feature of the Lord Chancellor’s office which
gives rise to the greatest disquiet when evaluated against the doctrine of theseparation of powers, for the obvious impression is given that there is tooclose an association between the head of the judiciary and the central body ofthe executive – the Cabinet. Nevertheless, there is some justification for thisarrangement. Lord Chancellor Birkenhead (1872–1930), for example, defendedthe link between the head of the judiciary and the Cabinet in 1922:
... it is difficult to believe that there is no necessity for the existence of such a
personality, imbued on the one hand with legal ideas and habits of thought,and aware on the other of the problems which engage the attention of theexecutive government. In the absence of such a person, the judiciary and theexecutive are likely enough to drift asunder to the point of a violent separation,followed by a still more violent and disastrous collision. [1922, Chapter 4]
More recently, Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor 1979 and 1987, argued that it
is vital that:
... the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law should be defended
inside the Cabinet as well as in Parliament. The Lord Chancellor must be, andmust be seen to be, a loyal colleague, not seeking to dodge responsibility forcontroversial policies, and prepared to give to Parliament a justification for hisown acts of administration. [1975]
Equally strong support for this constitutionally unusual relationship between
the judiciary and the executive came from Lord Mackay of Clashfern, theformer Conservative Lord Chancellor. Lord Mackay conceded that there is aninevitable tension between the role of Lord Chancellor as a judge and his roleas a member of the executive. Nevertheless, Lord Mackay argued that thesetensions are offset by the benefits which are perceived to flow from the closeChapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law
11019 As was Viscount Kilmuir in 1962.

The Separation of Powers
relationship. First, he supported Lord Hailsham’s view that the Lord
Chancellor should be able to advance and defend the cause of theadministration of justice within Cabinet. Secondly, Lord Mackay stated thatthe linkage promotes a realisation that:
... both the judiciary and the executive are parts of the total government of the
country with functions which are distinct but which must work together in aproper relationship if the country is to be properly governed. [1994, p 18]
Speaker of the House of Lords
The Lord Chancellor is a member of the House of Lords and presides over its
proceedings as ex officio Speaker. He is the principal spokesman for the
government in the Lords (on which see, further, below). The LordChancellor’s salary as Speaker is paid under the Ministerial and Other SalariesAct 1975. 
As a member of Cabinet, the Lord Chancellor cannot be a politically
impartial figure, nor can he be politically impartial when acting in his capacityof government spokesman and head of the House of Lords in its legislativecapacity. Some separation of function in this latter regard is secured byconvention. When speaking for the government in debate, the Chancellorremoves himself from the Woolsack
20and speaks from a spot appointed by
King Henry VIII.21It is by this means that he can be identified as having
changed from the impartial Speaker of the House of Lords to governmentspokesman. 
The Lord Chancellor and judicial proceedings
The Lord Chancellor is a member of the House of Lords Appellate Committeeand the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and, accordingly, willparticipate in decisions which affect both common law and statutoryinterpretation. In relation to his judicial functions as member of the House ofLords, it is by convention that the Chancellor will not preside over, or bejudicially involved in, cases which involve the government or are overtlypolitical in nature. Some Lord Chancellors sit rarely in their judicial capacity;others are judicially active. Lord Gardiner, for example, presided over onlytwo appeals in six years, whereas Lord Hailsham presided over 37 appeals ineight years. Lord Mackay of Clashfern presided over five appeals in the firstfive months of entering office, although in each case the appeals were arguedbefore he assumed the office of Lord Chancellor, the judgments being handeddown after he had taken office.
22The extent to which Lord Chancellors ought
to participate in appeals – and the type of appeals they should hear – is amatter for debate. It is clear that the Lord Chancellor should not sit on appeals

Lords.

in which the government is a party to the proceedings, or where the
government has a clear interest in the matter litigated. 
The requirements of judicial impartiality, however, were tested before the
European Court of Human Rights in a judgment which has implications forthe role of the Lord Chancellor. In McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000), a case
relating to the position of the Deputy Bailiff of Guernsey as President of theStates of Deliberation (Guernsey’s legislative body) and subsequently as thesole judge of law in proceedings relating to the applicant’s planningapplication which had been refused, the Court of Human Rights held that theDeputy Bailiff’s position was ‘capable of casting doubt’ on his ‘impartiality’and as a result was in violation of Article 6(1) of the European Convention ofHuman Rights, which guarantees ‘a fair and public hearing ... by anindependent and impartial tribunal established by law’. The Bailiff inGuernsey occupies a number of positions. He is a senior judge of the RoyalCourt and is ex officio President of the Guernsey Court of Appeal. In his non-
judicial capacity, the Bailiff is President of the States of Election, of the Statesof Deliberation, and of four states committees (the Appointments Board, theEmergency Council, the Legislation Committee and the Rules of ProcedureCommittee). He also has a role in communications between the Guernseyauthorities and the United Kingdom Government and the Privy Council.Referring to its earlier decision in Findlay v United Kingdom (1997),
23the Court
re-stated the requirements of ‘independence’ and ‘impartiality’. Onindependence, the Court declared that, in establishing whether the court ortribunal was independent, regard had to be had, inter alia, to the ‘manner of
appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence ofguarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the bodypresent an appearance of independence’. On impartiality, the Court re-statedthe proposition that the tribunal:
... must [first] be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Second, it must
also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficientguarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect ...
In the instant case, there was no question of actual bias on the part of the Bailiff;
nevertheless, the Court considered that ‘any direct involvement in the passageof legislation’, or of executive rules, was likely to be sufficient to cast doubt onthe judicial impartiality of a person subsequently called on to determine adispute over whether reasons exist to permit a variation from the wording ofthe legislation or rules at issue. Accordingly, ‘the mere fact that the DeputyBailiff presided over the court ... was capable of casting doubt on hisimpartiality...’. There was, accordingly, a violation of the requirements of fairtrial before an independent and impartial tribunal.Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Separation of Powers
The Lord Chancellor’s Department
The Lord Chancellor is assisted in his work by the Lord Chancellor’s
Department. The Department is divided into divisions dealing with judicialappointments and legislation, court service management, policy and legalservices, establishment and finance. 
Concerns over the democratic accountability of the Department and the
Lord Chancellor have long been voiced (see, further, below). The LordChancellor’s membership of the House of Lords precludes any personalaccountability to the House of Commons. The Attorney General, until 1992,deputised for the Lord Chancellor in the Commons and acted as a ‘courier’between the Commons and the Lords. Since that time, there has been aParliamentary Under Secretary of State to the Lord Chancellor in the House ofCommons, and it is hoped that, by this means, the Commons will be able toensure enhanced accountability. From 1991, the House of Commons HomeAffairs Select Committee has included review of the work of the LordChancellor’s Department. In addition, the Department is subject to thescrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons. 
A Minister of Justice?
The parliamentary accountability of the Lord Chancellor has long beencriticised and various proposals made to introduce the office of a Minister ofJustice. Rodney Brazier points to the ‘undesirable’ consequences which flowfrom the separation of responsibility for criminal law reform, which is amatter for the Home Office, and civil law reform, which is for the LordChancellor’s Department, but for which there is no minister withresponsibility accountable to the House of Commons. Brazier calls for nothingless than fundamental reform of the present arrangements with abolition ofthe office of Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chancellor’s Office and theintroduction of a new Department of Law.
24The term ‘Ministry of Justice’ is
avoided deliberately by Brazier on the basis that, whenever the phrase is used,the reaction of the judiciary is one of alarm. Lord Chancellor Hailsham, forexample, regarded the proposal
25by the Social Democratic Party and Liberal
Party Alliance (now merged into the Liberal Democrat Party) for a newDepartment of Justice
26as ‘constitutionally very dangerous’ and ‘a menace to
the independence of the judiciary’.27Lord Mackay of Clashfern rejected the
need for a Ministry of Justice, arguing that the new forms of accountability inthe House of Commons – through the Parliamentary Under Secretary and the

accountability.28
The judiciary
Appointment
The Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, President of the Family Division,Vice Chancellor, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and Lord Justices of Appeal areappointed by the Queen.
29By convention, the appointments are made on
consultation with the Prime Minister, who will have consulted the LordChancellor. The Lord Chancellor makes appointments to the High Courtbench. Candidates must meet the qualification requirements. Forappointments to the High Court, the candidate must be a barrister of tenyears’ standing, or a solicitor with rights of audience in the High Court, or acircuit judge of two years’ standing. For appointment to the Court of Appeal,the candidate must either be a barrister of ten years’ standing, a solicitor withrights of audience in the High Court, or a current member of the High CourtBench.
30
The socio-economic and educational background of the judiciary has been
subjected to much research. In brief, the picture presented is one of a middleand upper class, middle aged, white, predominantly male, judiciarydominated by public school and Oxford or Cambridge Universityeducation.
31The process of selection has traditionally been shrouded in
secrecy, with records of eligible candidates, who in practice will be successfulpractitioners, being maintained by the Lord Chancellor’s Department. Thecriteria for selection are ability, experience, standing, integrity and physicalhealth.
32It has been argued that the appointment of senior judges should be
made by a Judicial Commission rather than on the recommendation of theLord Chancellor alone.
33For appointments at High Court level and above, the
Lord Chancellor consults with a number of senior judges, but the ultimatedecision rests with the Lord Chancellor. At circuit judge level and below,appointments are filled by open competition, with public advertisements andinterviews of candidates by selection boards which include lay members.
34
Tenure
The Act of Settlement 1700 secured a senior35judge’s tenure of office during
‘good behaviour’. More modern expression is given to this protection underChapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law

hold office during good behaviour, removable only by Her Majesty on an
Address presented to her by both Houses of Parliament. Senior judges cannotbe dismissed for political reasons. They can be removed by compulsoryretirement if they are incapacitated or unable to resign through incapacity.
37
Judges can be dismissed for misbehaviour, and under an Address to theCrown made by the two Houses of Parliament. ‘Misbehaviour’ relates to theperformance of a judge’s official duties or the commission of a criminaloffence. Not every judge convicted of an offence will be dismissed: six judgeshave been convicted for driving with an excess of alcohol in their blood buthave continued in office. In 1830, Sir Jonah Barrington was removed fromoffice in Ireland under the Address procedure for the embezzlement ofmonies paid into court. Theoretically, a judge can also be removed by‘impeachment’ for ‘high crimes and misdemeanours’, although this procedurehas not been used since 1805
38and is thought to be obsolete.39In Scotland,
judges can only be removed on the grounds of misconduct.40
The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 introduced the retirement
age of 70, which may be extended to 75 if in the public interest. From 1959, theretirement ages were set at 75 for a High Court judge and 72 for a circuitjudge, although judges appointed before this date were permitted to remain inoffice.
41
Salaries
In order further to protect the judiciary from political debate, judicial salariesare charged on the Consolidated Fund.
42Judicial salaries are relatively high,
on the basis that it is in the national interest ‘to ensure an adequate supply ofcandidates of sufficient calibre for appointment to judicial office’.

professional or business work. Judges are also disqualified from membership
of the House of Commons.45Membership of the House of Commons does
not, however, disqualify that person from appointment to the Bench. 
Immunity from suit
All judges have immunity from legal action in the performance of theirjudicial functions. Provided that a judge acts within jurisdiction, or honestlybelieves he is acting within his jurisdiction, no action for damages may lie.Judges are immune from the law of defamation and, even if ‘actuated byenvy, hatred and malice and all uncharitableness’, he is protected.
46In Sirros v
Moore (1975), Lord Denning MR and Ormrod LJ ruled that every judge –
irrespective of rank and including the lay magistracy – is protected fromliability in respect of his judicial function provided that he honestly believedthat the action taken was within his jurisdiction.
47The Crown Proceedings
Act 1947 also provides protection for the Crown from liability for conduct ofany person discharging ‘responsibilities of a judicial nature vested in him’ orin executing the judicial process.
48
Bias or personal interest
A judge is under a duty not to adjudicate on cases in which he has either aninterest – whether personal or financial – or where he may be influenced bybias. A fundamental doctrine of natural justice is that ‘no man should be judgein his own cause’: nemo iudex in sua causa. 
Financial interests
In Dr Bonham’s Case (1609) Lord Coke held that members of a board which
determined physicians’ fines could not both impose and receive the fines, thus
giving early judicial expression to the requirement of freedom from bias.Rather more recently, in Dimes v Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the
propriety of Lord Cottenham LC adjudicating was challenged on the basisthat the Lord Chancellor held shares in the canal company involved inlitigation. The House of Lords set aside the decision of the court despite thefact that:
No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be in the remotest degree
influenced by the interest ... It is of the last importance that the maxim that noman is to be judge in his own cause should be held sacred. [p 793]Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law

46Sirros v Moore (1975), p 132, perLord Denning MR. See, also, Fray v Blackburn (1863);

are words spoken by participants in legal proceedings ( Munster v Lamb (1883)).
Barristers cannot be sued for negligence in the presentation of a client’s case ( Rondel v
Worsley (1969)).
47 See Brazier, 1976.
48 Crown Proceedings Act 1947, s 2(5).

The Separation of Powers
Thus, the mere existence of a financial interest, even where it does not in fact
result in actual bias but may present the appearance of bias, will be sufficientto disqualify a judge from adjudication. The same position prevails in theUnited States of America,
49where the issue of financial interests of federal
judges is expressly covered by law. The Ethics in Government Act 1978requires that Supreme Court and Federal judges must make a publicdeclaration of ‘income, gifts, shares, liabilities and transactions in securitiesand real estate’,
50a protection which is conspicuously absent in the United
Kingdom. 
A financial interest in a case which does not go beyond the financial
interest of any other citizen does not disqualify judges from sitting. Thus, inBromley London Borough Council v Greater London Council (1983), for example,
the fact that all the judges in the Court of Appeal were taxpayers and users ofpublic transport in London did not disqualify them from hearing the case. 
Other bias 
Judges, like everyone else, may be biased by virtue of race, sex, politics,
background, association and opinions.
51When adjudicating they must,
however, be demonstrably impartial. This impartiality involves:
... the judge listening to each side with equal attention, and coming to a decision
on the argument, irrespective of his personal view about the litigants ...
and, further, that:
Whatever his personal beliefs, the judge should seek to give effect to thecommon values of the community, rather than any sectional system of valuesto which he may adhere.
52
Where a judge himself feels that he has a bias against one of the parties to
litigation he may disqualify himself from sitting on the case, as did LordDenning MR in Ex parte Church of Scientology of California (1978). There,
counsel for the Church requested that he disqualify himself as a result of eightprevious cases involving the Church on which he had adjudicated, and inwhich, in the eyes of the Church, he displayed bias against them. 
Nineteen eighty-nine witnessed the start of a high profile case in which the
doctrine of judicial impartiality was re-stated by the House of Lords. Earlier inthe year, the former President of Chile, Senator Pinochet, arrived in Britain ona private visit for medical tests. The Spanish government sought the arrestand extradition of Pinochet on charges involving the murder, torture and thehostage-taking of Spanish citizens in Chile between 1973 and 1979. Twoprovisional warrants for Pinochet’s arrest had been granted following theSpanish proceedings. Pinochet then sought judicial review of the decision to
11749 28 USC §455(b).
50 See Cranston, 1979.51 See Griffith, 1991.52 Bell, 1983, pp 4 and 8.

grant an arrest warrant and an order of certiorari to quash the decision. At
first instance, the Queen’s Bench Division ruled that Pinochet enjoyedsovereign immunity as a former Head of State.
53On appeal to the House of
Lords, the court ruled – by a majority of three to two judges – that formerHeads of State enjoyed immunity from arrest and extradition proceedings inthe United Kingdom only in respect of official acts performed in the exerciseof their functions as a Head of State. Torture and hostage-taking could not beregarded as part of Pinochet’s official functions and therefore were excludedfrom immunity. In the course of the hearing before the House of Lords,several organisations – including Amnesty International – had been grantedleave to intervene and submit evidence to the court. Following the decision,Senator Pinochet’s lawyers complained to the Home Secretary that one of thejudges, Lord Hoffmann, was a director of the Amnesty InternationalCharitable Trust and, as a result, was disqualified from sitting, on the basisthat his participation raised the question of bias: of a judge ‘sitting on his owncause’. Senator Pinochet accordingly applied for the decision to be set aside.Lord Hoffmann had been one of the three majority judges. In anunprecedented move, and in the light of extensive national and internationalpublicity, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, the most senior of the 12 Law Lords,convened a differently constituted panel of judges to reconsider the case. Allfive judges agreed that the earlier decision could not stand. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, reiterating the principle that it was ‘of fundamental importancethat justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedlybe seen to be done’,
54stated that ‘once it was shown that the judge was
himself a party to the cause, or had a relevant interest in its subject matter, hewas disqualified without any investigation into whether there was alikelihood or suspicion of bias. The mere fact of his interest was sufficient todisqualify him unless he made sufficient disclosure’.
55
The Pinochet case, a unique and unprecedented case which brought the
highest domestic court under public scrutiny, spawned further challengesagainst judges, alleging bias of one form or another. It also led to calls for aregister of judges’ interests, in which any interests which might raise thequestion of bias could be recorded and made public, a proposal rejected byLord Browne-Wilkinson as unworkable: whereas it was generally clear whenMembers of Parliament’s interests conflict with their professional duties, as heput it, ‘a judge [unlike Members of Parliament] may be dealing with anything,any local club or society ... there’s no end to it’.

The Separation of Powers
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXECUTIVE 
AND LEGISLATURE; LEGISLATURE AND 
JUDICIARY; EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY
In light of the doctrine of separation of powers, it is necessary to evaluate the
manner in which, and extent to which, separate functions are allocatedbetween the differing bodies and kept separate. This task is most convenientlyundertaken by examining the relationship between first, the executive andlegislature, secondly, the legislature and judiciary and, thirdly, the executiveand judiciary.
Executive and legislature
The personnel of government
Parliament provides the personnel of government. ministers of the Crown,including the Prime Minister, must be members of either House of Parliament.By convention, the Prime Minister must be a member of the House ofCommons and it is for this reason that Lord Home renounced his peerage in1963, under the Peerage Act of that year, to revert to being Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Leader of the Conservative Party and subsequently Prime Minister. Itis thus immediately apparent that the executive, far from being separatedfrom the legislature, is drawn from within its ranks. It is for this reason thatWalter Bagehot in The English Constitution denounced the theory of the
separation of powers under the English constitution. For Bagehot, this featureof the constitution, however, far from being a dangerous divergence from anideal separation of powers, had clear merits. To Bagehot, the close relationshipbetween executive and parliament represented ‘the efficient secret of theEnglish constitution’ which:
... may be described as the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the
executive and legislative powers. No doubt by the traditional theory, as itexists in all the books, the goodness of our constitution lies in the entireseparation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth its meritconsists in their singular approximation. The connecting link [between theexecutive and parliament] is the Cabinet. [Bagehot (1867), 1993, pp 67–68]
There are, however, opposing views. Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor in
the 1979–87 parliament, asserted57that the current electoral process which,
generally, but not invariably, returns a government with a large majority ofseats in parliament, contributes to what he termed an ‘elective dictatorship’ –that is to say, a situation in which the executive controls the legislature. WhileBagehot’s view may have been tenable at the time in which he wrote, it is
11957 (1976) 120 SJ 693.

nowadays too simplistic and inaccurate a description of the working of the
constitution.58
Prima facie, this close union of executive and legislature would suggest that
the potential for abuse against which Montesquieu warned exists at the heartof the constitution. This would be so if it were to be demonstrated that theexecutive controls parliament. Judgment on that matter must be suspendeduntil the working of parliament has been examined in detail, in Chapters14–16. There exist, however, tenable grounds for such an argument, but thesemust be set against the extent to which procedural mechanisms in parliamentavoid an actual or potential abuse of power by the executive. Theconstitutional principle entailed in this close union between executive andlegislature, deriving from historical practice, is that of ‘responsiblegovernment’: that is to say that the powers of government are scrutinisedadequately by a democratically elected parliament to whom every member ofgovernment is individually and collectively responsible.
Statutory limits on membership
There exist statutory limits on the extent to which the executive can dominateparliament. The House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 preserves theseparation between the executive and legislature by providing that certaincategories of people are disqualified from holding parliamentary office. Undersection 2, holders of judicial office, civil servants, members of the armed forcesand the police and members of foreign legislatures are debarred from office.
The Act also limits the number of government ministers in the House of
Commons to 95 (section 2). Despite this limitation, 95 ministers, whenconsidered together with their loyal Parliamentary Private Secretaries,
59
ensures that the government will generally enjoy the automatic support ofsome 120 Members of Parliament. Where the government has been electedwith a strong majority of seats – as in 1983, when the Conservative Party had amajority of 144, and in 1997, when the electorate returned a Labourgovernment with a majority of 179 – it must be conceded that the potential fordominance exists. An evaluation of this matter depends upon the adequacy ofparliamentary procedures.
Political and procedural checks on government
The government, it must be recognised, irrespective of the size of its majorityof seats in parliament, is dependent upon parliament for its continuance inoffice. The loss of a vote of confidence on a matter of policy central to agovernment’s programme will cause the government to fall, as occurred inChapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law
12058 Richard Crossman (1993) states that Bagehot provides a correct description of Cabinet
government as it was between 1832 and 1867; but see the opposing view expressed by
Vile, 1967.
59 Who are elected Members of Parliament.

The Separation of Powers
1979 when the Labour Prime Minister, Mr James Callaghan, was forced to
seek a dissolution of parliament and call a general election. Furthermore,parliamentary procedures are devised to secure adequate scrutiny forlegislative proposals, and it cannot merely be assumed that the governmentwill always get its legislation through in the form which it envisaged. By wayof example, in 1983–84, the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill wassubstantially amended following pressure from politicians of all parties,pressure groups, academics and lawyers. In 1986, the government – despitehaving a strong majority in parliament – was forced to abandon its plans forlegislation to deregulate Sunday trading due to parliamentary pressure. In1994, the Conservative government faced unprecedented opposition overmembership of the European Community and Union. While the governmentnarrowly won a vote of confidence in the Commons, eight of its own membersrefused to support the government and the Conservative Party whip
60was
withdrawn. The constitutional effect of losing eight members under the whipwas to place the government in the position of a minority government.
61In
the following week, the government lost a vote, on an increase in the level ofVAT on domestic fuel in the European Finance Bill, when eight of its memberssupported the Opposition and a further seven members abstained fromvoting. As a result, the government became dependent upon the uncertainsupport of Members of Parliament not subject to party discipline and ofsupport from members of opposition parties. The Chancellor of the Exchequerimmediately announced that the Bill would be dropped and that the requisiterevenue would be raised through other means, namely the introduction of a‘mini budget’ in December 1994. 
The Opposition
The role of the official Opposition must also be considered. Her Majesty’s
Loyal Opposition is, constitutionally speaking, a ‘government in waiting’. Notonly is it the function of the Opposition to question, challenge and oppose thegovernment, but it also puts forward alternative policies and solutions toproblems. In order to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for theOpposition to fulfil its constitutional role, 20 days per session are set aside fordebate on subjects chosen by the Opposition.
62
Question Time, debates and select committees
Question Time and debates in parliament ensure the accountability ofgovernment to parliament. The administration of the state is scrutinised by asystem of Select Committees in parliament with wide powers of inquiry.
12160 The organisational and disciplinary government members who control and co-ordinate
parliamentary business. Loss of the whip, in effect, renders Members of Parliament
without a political party.
61 In the 1992 election, the government had a majority of 21 seats.
62 Standing Order No 13.

The House of Lords
In addition to checks within the House of Commons, the House of Lords may
cause government to modify or abandon proposed legislation. The House ofLords has the power to amend and delay non-Money Bills for approximatelya year before the Bill can receive the royal assent under the Parliament Acts1911 and 1949. Rather than risk the delay of legislation, the government mayprefer to compromise its proposals and accept proposed amendments fromthe Lords.
The electorate
Finally, the electorate, in addition to its role in a general election, can alsoexpress its displeasure with government policies during a parliamentary termat by-elections and local government elections. In the 1993 county councilelections, the government lost control of many of the councils which had beenits traditional supporters – clear evidence that no government can afford toignore the views of the people. Subsequent by-elections confirmed thegovernment’s loss of electoral support, as did the general election on 1 May1997, when the Conservative government suffered a humiliating defeat.
Delegated legislation and the separation of powers
Delegated – or secondary – legislation raises important questions relating tothe separation of powers. Delegated legislation refers to laws, rules andregulations, made by government departments, local authorities and otherpublic bodies, under the authority of an Act of Parliament: ‘... every exercise ofa power to legislate conferred by or under an Act of Parliament.’
63
The principal justification for the delegation of such law making power is
efficiency. By granting delegated power, parliament is freed from scrutinising
every technical detail of a Bill. Delegated power also enables ministers andothers to ‘fill in the details’ after the parent Act is in force. AV Dicey approvedof delegated powers on this basis.
64Delegated power has, however, been
questioned. In 1929, Chief Justice Hewart65criticised delegated legislation as
being an abuse of power. An Interdepartmental Committee of Inquiry onMinisters’ Powers
66exonerated ministers from this charge and defended both
the necessity and desirability of delegated legislation. 
In any parliamentary year, some 60 to 70 Acts of Parliament will be
passed. The volume of delegated legislation, however, may amount to some2,000 statutory instruments per year. While general Bills – public and private –are subjected to full parliamentary scrutiny, it will be seen in Chapter 15 thatChapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law

65 Hewart, 1929.66 Donoughmore-Scott Committee, Cmnd 4046, 1932, London: HMSO.

The Separation of Powers
delegated legislation receives far more cursory examination by parliament as a
whole. The implication of delegated legislation in constitutional terms is that alegislative function is being exercised by the executive and not parliament.The delegation of law making power is a necessity given the heavy legislativeprogramme and the modern complexity of legal regulation. Provided thatparliamentary scrutiny is adequate, and that the courts are vigilant andeffective in ensuring that delegated powers are exercised consistently with thelaw – intra vires – it may be concluded that this ostensible breach of the
separation of powers is unavoidable, although whether it is subject toadequate scrutiny and control remains questionable.
Legislature and judiciary
It has been stated above that parliament is sovereign and that the judiciary issubordinate to parliament. It has also been stated, perhaps paradoxically, thatthe judiciary is independent. This raises the question of how such apparentlyconflicting assertions can be reconciled. At the head of the judiciary is theCrown. The Crown represents the ‘fountain of justice’ and all judicial acts arecarried out in the name of the Crown. In law, it is the Crown which appointsall senior judges, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister and the LordChancellor. 
Rules against criticism of the judiciary
To reinforce the independence of judges, convention dictates that there shouldbe no criticism levelled at them from members of the executive – but not fromother Members of Parliament. Parliamentary practice prohibits the criticism ofjudges other than under a motion expressing specific criticism or leading to anAddress to the Crown for the removal of a judge. It was not, however,regarded as a breach of conventional rules when the then Prime Minister, MrsThatcher, in parliament, criticised the light sentence imposed on a childmolester.
67There have, however, been other incidents where judges have
been criticised in parliament. In 1977, for example, motions were tabled for thedismissal of judges who had reduced a sentence for rape. Further, a judgewho described a rape victim as guilty of contributory negligence wascriticised in parliament.
68The manner in which Members of Parliament are
controlled in terms of what they may, or may not, say is through the powersof the Speaker of the House of Commons. These powers will be considered inChapters 14 and 18.

The subjudice rule
Where civil proceedings are either before a court or awaiting trial, Members of
Parliament are barred from raising them in debate. If the matter has not yetreached the courts, debate may be barred if the Speaker considers that therewould result a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the trial arising as aconsequence. No reference may be made to criminal proceedings from thetime of the charge being made until the final appeal is determined.
Parliamentary supremacy and the judicial function 
The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy entails the necessary constitutionalsubordination of judges to parliament and has several implications. First, it iswell established that the sovereign parliament can overturn any court decisionby way of legislation.
69Secondly, the judiciary’s primary role in relation to the
interpretation of statutes is to give effect to the latest expression of the will ofparliament.
70
Judges as legislators
One of the most debated aspects of the relationship between the legislatureand the judges lies in the question: ‘Do judges make law?’ In constitutionalterms, the issue is whether by making law – either by virtue of the doctrine ofprecedent or through the interpretation of statutes – the judges are usurpingthe legislative function or, in other words, violating the separation ofpowers.
71
The rules of statutory interpretation, devised by the judges themselves, are
designed to limit judicial creativity. Statutory interpretation is notstraightforward, even though Acts of Parliament are couched in detailedlanguage in order to maximise clarity and minimise vagueness or obscurity.Despite this attempt to achieve clarity in statutory language, it is artificial todeny that judges ‘make law’. Every new meaning conferred on a word, everyapplication of a rule to a new situation, whether by way of statutoryinterpretation or under common law, ‘creates’ new law. Judges havethemselves abandoned the fiction of the ‘declaratory theory’ which assertsthat they do not ‘make’ law but merely discover its true meaning. From theseparation of powers perspective, judicial law making should cause disquietonly if judges display overtly dynamic law making tendencies. By way ofillustration, in Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council v Newport Corporation(1965), Lord Denning MR was accused by Lord Simonds in the House ofLords of ‘naked usurpation of the legislative function’.Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law
12469 Eg, the War Damage Act 1965.
70Vauxhall Estates Ltd v Liverpool Corporation (1932); Ellen Street Estates Ltd v Minister of
Health (1934).
71 This issue is complex and outside the scope of this work. See, for detailed discussion,
Slapper and Kelly, 2001, pp 9–14, 246–46. See, also, Reid, 1972.

The Separation of Powers
Lord Simonds, in the House of Lords, reviewing Lord Denning’s
approach, roundly rejected Lord Denning’s broad ‘gap filling’ attitude to
interpretation:
The court, having discovered the intention of Parliament and of ministers too,
must proceed to fill in the gaps. What the legislature has not written, the courtmust write. This proposition, which restates in a new form the view expressed... in the earlier case ... cannot be supported. It appears to me to be a nakedusurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.And it is less justifiable when it is guesswork with what material the legislaturewould, if it had discovered the gap, have filled it in. If a gap is disclosed, theremedy lies in an amending Act.
72
Lord Denning’s contribution to developing the law was marked in many
areas. His judicial ‘campaign’ to protect the occupational rights of desertedwives
73ultimately led to enactment of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967,
giving statutory protection to rights of occupation in the matrimonial home.Placed within the context of separation of powers and the position of judgesas subordinate to parliament, it can be seen that the courts developed thecommon law to a point where parliament felt it necessary to legislate. Burmah
Oil v Lord Advocate (1965) further illustrates the point. The government, being
dismayed at the implications of the House of Lords’ decision overcompensation rights for property destroyed in wartime, passed the WarDamage Act 1965 to nullify the decision retrospectively. Such is thesovereignty of parliament.
The reference by judges to government publications and records of
parliamentary proceedings, for the purposes of interpreting statutes, hastraditionally been regarded as improper. In Davis v Johnson (1979), Lord
Denning MR stated that privately he looked at Hansard in order to establish
the true construction of a statute, a revelation not approved of by the House ofLords. The Renton Committee’s Report on the Preparation of Legislation
74and
the Law Commission’s Report on the Interpretation of Statutes75had both ruled
against any relaxation of the rules on the basis, inter alia, that such reference
was of doubtful benefit, difficult in practice and costly. Exceptions to this ruleexisted. For example, in Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke AG
(1975), the House of Lords accepted that reference could be made to LawCommission reports and to the reports of parliamentary committees in orderto establish the defect in the previous law which parliament was seeking toredress. Further, in Pickstone v Freemans plc (1989) ,reference to Hansard was
regarded as justified for the purpose of determining the purpose of thelegislation and government policy. Until the case of Pepper v Hart (1992), it had
been widely accepted that the courts should not, except under these

circumstances, consult materials preparatory to the enactment of the statute or
the records of parliamentary proceedings in connection with its passage inorder to assist with the task of interpretation. In Pepper v Hart, however, the
House of Lords conceded the limited right to resort to Hansard as an aid to
interpretation. The Attorney General had argued that any relaxation in therules would amount to a questioning of the freedom of speech in debate inparliament contrary to Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, for the majority, rejected that reasoning, declaring that far from‘questioning the independence of parliament and its debates, the courts wouldbe giving effect to what is said and done there’. For post- Pepper v Hart
developments, see Chapter 18.
The High Court of Parliament 
Parliament has the sovereign power to regulate its own composition andprocedure. Under parliamentary privilege – derived from the law and customof parliament and thus part of the common law – parliament, and not thecourts, has jurisdiction to rule on its own powers. Parliament cannot, however– other than by an Act of Parliament – extend its own privileges.
76The role of
the judges in relation to privilege is to rule on its existence and extent. Oncethe court is satisfied that a particular matter falls within parliament’s domain,it will defer to parliament. Accordingly, if, for example, a citizen is defamedby the absolute privilege of free speech in parliamentary proceedings,
77there
is no legal redress. Privilege will thus protect the Member of Parliament fromthe law of defamation and leave the aggrieved individual without a legalremedy. 
Privilege also extends to regulating the legislative process. It is for
parliament alone to determine the procedure by which an Act of Parliamentshould come into being. It is clearly established that, in order to become anAct of Parliament, a Bill must pass its legislative stages in the Commons andLords (except where the Parliament Acts apply) before receiving the royalassent. Once that process is complete, it is not for the judiciary to inquirebehind the parliamentary roll.
78
Executive and judiciary
With regard to the relationship between the executive and the judiciary,several matters having implications for the separation of powers requireexamination: the attitude of the courts in matters entailing the exercise of theroyal prerogative; parliamentary privilege; judicial review; the role of judgesin non-judicial functions; and the role of the Law Officers of the Crown.

The Separation of Powers
The royal prerogative
Detailed consideration of the royal prerogative will be undertaken in Chapter
6. The royal prerogative has significant implications for the separation ofpowers. Being the residue of monarchical power, the prerogative is part of thecommon law and thus amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts. Today, thevast majority of prerogative powers are exercised by the government in thename of the Crown. As will be seen later, the substance of many prerogativepowers is political, entailing matters of policy which the judges are notcompetent to decide or – to phrase it differently – matters which, if ruled onby the judges in a manner inconsistent with the interpretation of the executive,would place the judges in a sensitive constitutional position and open toaccusations of a violation of the separation of powers. That is not to suggest,however, that the courts have no role to play with respect to the royalprerogative. The traditional role of the courts is to rule on the existence andscope of the prerogative, but – having defined its existence and scope – todecline thereafter to rule on the exercise of the power. However, in Council of
Civil Service Unions v Minister of State for Civil Service (1985) (the GCHQ case),
the House of Lords made it clear that the courts have jurisdiction to reviewthe exercise of executive power irrespective of whether the source of power isstatutory or under the prerogative. Having seemingly extended thejurisdiction of the courts in relation to the prerogative, the House of Lords,nevertheless, proceeded to rule that there exists a wide range of ‘non-justiciable’ matters which should be decided by the executive rather than thecourts: a clear expression of the separation of powers. 
By way of further example of the relationship between the executive and
the courts in prerogative matters, the power to enter treaties underinternational law is a hallmark of a sovereign state and derives from the royalprerogative. The courts have consistently declined to become involved inmatters of treaty making or its implications. When, in 1993, Lord Rees-Moggsought to challenge ratification of the Maastricht Treaty under the prerogativeby an application for judicial review, the court declined jurisdiction.
79At the
time, the Speaker of the House warned the courts against interference with thebusiness of parliament.
80To claim and exercise jurisdiction over such a matter
would place the judges above the executive – effectively alter the balancewithin the constitution – and place ultimate power in an unelected,unaccountable judiciary. It is for this reason that the judges are traditionallycautious when matters of prerogative are involved, and that caution isprotective of the separation of powers, but may also prove to be detrimental tothe concept of the rule of law. 
12779R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte Rees-Mogg (1994).
80 (1993) The Times , 24 July.

Law Officers of the Crown
The Law Officers of the Crown – the Attorney General and the Solicitor
General – are members of the government. The Attorney General may also bea member of Cabinet. The Attorney General is bound by conventions whichserve to limit the overlap in functions. Thus, where his consent to prosecutionis required, by convention the Attorney General must avoid party politicalconsiderations, and may not take orders from government. This is aparticularly delicate matter when essentially political prosecutions are beingcontemplated.
81
The Law Officers are advisers to government and its ministers, and, by
convention, this advice must never be disclosed. In 1986, this convention wasbreached when Leon Brittan, then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,revealed advice given on the Westland Helicopter rescue plan.
82
Judicial review
Judicial review of administrative action is designed to keep those persons andbodies with delegated powers within the scope of the power conferred uponthem by parliament: the doctrine of intra vires. Thus, if a minister of the Crown
or a local authority exceeds the power granted, the courts will nullify thedecision taken and require that the decision maker reach a decision accordingto the correct procedure. Judicial review is concerned with the process bywhich decisions are made, not with the merits of the decision itself, nor withthe merits of the legal rules which are being applied by the administrator.From this perspective, it may be said that the judges are merely upholding thewill of parliament in controlling the exercise of powers delegated by it tosubordinate bodies. It could be said that the judges are here upholding boththe rule of law and the sovereignty of parliament. From another perspective,however, serious questions are raised for the separation of powers. Ifparliament confers on a minister of the Crown the power to decide a matter‘as he thinks fit’, to what extent is it constitutionally proper for a court of lawto intervene and question the manner of the exercise of his decision makingpower? Does this represent an intrusion into executive power on the part ofthe judiciary? Does it amount to judicial supremacy over the executive? 
Judicial review thus presents a constitutional paradox, representing, on the
one hand, a check on the executive – arguably infringing the doctrine ofseparation of powers – and, on the other hand, keeping the executive withinits legal powers, thus buttressing the sovereignty of parliament and the rule oflaw. Public and press criticism of the judiciary’s role in keeping the executiveunder check led to the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth,publicly defending the role of the judges. Speaking at an annual judges’Chapter 5: Constitutional and Administrative Law

82 See, further, Chapter 16.

The Separation of Powers
dinner, Lord Taylor rejected recent charges that the ‘senior judiciary have
decided to mount a bloodless coup and seize the commanding heights of theconstitution’. Recent cases involving the government – for example, theratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the declaration that the government hadacted unlawfully in relation to funding the Pergau Dam project in Malaysia,the appointment of Scott LJ to inquire and report on the arms to Iraq affair,and the appointment of Nolan LJ to inquire and report on standards in publiclife
83– have all recently raised the public profile of the judges. Lord Taylor
rejected the criticisms, stating that:
... nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed their [the judges’] aim and
function is quite the reverse. It is to ensure that powers are exercised by thoseto whom parliament has given them and in the way in which parliament hasspecified. 
Lord Taylor added that the judiciary was conscious that it must avoid
usurping the functions of the legislature or the executive – thus, reaffirmingthe doctrine of separation of powers.
84
Contemporary issues for the separation of powers doctrine
Two of the Labour government’s constitutional reform measures raiseparticularly difficult questions for the separation of powers, namely, theHuman Rights Act 1998, which ‘incorporates’ the European Convention onHuman Rights into domestic law, and the devolution of legislative andadministrative powers to regional assemblies. 
In relation to the Human Rights Act, the legislation was consciously
drafted in such a manner as to preserve the balance of power – and separationof power – between the judiciary and parliament. As will be seen more fully inChapter 19, this is accomplished by providing that primary (but notsecondary) legislation remains immune from judicial invalidation even wherethat legislation is ruled to be incompatible with Convention rights. Wherejudges in the higher courts make ‘declarations of incompatibility’, the matteris referred back to the executive to determine whether, and in what form,amending primary legislation should be enacted by parliament. While theHuman Rights Act came into force in England in October 2000, it was in effectin Scotland on the devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament and it wasfrom Scotland that early indications of the impact of the Act were discerned.Specifically relevant to the position of judges and their independence – acrucial aspect of the separation of powers – is the appointments system. InStarrs and Chalmers v Procurator Fiscal (1999), the Court of Session ruled that
the right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial tribunal,
12983R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte Rees-Mogg (1994); R v
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte World Development
Movement (1995), Chapters 11 and 16; and Chapters 11 and 18, respectively.
84 (1995) The Times , 6 July.

guaranteed under Article 6(1) of the Convention, would be violated where the
presiding judge held a temporary position with no guarantee of permanentappointment and security of tenure, unless so offered by the Lord Advocatewho enjoys discretion. In the case of Scotland, temporary sheriffs areappointed to serve one year, renewable terms, and they hear a largeproportion of Scottish criminal cases. The Court of Session ruled that such anappointments system, the lack of security of office and the discretion of theLord Advocate was incompatible with the right to fair trial. The sheriffs werenot sufficiently independent of the executive, and could only be so if therewere ‘adequate guarantees that the appointed judge enjoys security of tenure’.The court recognised that the fact that the executive appoints judges does not,of itself, signify a threat to judicial independence. Nevertheless, where a judgeis appointed on a temporary basis, and his or her re-appointment lies at thediscretion of the executive, judicial independence may be threatened by ajudge’s awareness of the power the executive holds over his or her judicialcareer. The Starrs and Chalmers case has widespread implications for the
system of judicial appointments throughout the United Kingdom and theLord Chancellor’s power to appoint tribunal members, Assistant Recordersand deputy High Court judges who lack security of tenure.
The Convention right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial
tribunal raises a further questions concerning judicial independence,questions which were highlighted in the course of the Pinochet case, discussed
above (pp 117–18), which in turn re-invigorated interest in the issue of judicialbias.
85At the root of the problem of judicial independence and public
confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, lies the system of appointmentsand promotions. As noted above, while appointments are theoretically madeby the Crown, in practice, the Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor enjoyvirtually untrammelled powers. The British appointments system isinherently secret, relying for the most part on the knowledge of the LordChancellor gleaned from ‘soundings’ taken within the profession.
86Despite
attempts to broaden the base from which judges are drawn, the profile ofjudges remains predominantly white, Oxbridge educated and male. Theselection procedure remains immune from public gaze and from independentscrutiny from a body, such as a Judicial Appointments Commission, whichcould ensure impartiality in appointments and promotions and thereby dispelthe disquiet which arises from a closed system, controlled by the LordChancellor, who is himself a political appointee.

and Gaming Licensing Committee ex parte O’Callaghan (2000).
86 For a critical evaluation, see Slapper and Kelly, 2001, Chapter 6.

The Separation of Powers
The devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly also raises issues for the separation of
powers. The legislative and administrative powers devolved must not onlycomply with the Human Rights Act 1998, but must also be intra vires the scope
of power devolved. Each of the Acts devolving power specifies the powerwhich is ‘excepted’, ‘reserved’ or ‘devolved’ to the body in question. While theGovernment of Scotland Act 1998 includes a limited list of reserved matters(‘reserved’ meaning that the United Kingdom Parliament retains legislativepower over the matter), and provides an extensive list of devolved power, theNorthern Ireland Act 1998 is less clear in relation to those powers reserved orexcluded than it is in legislative powers devolved which in effect are the sumof those subjects not excluded or reserved. The position under theGovernment of Wales Act 1998 is more straightforward: the Act devolvesprimarily administrative powers and not legislative power. Notwithstandingthe scope of power devolved, and its nature, however, disputes concerningdevolved issues will fall to the courts. In 1999, a Practice Direction was issued,laying down the procedure to be followed where a challenge arose overwhether a devolved body had acted or proposed to act within its powers,which includes not acting incompatibly with the Convention on HumanRights and Community law, or whether it had failed to comply with a dutyimposed on it. The effect of the dispute resolution procedure is to highlightfurther the role of the judges. Given that challenges to competence may bemotivated by political forces, and the consequence of a ruling adverse to thedevolved body being inherently political, the public profile of the judiciarywill inevitably be raised. It may be argued that, in essence, there is little novelabout the judiciary keeping constitutionally subordinate bodies (such as localauthorities) within the power granted by parliament, and there is much forcein this. On the other hand, the political stakes in devolution matters are ratherhigher than in relation to local government and, as high profile cases ofjudicial review in relation to local government have shown in the past,controversial decisions – such as the House of Lords’ decision in relation tothe then Greater London Council’s transport subsidy policy – give rise tocriticism and allegations of political bias. All the more important, then, thatthe independence of the judiciary from the executive, its policies and thepolitics of devolved institutions, be put and maintained beyond any doubt.
Judges as fact finders
It has become increasingly common for the executive to appoint judges aschairmen of tribunals of inquiry.
87That this should be so is unsurprising.
Judges are equipped by training and experience to review evidence with
13187 See Drewry, 1996.

impartiality and rigour and to present findings in a logical manner. In recent
years, inquiries have been conducted by judges in the following matters:88
(a) Interception of communications (Birkett LJ);
(b) Security matters: security in the public service (Lord Radcliffe);
(c) Vassall (Lord Radcliffe);(d) Profumo (Lord Denning);
(e) ‘D Notices’ (Lord Radcliffe);
(f) Industrial disputes: miners and electricity supply industry (Lord
Wilberforce);
(g) Disturbances in Northern Ireland in 1969 (Scarman J);(h) Interrogation methods (Lord Parker);
(i) Collapse of Vehicle and General Insurance Company (James J);
(j) Legal procedures in relation to terrorism (Lord Diplock);(k) ‘Bloody Sunday’ in Londonderry (Lord Widgery CJ);(l) Anti-terrorist legislation (Lord Gardiner);
(m)Public disorder: Red Lion Square, Brixton (Lord Scarman);
(n) Industrial dispute: Grunwick (Scarman LJ);(o) Interrogation methods (Bennett J);(p) Crown agents (Croom-Johnson);

89
(t) Standards in public life (Lord Nolan/Lord Neill);90
(u) Dunblane shootings (Lord Cullen);91and
(v) BSE in cattle (Lord Phillips).
Many of these inquiries involve sensitive political issues. As a result, it is
inevitable that judges will attract criticism from one quarter or another. Thereexists the potential for charges of political bias in the report, or that the judgehas avoided the issue and effected a ‘whitewash’, or that the inquiry has notbeen conducted properly.

The Separation of Powers
likely to ensue is to create the possibility that their independence and
impartiality will be damaged. 
CONCLUSION
Some academic constitutional authorities either deny, or minimise, therelevance of the doctrine of separation of powers under the United Kingdom’sconstitution. Geoffrey Marshall, for example, writes: 
To sum up: the notion of the Separation of Powers seems to suffer from the
following deficiencies:
First, it is rarely clear whether, and in what sense, there is such a separation.
The argument that legislative, executive, and judicial powers areconstitutionally declared to be vested in particular persons is inconclusive.
Secondly, if there is a separation of powers, it is unclear what it is that is
separated, since the notions of ‘legislation’, ‘adjudication’, and ‘execution’ havenot proved capable of precise definition ...
In short, the principle is infected with so much imprecision and inconsistency
that it may be counted little more than a jumbled portmanteau of argumentsfor policies which ought to be supported or rejected on other grounds.
92
On the other hand, it has been judicially asserted by Lord Diplock that:
... it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the British constitution, thoughlargely unwritten, is firmly based on the separation of powers: parliamentmakes the laws, the judiciary interprets them.
93
Equally, Sir John Donaldson MR has stated that:
... it is a constitutional convention of the highest importance that the legislatureand the judicature are separate and independent of one another, subject tocertain ultimate rights of parliament over the judicature ...
94
As Professor Munro has said, ‘there is something of a puzzle here ...’.
The separation of powers is certainly neither an absolute nor a
predominant feature of the British constitution. Nevertheless, it is a concept
which is firmly rooted in constitutional tradition and thought. Judicialassertions of the importance of the doctrine are explainable in light of theconstitutional position of judges in relation to parliament. The concept ofseparation of powers offers the judiciary a protective device both for theprotection of the independence of the judiciary and against allegations ofjudicial intrusion into matters more appropriate to parliament or theexecutive. The reluctance of judges to be drawn into such matters is reflectedparticularly strongly in relation to matters of the royal prerogative andparliamentary privilege.
95Accordingly, to deny the relevance of some form of

separation of powers would be to misconstrue the evidence. The separation of
powers is a principle respected under the constitution which exerts itsinfluence on each of the fundamental institutions of the state. While theseparation of powers is ill defined, and is not accorded absolute respect, itought not to ‘be lightly dismissed’.

CHAPTER 6
The King should not be over man, but under God and the law.1
INTRODUCTION
Under the constitution of the United Kingdom, all actions of government are
undertaken in the name of the Crown. Any account of the prerogative is anaccount of power, and the prerogative, historically and contemporarily,concerns the power of the Crown.
2The prerogative today represents one of
the most intriguing aspects of the unwritten constitution. In order fully toappreciate the meaning of the term ‘the Crown’, an analysis of both who infact exercises various powers in the name of the Crown, and the source of thepower exercised, needs to be examined. The question to be asked is: is thepower (to be exercised) a prerogative power or is it the outcome of statute? Aswill be seen, there is no certainty as to either the existing prerogative powersor the manner in which these may be extinguished. It is, however, clear thatno new prerogative powers can be created.
THE PREROGATIVE DEFINED
Blackstone defines the prerogative in his Commentaries (1765–69) as:
... that special pre-eminence which the King hath over and above all other
persons, and out of the ordinary course of the common law, in right of hisregal dignity. It signifies, in its etymology (from prae and rogo) something that
is required or demanded before, or in preference to, all others.
Dicey, on the other hand, describes the prerogative in the following manner:
... the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority, which at any time islegally left in the hands of the Crown ... Every act which the executivegovernment can lawfully do without the authority of an Act of Parliament isdone in virtue of this prerogative. [(1898), 1959, p 424]
From these differing definitions, the following can be deduced: first, that these
are powers which are inherent in, and peculiar to, the Crown; secondly, thatthe powers derive from common law; thirdly, that the powers are residual;fourthly, that the majority of the powers are exercised by the executivegovernment in the name of the Crown; and, finally, that no Act of Parliamentis necessary to confer authority on the exercise of such powers. 
135THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE
1 Bracton (1200–68).
2 On the distinctions between the monarch and the Crown, see Marshall, 1971, pp 17–24.

Joseph Chitty, whose work remains the most comprehensive account of
the prerogative, explains the need for prerogative power in the following
manner:
The rights of sovereignty, or supreme power, are of a legislative and executive
nature, and must, under any form of government, be vested exclusively in abody or bodies, distinct from the people at large. [1820, p 2]
In Chitty’s analysis, the power of the King is but part of a reciprocal
relationship between monarch and subject. To the King is owed a duty ofallegiance on the part of all subjects; to the subjects is owed the duty ofprotection.
THE PREROGATIVE BEFORE 1688
The King and parliament
It was for the King to summon parliament and to prorogue it. The King couldsuspend parliament’s sittings and dissolve it. Parliaments were held regularlyfrom 1295, and in 1311, it was decreed that parliament should meet twice ayear.
3In 1330, the first statute was passed requiring that parliament meet at
least once a year – and more frequently if necessary. At that time, parliamentdid not sit for a term of years, but rather was summoned to meet de novo each
year. The record was by no means constant: there were, for example, noparliaments in the years 1364, 1367, 1370, 1373–76, 1387, 1389, 1392, 1396 orbetween 1407–10. Under Edward IV (1442–83), only six parliaments met in thecourse of his 22 year reign. Under Henry VII (1457–1509), there were butseven parliaments, despite the Act of Edward III remaining on the statutebook. Whether and when a parliament should meet was much dependentupon the King’s need for revenue, for it had been established by the middle ofthe fourteenth century that it was unlawful for the King to impose direct taxeswithout parliament’s consent. On taxation, see, further, below, pp 140–42.
In the reign of Henry VIII, between 1491 and 1547, nine parliaments met in
38 years, although one of these lasted for seven years between 1529–36; underEdward VI (1547–53), two parliaments met, the second of which lasted fourand a half years. Mary reigned for over five years (1553–58) and parliamentmet annually throughout her reign. Under Elizabeth I (1558–1603), by way ofcomparison, a mere ten parliaments met, although one parliament lasted for11 years. In the reign of James I (1603–25), four parliaments met in 22 years,one lasting for nearly seven years. 
The absoluteness of the King’s power came to a head in the reign of
Charles I (1600–49) when Charles confronted parliament over taxation to meetthe cost of war, imprisoning over 70 people who refused to pay the forcedChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

loan, including the ‘five knights’4who sought a writ of habeas corpus against
the King. Sir Edward Coke supported members of the Commons who sought
to petition the King against unparliamentary taxation, imprisonment withoutgood cause, the billeting of troops and the imposition of martial law. Charlesaccepted the Petition of Right but, faced with continued opposition fromparliament, prorogued parliament in June 1628. Parliament was againsummoned in 1629 but confrontation was again rife, with the Commonscriticising the King’s religious policy and refusing to vote supply for theCrown. Charles decided to adjourn parliament in 1629 and there commencedan 11 year period of personal monarchical rule. In 1641, under the leadershipof Pym, the ‘Grand Remonstrance’ was drafted – listing the grievances of thecountry under the rule of prerogative. While the Commons was divided overthe Remonstrance, it represented a starting point in history, one which was tolead to the Civil War, Charles’s execution and the rule of Oliver Cromwellunder the only Republican constitution Britain has ever experienced.

The Crown and the Council
Members of the King’s Council were appointed and dismissed by the King atpleasure. While most matters of government and administration were decidedby the Council, the King was under no duty to heed their advice, and, under astrong King, the Council had little real power. Under a weak King, however,real power vested in the Council, and in the course of a King’s minority, the‘Council has ruled England’.
6Under King Edward II (1307–27), the Council
became a more formal body, with members being sworn in. The King inCouncil legislated, raised taxes and dispensed justice. FW Maitland observedthat it is difficult to discern, during that time, whether a particular act ofgovernment was effected by parliament or the King in Council. From 1386, theproceedings of the Council were recorded, and the Council was established asa permanent part of the machinery of government. 
Law making powers of the Crown
Proclamations
In Chapter 2, the constitutional upheavals of the seventeenth century werediscussed, and it is in this period of history, and in particular with theconstitutional settlement of 1689, that the origins of parliamentary sovereigntyare to be discovered. It will be recalled that it was Henry VIII (1509–47) whoasserted the power to make law by way of proclamations: ‘... the mostextraordinary act in the Statute Book.’
7The statute did not affect the common

law or existing Acts of Parliament, and it prohibited the use of the death
penalty for breach of proclamations. This, nevertheless, left a wide – and illdefined – scope for the Crown to legislate without parliament. The Act wasrepealed in the reign of Edward VI (1547–53). Its repeal was of greatconstitutional and symbolic importance in that it denied, by implication, thesupremacy of the King over parliament and declared that it was the ‘King inParliament’ which represented the lawful legislature. Nevertheless, both MaryI (1553–58) and Elizabeth I (1558–1603) continued to rule by proclamation.However, when James I (1603–25) asserted his right to rule by proclamation,his assumed power was challenged by an application from the King’s Councilto the courts. In the Case of Proclamations (1611), Chief Coke CJ declared that:
... the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the
common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm.
... the King cannot create any offence by his prohibition or proclamation, which
was not an offence before, for that was to change the law, and to make anoffence which was not.
Also, it was resolved that the King hath no prerogative but that which the law
of the land allows him.
Dispensing and suspending powers of the Crown
The King’s assent was needed for the enactment of statutes, but he also had
the power to dispense with statutes and suspend their application. Accordingto Coke, where statute affected the prerogative power, the King couldsuspend the Act.
8The conflict between Crown and the courts in the
seventeenth century is illustrated by the cases of Thomas v Sorrell (1674) and
Godden v Hales (1686). In Thomas v Sorrell , it was declared that the King could
not dispense with a penal law made for the good of the public. However, inGodden v Hales, the court accepted that the King could dispense with a penallaw – under specific circumstances – where that law fell within hisjurisdiction. In 1687, James II, intent on removing obstacles to RomanCatholics holding public office, issued a Declaration of Indulgence whichcondemned the principle of religious compulsion and announced that allpenal laws in ecclesiastical matters be suspended. In 1688, he went further,issuing a second Declaration of Indulgence which he instructed all Anglicanclergy to read from the pulpit. On an appeal from the seven bishops whoquestioned the legality of such a dispensing power, James II ordered theirarrest on a charge of seditious libel. In the Seven Bishops’ Case (1688), they were
acquitted. Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
1388Case of Proclamations (1611).

The Royal Prerogative
The King and the courts
It was within the King’s prerogative to establish new courts of justice. The
Court of Star Chamber, exercising extensive criminal jurisdiction with little ofthe formality of judicial proceedings and without the use of juries, wasestablished either under the Statute of 1487 or under the Crown’s inherentprerogative: doubt exists as to its source. Unlike the ordinary courts, the Courtof Star Chamber used torture. It became one of the most feared and powerfulweapons under the control of the Crown until its abolition in 1641. 
The King’s claim to dispense justice in his own right and without the
judges was dispelled in 1607. In Prohibitions Del Roy (Case of Prohibitions )
(1607), the King sought to settle a dispute concerning land. In the Resolutionof the Judges, Coke declared:
... it was answered by me, in the presence, and with the clear consent of all the
Judges of England, and Barons of the Exchequer, that the King in his ownperson cannot adjudge any case, either criminal, as treason, felony, etc, orbetwixt party and party, concerning his inheritance, chattels, or goods, etc, butthis ought to be determined and adjudged in some Court of Justice, accordingto the law and custom of England; and always judgments are given ... so thatthe Court gives the judgment ...
His Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England, and causes
which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his subjects arenot to be decided by natural reason [which the King claimed] but by theartificial reason and judgment of the law, which law is an art which requireslong study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognisance of it...
When, in 1617, the King ordered the Court of King’s Bench to adjourn
proceedings until he had been consulted, Chief Justice Coke refused, declaringthat:
Obedience to His Majesty’s command to stay proceedings would have been a
delay of justice, contrary to the law, and contrary to oaths of the judges.9
Coke was dismissed from the Bench. 
Whether a writ of habeas corpus would lie against the King was
determined in 1627. In Darnel’s Case (the Five Knights’ Case) (1627), it was held
that, where the King detained a prisoner under special order, the court would
not look behind the order. Thus, while the King could not determine cases, hecould nevertheless hold a subject free from interference by the judges. ThePetition of Right 1628 declared such power to be unlawful, and in 1640, theHabeas Corpus Act guaranteed that habeas corpus would lie against theCrown.

Regulation of trade and defence of the realm
Historically, much of the commerce and trade of the country was under the
prerogative of the Crown: according to Sir William Blackstone, the King ‘is thearbiter of commerce’ ( Commentaries ). But, if such a prerogative ever existed in
relation to foreign trade, it was effectively abolished by various statutes and,today, no commentator on the prerogative includes trade and commerce asbeing within its ambit. The King’s duty as to the protection of the realmencompassed the powers to restrict imports of the raw materials of war, andthe right to erect ports and havens. As Chitty observed, in 1820:
It is indisputably established, that the right to erect ports and havens is in
general vested exclusively in the Crown ...
The King has not merely the prerogative power of erecting ports and havens,
but he possesses prima facie the priority of ownership in all ports and havens
within his dominions, though the public have the right to use them; and eventhough the right to a port or haven be vested by charter or prescription in asubject, yet he holds it charged or affected with the jus regium or royal
prerogative, as it relates to ports and havens. [p 174]
As a corollary, the King had the prerogative power of erecting beacons and
lighthouses. Under statute, Elizabeth I vested power to erect beacons andlighthouses for the protection of seafarers in Trinity House at Deptford, butthe Act did not affect the King’s prerogative powers over beacons andlighthouses on the shores of non-coastal waters. 
The Crown and taxation
The early history of finance for the Crown is inextricably linked to the notionof the King as ultimate lord of all land. The King was the largest landowner inthe Kingdom and exercised his right to collect revenues from the land. Inaddition, the King received profits from legal proceedings in the form of feespaid by litigants and fines. Pardons were also sold. FW Maitland records thatin the twelfth century:
... the King’s revenue was the King’s revenue, no matter the source whence it
came; it was his to spend or to save, as pleased him best; all was his pocketmoney; it is to later times that we must look for any machinery for compellingthe King to spend his money upon national objects. [1908, p 94]
The granting of supply to the King by parliament from direct taxation had
been established in 1215, from which time it was accepted that the King hadno power to levy direct taxation without parliamentary consent.
10The
position of indirect taxation was, however, unclear. The power to regulatetrade, including the power to establish, open and close ports, was within theroyal prerogative. Accordingly, it could be argued that the correlative powerto levy taxes on imports and exports was within the power of the Crown. InChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
14010 In the reign of Edward I, 1271–1307.

The Royal Prerogative
Mary I’s reign, the Queen imposed indirect taxes on the exportation of cloth,
and, in Elizabeth I’s reign, a tax was imposed on the importation of wine. Alegal challenge to this assumed power of the Crown was instigated in JamesI’s reign (1603–25) over the increased taxation on currants. In Bate’s Case
(1606), the Court of Exchequer ruled in the King’s favour, accepting that:
The matter in question is a material matter of state, and ought to be ruled by
the rules of policy; and, if so, the King has done well to execute hisextraordinary powers. All customs, old or new, are effects of commerce withforeign nations; but commerce and affairs with foreigners, war and peace, theadmitting of foreign coin, all treaties whatsoever, are made by the absolutepower of the King. The King may shut the ports altogether; therefore he maytake toll at the ports.
The indirect taxation issue was again to be tried in the courts in the reign of
Charles I, from 1625 to 1649. In 1628, Charles had announced that in future allcounties would contribute towards the cost of the navy: the contribution beingeither in the form of the provision of ships or money in lieu thereof. In 1634,this scheme was put into effect, and thereafter Ship Money was leviedannually. Whilst this undoubtedly was within the King’s prerogative, itenabled the King to avoid the constitutional convention that there should beno taxation without parliament’s approval. In the Case of Ship Money (R v
Hampden) (1637) ,Hampden had refused to pay taxes levied by Charles I to
raise money for the navy in times of emergency. The King argued that it wasfor the Crown to determine whether or not an emergency situation existedand that this determination was conclusive of his right to exercise hisprerogative power to raise revenue. The courts upheld the power of theCrown:
The King pro bono publico may charge his subjects for the safety and defence of
the Kingdom, notwithstanding any Act of Parliament, and a statute derogatory
from the prerogative doth not bind the King and the King may dispense withany law in cases of necessity. 
... Acts of Parliament to take away his royal power in the defence of the
Kingdom are void; they are void Acts of Parliament to bind the King not tocommand the subjects, their persons and goods, and I say their money too; forno Acts of Parliament made any difference. [pp 826–1315]
The Shipmoney Act of 1640 reversed the decision, and Article IV of the Bill of
Rights 1689 declared it illegal for the Crown to raise money withoutparliamentary approval. The King’s power included the right to debase thecoinage,
11although Blackstone was doubtful whether such a power was
lawful.12Establishing markets for trading and granting monopolies over their
usage was within the King’s power, generating much income for the Crown.

12 Blackstone’s Commentaries . See, now, Coinage Act 1971 and Currency Act 1983.

Protest against Charles I’s reign by prerogative was fuelled by a rebellion
in Ireland, during which an estimated 2,000 English settlers were massacred.13
The Grand Remonstrance of 1641 listed the grievances of the country ruled
under the prerogative. The House of Commons, following debate, voted infavour of the Remonstrance by 159 votes to 148.
14
In 1685, James II inherited a Crown which was in debt. The question of
indirect taxation had not been fully resolved. James, though grantinggenerous sums for the army, requested an increased grant. When parliamentrefused, in 1685, James prorogued parliament. When James II fled to France in1688, the throne was offered to William and Mary of Orange under the termsset out in a Declaration of Right. Following acceptance of its terms, the Crownand Parliament Recognition Act 1689 was passed by the Conventionestablished to reach a settlement. Parliament, as then constituted, proceededto enact the Bill of Rights 1689, providing, inter alia, that there should be
regular meetings of parliament; that elections should be free; that the Crown’spower to raise taxation
15was subject to parliament’s approval, as was the
power to maintain an army; that the powers of suspending or dispensing withlaws by the Crown
16were illegal; and, of the greatest significance, that the
‘freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to beimpeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament’.
17
From this time, the supremacy of parliament over the Crown was
established and the prerogative powers of the Crown continued in existenceor were abolished or curtailed as parliament determined. No new prerogativepowers may be claimed by the Crown: as Diplock LJ stated in BBC v Johns
(1965): ‘... it is 350 years and a civil war too late for the Queen’s courts tobroaden the prerogative.’ 
Miscellaneous prerogatives 
Miscellaneous prerogatives included the right to raise revenue from thedemesne lands of the Crown as ‘lord paramount of the soil’,
18to the
ownership of tidal riverbeds, and to the land beneath a non-tidal riverbed –provided that it had not become a dry riverbed, whereupon the ownership ofthe soil is equally owned by the owners of the adjoining banks. Equally, theKing, by virtue of his prerogative, was owner of the shores – the land lyingbetween the high and low water mark – of seas and navigable rivers withinhis dominions. The ancient right of the King to wild creatures, to franchises offorest, ‘free chase’, park or free warren have been abolished

THE PREROGATIVE TODAY
The constitutional questions requiring answer include those relating to therelationship between statute and prerogative and the control, judicial orpolitical, of the prerogative. The most significant question which continues tointrigue and to concern constitutional theorists today relates to the veryexistence and scope of the powers themselves, together with the constitutionalimplications of this ill defined reservoir of power. As Maitland observed, andas remains true in the twenty-first century, examination of the prerogative is: 
... set about with difficulties, with prerogatives disused, with prerogatives of
doubtful existence, with prerogatives which exist by sufferance, merelybecause no one has thought it worthwhile to abolish them. [p 421]
Under the United Kingdom’s constitutional monarchy, the Queen is part of
the legislature: parliament comprises the Crown, Lords and Commons. TheQueen is the ‘fountain of justice’ – and while the Queen has no power to makelaws or suspend laws or to act in a judicial capacity,
21the entire
administration of justice is conducted in the name of the Crown. The Queen isSupreme Head of the Church of England.
22The Queen is head of state in
relation to foreign affairs. The Queen is head of the executive, and all acts ofgovernment, whether domestic or foreign, are conducted in the name of theCrown. The right to summon and dissolve parliament remains a legal powervested in the Crown. The Queen is the Fountain of Honour, and all honours inthe United Kingdom are conferred by the Crown. 
While regal powers are exercised in the name of the Crown by the
government of the day, the Crown nevertheless retains important residualpowers. Of these, the dissolution of parliament and the appointment of PrimeMinister are the most significant. These are discussed below. It must also berecognised that a few powers remain the personal prerogative of the Crown.Illustrations include the grant of honours such as the Order of Merit, and theOrders of the Garter and Thistle. More importantly, there still remains theprerogative notion that the Crown never dies and that the Crown is never aninfant (thus, ensuring continuity of monarchy), and that the Crown can ‘do nowrong’, thus placing the Queen outside the jurisdiction of the courts andguaranteeing immunity from prosecution in her own courts. Beyond these
14320 See MacMillan, 1996.

limited powers and immunities, the sovereign has, in the words of Bagehot
(1867): ‘... under a constitutional monarchy such as ours, three rights – theright to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.’ The influenceof the monarch should not be underestimated; this will be returned to below.
In legal theory, however, the position is much different. As Bagehot stated:
Not to mention other things, she could disband the army (by law, she cannot
engage more than a certain number of men, but she is not obliged to engageany men); she could dismiss all the officers, from the General Commander inChief downwards; she could dismiss all the sailors too; she could sell off allour ships of war and all our naval stores; she could make a peace by thesacrifice of Cornwall, and begin a war for the conquest of Brittany. She couldmake every parish in the United Kingdom a ‘university’; she could dismissmost of the civil servants; she could pardon all offenders. In a word, the Queencould by prerogative upset all the action of civil government within thegovernment, could disgrace the nation by a bad war or peace, and could, bydisbanding our forces, whether land or sea, leave us defenceless againstforeign nations. [(1867), 1993, ‘Introduction’ and pp 287–88]
On the other hand, FW Maitland observes:
There is one term against which I wish to warn you, and that is the term ‘thecrown’. You will certainly read that the crown does this and the crown doesthat. As a matter of fact, we know that the crown does nothing but lie in theTower of London to be gazed at by sightseers. [1908, p 418]
Maitland’s warning is apt, but cannot be taken at face value. The point being
made is that, in order to understand the power of the Crown, it is necessary tolook beyond the superficial phrase ‘in the name of the Crown’. The actualpower which is exercisable by the Crown is limited in two ways. First, byconvention, the majority of powers are exercised by Her Majesty’sgovernment or Her Majesty’s judges in her name. Secondly, the existence andscope of a purported prerogative power is subjected to the scrutiny of thecourts: ‘The King has no power save that allowed by law.’
23However, that
should not be considered as equivalent to a power to control theprerogative.
24
THE PREROGATIVE ILLUSTRATED 
Before examining the nature, scope and constitutional significance of theprerogative, some examples are necessary to indicate the areas of powerwhich fall under the prerogative. Under the United Kingdom’s unwrittenconstitution, there exists no formal and agreed text as to the prerogative. Inorder, therefore, to ascertain the contents of the prerogative, an examination ofthe historical attributes of the Crown and the attitude of the courts to theChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Royal Prerogative
prerogative is required. It is paradoxical – but undeniable – in a modern
democracy, that there is no comprehensive, authoritative ‘catalogue’ ofprerogative powers.
25
To make an analysis of prerogative powers manageable, they may be
separated into two categories:26those relating to foreign affairs and those
relating to domestic affairs. Under foreign affairs can be subsumed:
• the power to make declarations of war and peace;
• power to enter into treaties;• the recognition of foreign states;• diplomatic relations; and• disposition of the armed forces overseas. 
Within the domestic category falls:
• the summoning and dissolution of parliament; • appointment of ministers;• royal assent to Bills; • the granting of honours; • defence of the realm;• the keeping of the peace; • the parens patriae jurisdiction of the courts; 
• the power to stop criminal prosecutions – nolle prosequi;
• the prerogative of mercy;• reduction of sentences; • pardoning of offenders; • regulation of the terms and conditions of the Civil Service; and • the right to royal fish and swans.
27
It can be seen from this list, which is by no means exhaustive, that the powers
are wide and diverse.
THE PREROGATIVE AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
The dissolution of parliament
The dissolution of parliament refers to the process by which an existingparliament is brought to an end with a new parliament coming into beingfollowing a general election. The dissolution of parliament lies within the
14525 The most recent authoritative account remains that of Chitty, 1820.
26 As does Blackstone, in his Commentaries .
27 A right expressly preserved by the Wild Creatures and Forest Laws Act 1971. Formerly,
the right to treasure trove also vested in the Crown: Attorney General of Duchy of
Lancaster v GE Overton (Farms) Ltd (1982). The right to treasure trove is now regulated
by the Treasure Act 1996. Treasure found must be reported within 14 days to the local
coroner. Failure to do so will be a criminal offence. A Treasure Valuation Committeehas been established which has the duty to value treasure and advise on ex gratia
payments to the finder.

prerogative of the Crown. It is perhaps the most important residual
prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatestpotential for controversy. Three aspects of the right to dissolve parliamentrequire consideration: first, whether the Crown has the right to dissolveparliament on its own initiative; secondly, whether the Crown has the right torefuse a dissolution when requested by the Prime Minister or other ministers;and thirdly, whether, by refusing to assent to a Bill contrary to the advice ofthe Prime Minister, the Crown can indirectly force a dissolution.
Royal dissolution on the initiative of the Crown
The last occasion on which the Crown – on its own initiative – dissolvedparliament was in 1835. The dismissal of his government by William IV in1834–35 reveals the constitutional dangers of the exercise of monarchicalpower. The government had lost its leader, but was nonetheless viable as acontinuing ministry. The King, misjudging the strength of public opinionagainst the government, forced it out of office only to be replaced by anunsuccessful successor. Bagehot evaluates the 1834–35 situation thus:
So that the last precedent for a royal onslaught on a ministry ended thus: in
opposing the right principles, in aiding the wrong principles, in hurting theparty it was meant to help. After such a warning, it is likely that our monarchswill pursue the policy which a long course of quiet precedent at present directs– they will leave a ministry trusted by Parliament to the judgment ofParliament. [(1867), 1993, p 231]
It has been suggested that ‘a royal dissolution in our times would not merely
be unpolitical; it would also be unconstitutional’.28This view has the support
of Sir Ivor Jennings, who argues that, since the dissolution involves ‘theacquiescence of ministers’,
29the Queen is accordingly unable to achieve a
dissolution without advice. In Jennings’s view, ‘if ministers refuse to give suchadvice, she can do no more than dismiss them’.
30The matter cannot be left
there, however, for uncertainty remains over this issue. Walter Bagehot,writing in 1867, observed that the Crown’s power to dissolve parliament,other than following a Prime Ministerial request, ‘has almost, if not quite,dropped out of the reality of our Constitution’ (p 230). Bagehot continued:
Nothing, perhaps, would more surprise the English people than if the Queen
by a coup d’etat and of a sudden destroyed a ministry firm in the allegiance and
secure of a majority in Parliament. That power, indisputably, in theory,belongs to her; but it has passed so far away from the minds of men that itwould terrify them, if she used it, like a volcanic eruption from Primrose Hill.Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
14628 Markesinis, 1972, p 115; see, also, Marshall, 1984, Chapter III.
29 In so far as an Order in Council is required, the Lord President of the Council must
summon the Council and a Proclamation and writs of summons must be issued, for
which the Lord Chancellor has responsibility.
30 Jennings, 1959a, p 413.

The Royal Prerogative
Dicey was of a different view. In Dicey’s judgment, the Crown has the right –
in extreme circumstances – to ‘dismiss a ministry who commands aparliamentary majority, and to dissolve the parliament by which the ministryare supported’ ((1898), 1959, p 433). Dicey continued:
The prerogative, in short, of dissolution may constitutionally be so employed
as to override the will of the representative body, or, as it is popularly called,‘The People’s House of Parliament’. This looks at first sight like saying that incertain cases the prerogative can be so used as to set at nought the will of thenation. But in reality it is far otherwise. The discretionary power of the Crownoccasionally may be, and according to constitutional precedents sometimesought to be, used to strip an existing House of Commons of its authority. Butthe reason why the House can in accordance with the constitution be deprivedof power and of existence is that an occasion has arisen on which there is fairreason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of theelectors. A dissolution is in its essence an appeal from the legal to the politicalsovereign. A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of thelegislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes ofthe nation.
Dicey recognised, however, that the dissolution of 1834–35 was ‘a mistake’,
the King wrongly interpreting the will of the nation. That judgment is notconclusive of the constitutionality of the King’s action, although Diceyconceded that it ‘is hard to speak with decision’ over that dissolution. AsDicey argued, if there is a constitutional right to appeal directly to the peopleby dissolving parliament, then that right cannot itself be defeated merelybecause of a mistaken judgment. The precedent of 1834
31is cited as authority
for the proposition that the Crown has the right to dissolve parliament, otherthan on the advice of ministers, where the main objective of dissolution is to‘ascertain that the will of parliament coincides with the will of the nation’(Dicey, p 435).
Whatever may be the answer given by historians to this inquiry, the
precedents of 1784 and 1834 are decisive; they determine the principle onwhich the prerogative of dissolution ought to be exercised, and show that inmodern times the rules as to the dissolution of Parliament are, like otherconventions of the constitution, intended to secure the ultimate supremacy ofthe electorate as the true political sovereign of the state; that, in short, thevalidity of constitutional maxims is subordinate and subservient to thefundamental principle of popular sovereignty. [Dicey, p 437]
Queen Victoria (1837–1901) was in little doubt that she retained the power to
dissolve parliament without the advice of her ministers. Lord Salisburysummarised the consequences of such use of the prerogative:
A dissolution by the Queen, against the advice of her ministers, would, of
course, involve their resignation. Their party could hardly help going to thecountry as the opponents of the royal authority; or, at least, as the severe crisisof the mode in which it had been exerted ... There must be some hazard that, in
14731 And the earlier precedent of 1784, when George III dissolved parliament.

the end, such a step would injure the authority of the Queen. It ought not,
therefore, to be taken unless there is an urgent reason for taking it. No suchreason exists at present. It may ultimately be necessary in order to escape froma deadlock.
32
Whether such a power continues to exist as a practical reality is, accordingly,
in doubt. However, in so far as prerogatives continue in existence untilexpressly abolished by parliament, in legal-theoretical terms, Dicey’s viewwould appear to be correct. There are, however, principled objections to thisposition. The power of control over the executive lies within parliament andthe parliamentary process. With the parliamentary process of government andopposition functioning correctly, there should never be a situation arising inwhich an exercise of prerogative power would become necessary. A situationin which the Crown felt obliged to protect the ‘sovereignty of the people’against its democratically elected parliament would represent an extremeparadox. 
Refusal of dissolution on Prime Ministerial request
Two illustrations of refusal of a dissolution can be drawn from theCommonwealth. In 1926, the Governor General of Canada refused adissolution to the Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, who resigned. TheGovernor General wrongly believed that the Leader of the Opposition couldform a viable government with the support of parliament. After only fourdays in office, the incoming government was defeated and the Prime Ministerrequested, and was granted, a dissolution. A similar situation arose in 1939 inSouth Africa. In each case, the Governor General was much criticised. It is,however, by no means clear whether the position of a Governor General isidentical to that of the Crown. A Governor General is appointed by theCrown, on the advice of Commonwealth ministers, for a fixed term of office.Once appointed, the Governor General acts on the advice of Commonwealthministers. His position is therefore not identical to that of the monarch, and itcannot be assumed that the precedents of 1926 and 1939 can be invokedunqualifiedly to demonstrate the position of the Queen.

Professor Markesinis questions whether the Crown retains the right – if it
ever existed – to refuse a dissolution on the request of a Prime Minister. Onthe other hand, he states that:
... no one in particular was or is quite sure whether a convention has emerged
that virtually allows the Prime Minister a free hand in the matter. [1972, p 116]
What does appear clear is that the Crown – if it is to exercise this personal
prerogative – must at least have the support of some ministers.34The claim
that the advice on which the Crown acts to dissolve parliament is PrimeChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Royal Prerogative
Ministerial advice appears to derive only from 1918.35However, the situation
could arise whereby the Prime Minister wishes a dissolution to take place, but
other ministers do not. The Queen would then have to exercise a personalchoice. In this regard, Geoffrey Marshall, cites The Times newspaper’s editorial
view, expressed in relation to the Labour government of 1966–70:
If a Prime Minister defeated in Cabinet, unable to carry his policy in the party
meeting, were to ask for a dissolution for the apparent purpose ofunnecessarily involving his party in his own downfall, the Queen would haveample grounds for refusing and dismissing him, provided an alternativeleader of the majority party was in sight. [1984, p 46]
It is arguable that if there is no discretion remaining, then the prerogative is at
least in abeyance, or at most, is no longer truly a prerogative power.36It could
be argued, alternatively, that the supposed convention that the responsibilityof the Prime Minister for the exercise of this prerogative is no true conventionat all. As Geoffrey Marshall puts it:
It can be argued that it lacks the essential quality that should mark a
constitutional convention, namely the combination of consistent historicalprecedents, and a convincing raison d’être. [1984, p 45]
Sir Ivor Jennings was of the opinion that, while ‘the Queen’s personal
prerogative is maintained in theory, it can hardly be exercised in practice’(1959a, p 426).
Dissolution following refusal of the royal assent
A ‘forced’ dissolution would inevitably come about if the Queen were torefuse to assent to a Bill against the wishes of her Prime Minister. During theHome Rule for Ireland debate, King George V (1910–36) was encouraged toveto the Home Rule Bill (see Chapter 3 on Home Rule). In legal theory, theQueen has the right to refuse her assent to Bills, but by convention, assent isalways given. The right to refuse assent has not been exercised since the reignof Queen Anne in 1704. George V, however, believed that he had the power torefuse assent to the Irish Home Rule Bill under the Parliament Act 1911 in1913 and 1914.
37In relation to this, Sir Ivor Jennings states that:
It was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power
but the constitutional right to refuse assent. On the other hand, he recognisedthat his exercise of the power would involve the resignation of ministers, adissolution of Parliament, and a general election in which the main issuewould be the prerogatives of the Crown. There is something to be said for apower to dismiss an unconstitutional ministry or to dissolve a corruptParliament, but nothing to be said for a power to refuse assent to a Bill becausethe King thinks it wrong. [1959a, p 400]

36 Following Blackstone’s view that for a prerogative to exist it must be a power unique to
the Crown.
37 Jennings, 1959a, Chapter XIII.

Doubt exists as to whether the Queen can refuse the royal assent, dissolve
parliament against the government’s will, and dismiss the government. Nogovernment has been dismissed by the Crown since 1783, although thequestion arose in 1913–14 over the issue of Irish Home Rule, and the right todismiss ministers was claimed to exist by George V, but not exercised. Sir IvorJennings states that:
The Queen’s function is ... to see that the constitution functions in the normal
manner. It functions in the normal manner so long as the electors are asked todecide between competing parties at intervals of reasonable length. She wouldbe justified in refusing to assent to a policy which subverted the democraticbasis of the constitution, by unnecessary or indefinite prolongations of the lifeof Parliament, by a gerrymandering of the constituencies in the interests of oneparty, or by fundamental modifications of the electoral system to the same end.She would not be justified in other circumstances; and certainly the Kingwould not have been justified in 1913. [1959a, pp 403, 407–12]
On this alleged right to withhold assent to Bills, Geoffrey Marshall speculates
as to whether the Queen could refuse to follow the advice of ministers if aPrivate Members’ Bill was approved by both Houses but opposed bygovernment, and whether, if parliament approved a Bill in a manner requiredby procedural rules, the Queen could refuse assent – but there is no definitiveanswer to these questions (see Marshall, 1984, pp 21–23).
As can be seen, many doubts surround the prerogative of the dissolution
of parliament. It is claimed nowadays that, whilst the dissolution ofparliament is technically for the Queen, it is exclusively within the PrimeMinister’s domain to request a dissolution at a time of his or her choice. Thisalleged exclusivity of Prime Ministerial – rather than Cabinet – choice stemsonly from the 1920s. Until 1918, when the convention was first challenged, itwas thought that the decision rested with Cabinet. However, in 1935, PrimeMinister Baldwin asserted his independent right to decide on the date ofdissolution, resulting in criticism that the Prime Minister had unilaterallyincreased the importance of the Prime Ministerial office by assuming thediscretionary power of the Crown.
38Sir Ivor Jennings states that:
No dissolution since 1918 has been brought before the Cabinet, and all Prime
Ministers since Mr Lloyd George have assumed the right to give the advice.[1959a, p 419]
Geoffrey Marshall doubts the accuracy of this assertion, citing 1950, 1966 and
1970 as dates on which the Cabinet was consulted before a decision wasreached, whilst also citing Harold Wilson’s statement that ‘there is noobligation on the Prime Minister to consult’.
39
While, for the most part, the timing of a dissolution will be within the
Prime Minister’s discretion, there may arise situations where the Crown mayChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Royal Prerogative
have a constitutional duty to exercise its powers. By way of example, a
minority government – shortly after a general election – might form a pactwith an opposition party on whose co-operation it depended for a workingmajority in parliament. If, as a result of political disagreement, the pact brokedown and the opposition party united with other opposition parties, theresultant situation would cause the Prime Minister either to resign or to seek adissolution of parliament in order to test the support of the electorate.However, if the newly combined opposition parties had a leader who couldcommand a majority in the House of Commons, it is by no means certain thatthe Queen would grant the dissolution requested. The Queen would, in effect,be confronted by two opposing constitutional principles. The first of these isthat the dissolution of parliament is a matter for the Prime Minister andaccordingly must be granted. The second principle is that the Queen shouldappoint as Prime Minister the leader of that party – or parties – which couldcommand a majority in the House of Commons. In such a situation, theCrown clearly would have to exercise its powers of decision making, andmight, in the interests of continuity of parliament and the avoidance ofanother general election, refuse a dissolution and call the leader of theopposition parties to form a government.
40
The Labour government of 1974 reveals the potential difficulties and
uncertainties concerning the power of dissolution. It also reveals the inherentvagueness in the concept of votes of confidence following the loss of whichgovernments – by convention – are expected to seek a dissolution ofparliament. The general election resulted in the Labour Party holding 301 (37per cent) seats, the Conservative Party 297 (38 per cent), the Liberal Party 14and the other parties 23 seats. The Labour Party was accordingly 34 seats shortof an overall majority.
41Given the indeterminate election result, neither the
Labour Party nor Conservative Party was keen for there to be a dissolution inthe near future. The Labour government accordingly made it clear that adefeat in the Commons would not force the government to seek a dissolution,other than where the government had made it clear to all members of theHouse that it was treating the matter as one of confidence. Between Marchand October 1974, the government suffered 17 defeats in the Commons.
42A
general election took place in October 1974 when the opinion polls appearedfavourable to Labour. The resulting election results produced an overallmajority of three seats for the Labour Party.
43
Between 1977 and 1978, the Labour government entered into a pact with
the Liberal Party. While the Labour Party had won a narrow overall majorityin the general election of October 1974, by 1976 this majority had been lost.
15140 See Marshall, 1984, Chapter III; on this specific point, see Brazier, 1982.
41 See Butler, 1989, Chapter II.42 Between October 1974 and March 1979, the government was defeated 42 times, three of
which were defeats on matters central to government policy.
43 Labour 319, Conservative 277, Liberal 13, others 26.

Having failed to reach agreement with the Ulster Unionist Party, the Prime
Minister, James Callaghan, entered negotiations with the Liberal Party leader,David Steel, out of which the ‘Lib-Lab Pact’ was born. The pact did notamount to a coalition government; no Liberals held government posts, norwas the government committed to accommodate Liberal policy within itslegislative programme. Despite the government’s lack of a majority (from1976) and its dependency on the Liberal Party for its survival in office, theParty asserted the constitutional right of the Prime Minister – and no one else– to determine the dissolution of parliament. The matter should not beregarded as so certain. SA de Smith and R Brazier have written:
Perhaps the following proposition would command a wide measure of
support: the Queen may properly refuse a Prime Minister’s request for adissolution if she has substantial grounds for believing (i) that an alternativegovernment, enjoying the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons,can be formed without a general election, and (ii) that a general election held atthat time would be clearly prejudicial to the national interest. [1994, p 129 (see,now, 8th edn, 1998)]
An illustration from the Republic of Ireland
There is no precedent within the United Kingdom from which firm
conclusions can be drawn. However, in the Republic of Ireland, the matter hasbeen tested. In November 1994, following a controversial appointment of aformer Attorney General (Harry Whelehan) to the position of President of theHigh Court, the 22 month coalition government of Fianna Fail and the Labour
Party collapsed. Article 13.2.2 of the Constitution provides that:
The President44may in his absolute discretion refuse to dissolve Dail Eireann
on the advice of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority
in Dail Eireann .
It is also clear, however, that the President cannot refuse a dissolution to aPrime Minister who retains the support of a majority in the parliament ( Dail).
Three possible solutions could be sought. First, the President could grant adissolution on Prime Ministerial request and a general election would takeplace. Secondly, the opposition parties could try to form a coalition and thePresident appoint its leader as Prime Minister. Thirdly, the Fianna Fail (the
governing party) ministers could replace the Prime Minister with anotherleader who could secure a continued coalition government, in which caseneither a dissolution nor a general election would be required. Should thePrime Minister (the Taoiseach) lose majority support by losing a formal vote of
confidence, he would be obliged to resign.

Minister, Dick Spring, announced that he would vote against the PrimeMinister, Albert Reynolds, in a vote of confidence, the Prime Ministerresigned.Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Royal Prerogative
On 15 December, after five weeks of political turmoil, John Bruton, Leader
of the Fine Gael Party, with the support of the Labour and Democratic Left
Party, was elected Prime Minister. The new coalition government had a
majority of four in the Dail. Dick Spring, Leader of the Labour Party, was
reappointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.46Thus, the
second option had been favoured and a new government – albeit fragile –formed without a dissolution of the Dail. 
An illustration from Australia
The Australian political crisis in 1975 provides a further example of thisuncertain constitutional situation.
47Under section 2 of the Commonwealth of
Australia Constitution Act 1900, the Governor General:
... shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen’s
pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of theQueen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him. 
Section 5 states that:
The Governor General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of theParliament as he thinks fit, and may also from time to time, by proclamation orotherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in like manner dissolve theHouse of Representatives.
Section 64 provides that:
The Governor General may appoint officers to administer such Departments ofState of the Commonwealth as the Governor General in Council may establish.Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General.
In October 1975, the Senate refused supply to the government by resolving not
to proceed with legislation giving effect to the Labour government’s financialprogramme until the government agreed to a general election for the House ofRepresentatives. When the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, refused to accedeto this demand, supply was denied. On 11 November 1975 the Prime Ministercalled on the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, to request that writs be issuedfor elections to be held for 50 per cent of the Senate seats. Rather than grantingthe writs, the Governor General informed the Prime Minister that hiscommission had been withdrawn. In so doing – among other things – theGovernor General prevented the Prime Minister from telephoning the Queen,as was his right whilst in office. Subsequently, the Governor General called forthe Opposition Leader to act as caretaker Prime Minister, subject to twoconditions. The first related to ensuring the granting of supply; the second toadvising the Governor General to dissolve both Houses. In the ensuinggeneral election the Opposition Leader, Malcolm Fraser, was returned with amajority of seats and the impasse ended.
15346The Times , 16 December 1994.
47 Sawer, 1977.

One cause of the problem was the constitution itself, for while ministers
must be in the lower House – the House of Representatives – the Senate had
been given the power to withhold finance from a ministry formed from theHouse of Representatives. Compare this situation with the pre-1911 positionof the House of Lords in the United Kingdom whereby – by convention – theHouse of Lords traditionally gave way to the Commons on matters of supply,and now the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which regulate the position. InAustralia, there had been no serious conflict until the situation of 1975.
48
The intervention of – and actions of – the Governor General was much
criticised, and whilst acting within his constitutional powers, the GovernorGeneral was seen to be directly involved in a political controversy. Thecriticisms were the greater for the fact that, in so acting, he was dismissing aLabour Prime Minister and the ministry of the House of Representatives andwas seen to be favouring the upper House.
49
David Butler identified four questions implicit in the crises of 1975, two of
which have immediate relevance: 
(1) What should the Queen have done if Mr Whitlam had the chance to
‘phone her to demand the instant dismissal of the Governor General?
(2) Is ‘the Governor General in Council’ the only power that can dissolve
Parliament, necessarily the Governor General and ministers of the Crown:
or could the Governor General have called an Executive Council composedof Councillors not currently ‘on summons’ as ministers?
To neither of these questions were answers forthcoming to David Butler in his
discussions.50More than anything else, the Australian saga reveals that the
constitutional position of the monarch – in the representative form of aGovernor General – can be as uncertain under a written constitution as undera largely unwritten one.
Circumstances requiring dissolution
Loss of confidence vote
By convention, a government must resign or seek a dissolution of parliamentfrom the Queen if a confidence vote is lost in the House of Commons. A voteof confidence was described by Prime Minister Ramsey MacDonald in 1924 asbeing a vote on ‘substantial issues, issues of principle, issues which reallymatter, a matter which strikes at the root of proposals made’. In 1979, theLabour government had been defeated by two votes in a vote over itseconomic policy. The then Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Margaret Thatcher,said that:Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

49 Hanks, 1991, p 164.
50 Butler, 1976.

The Royal Prerogative
The government has been decisively defeated and discredited on a matter
central to their whole economic policy. Such a defeat is unprecedented inmodern times.
In the light of the decision of the House of Commons, I call upon the
government to resign or seek a vote of confidence forthwith.
The Prime Minister, James Callaghan, tabled a vote of confidence and won the
vote. Nevertheless, in light of the political uncertainty, the Prime Ministersought and was granted a dissolution, and a general election followed atwhich the Labour Party was defeated.
During the first term of the incoming Conservative government’s tenure of
office, many ‘votes of no confidence’ were tabled (put down) by theOpposition, yet none led to a dissolution of parliament.
THE APPOINTMENT OF PRIME MINISTER
In constitutional theory, the Queen – under the royal prerogative – mayappoint whomsoever she pleases to the office of Prime Minister.
51In practice,
the position is governed by convention and the Queen must appoint theperson who can command a majority in the House of Commons; this, undernormal circumstances, will be the leader of the political party which securesthe greatest number of parliamentary seats at a general election.
52Several
differing situations present themselves: the government of the day may bereturned by the electorate with a majority and the Prime Minister will remainin office. Alternatively, the government may lose the election, and theincoming Prime Minister will be the leader of that political party whichcommands a majority of seats in the House of Commons. More difficult is theposition where the election produces no outright winner, resulting in no oneparty having an overall majority. Here, the spectre of a ‘hung parliament’arises. The situation may also arise where a Prime Minister resigns from oldage or ill health during the course of his term of office – as was the case in 1935(Ramsey MacDonald), 1955 (Winston Churchill) and 1957 (Anthony Eden) –or dies in office (Campbell-Bannerman, 1905–08). Finally, it may be the casethat a Prime Minister chooses to retire, as occurred in 1937 (Stanley Baldwin)and 1976 (Harold Wilson).
Appointment of Prime Minister following a general election
Where general elections are involved, for the most part, as will be seen later,the electoral system in the United Kingdom returns a single party with an

52 Under the Prime Minister (Office, Role and Functions) Bill 2001, the power of
appointment is placed on a statutory basis. See, further, p 175.

overall majority, and so no question arises as to whom the Queen should
appoint as Prime Minister. It is not out of the question, however, for adifferent political scenario to present itself. Should the Queen send for theleader of the party having the largest number of seats, or the leader of theparty which will hold the balance of power? There is much debate over thisissue,
53but once again no clear cut answer.
In February 1974, the Conservative Party lost the general election by a
small number of seats and could command no overall majority in the Houseof Commons. Following the election results, the Prime Minister, EdwardHeath, did not tender his resignation immediately but rather entered intonegotiations over the following weekend with the Liberal Party, with a viewto forming a political pact which would ensure a majority over the oppositionparties. When those negotiations broke down, Mr Heath immediatelyresigned, and the Queen invited the Leader of the Labour Party to becomePrime Minister. The question arising at the time was whether there had beenany unconstitutional conduct involved in Mr Heath not relinquishing officethe moment the election results were known.
54The answer would appear to
be that Mr Heath had the constitutional right to attempt to form a coalitionwhich would avoid the need for a further election. 
Appointment of Prime Minister following retirement of the
incumbent
When the Prime Minister retires, the government still retains the mandate of
the people and hence the choice of the new Prime Minister will be dictated bythe wishes of the Party. It may be that there is a ‘Prime Minister in waiting’who commands the support of the Party and will hence be appointed withoutdelay. Under such circumstances, it is unrealistic to speak of the Crownhaving any choice in the matter. Where no Party consensus as to a successorexists, the political process will come into play. Nowadays, each of the majorpolitical parties utilises a method of election of its leader, and it is that processwhich will determine the successor: again, the Queen has no practical ‘say’ inthe matter. It was not always thus. 
In 1957, Sir Anthony Eden resigned office, and there was no obvious
successor – nor was there in place at that time an electoral process within thegoverning Conservative Party which would produce a successor. The Queenwas thus left with a choice. The Queen consulted elder statesmen of theConservative Party and acted upon their advice that Harold Macmillan beappointed. Had she not acted upon impartial advice, the Crown could havebeen damaged by charges of political decision making. One consequence ofChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
15653 See, inter alia , Jennings, 1959a, Chapter II; Marshall, 1984, pp 29–35; Marshall and
Moodie, 1971, pp 44–51; Brazier, 1982.
54 See, inter alia , Bogdanor, 1983, Chapters 5–8; Butler, 1983.

The Royal Prerogative
the 1957 dilemma was that the Labour Party announced its intention to
introduce a selection procedure for its leader: a move designed to remove anydiscretion from the Crown. The Conservative Party did not react in thismanner until after the difficulties revealed in 1963. The resignation of HaroldMacmillan fell at a time when there were several contenders for leadership ofthe Party. The matter was resolved by the appointment of Lord Home, aConservative peer who relinquished his peerage and took a seat in the Houseof Commons as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. However, the saga emphasised theuncertainties in the choice of Party Leader and an electoral system for theleadership of the Party was subsequently introduced. 
In 1976, Harold Wilson resigned office. In The Governance of Britain , Wilson
describes the theory and practice in the handover of power:
In the relatively simple handover of what is in fact, though not
constitutionally, a continuing government, the test, given the normalcircumstances of a party majority, is whether A or B can in fact command amajority in the House of Commons. Where the party’s procedure for selectinga leader is laid down and is seen to have worked, for example, the eliminatingballot procedure used by the Parliamentary Labour Party in March–April 1976,the selection is fairly clear, though it still has to be made. The ParliamentaryParty was not in fact electing a Prime Minister; it was electing a new partyleader.
When the process is complete, the outgoing Prime Minister goes straight to the
Palace and formally tenders his resignation; the most he needs to do is toinform the monarch, who will have been given the figures already, that theballot has produced a given result, probably adding that, in his view, thenewly elected leader can command a majority in Parliament ...
Contrary to widespread belief, there is no duty on the Prime Minister, still less
any inherent right, to recommend the man to be sent for. It is the sovereign who
decides whom to send for and invite to form a government .
55
THE PREROGATIVE OF MERCY
Nowadays, the prerogative of mercy entails two aspects: the power to grant
pardons which in turn has two elements and the power to enter a nolle
prosequi . 
Pardons and commutation of sentence
A complete pardon is used to remove the ‘pains, penalties and punishments’which flow from a conviction for a criminal offence, but does not eliminate theconviction itself.
56The right of pardon does not extend to civil matters. The
power is exercisable in England and Wales on the advice of the Secretary of
15755 Wilson, 1976, pp 21–22, emphasis added.
56R v Foster (1985).

State for the Home Department, who is accountable to parliament. The Crown
therefore has no personal involvement in its exercise. Commutation ofsentence is a limited – or conditional – form of pardon. The sentence will bereduced on conditions: ‘... a condemned murderer is pardoned on condition ofhis going into penal servitude.’ As Maitland comments (1908, p 480): ‘It is anice question whether he might not insist on being hanged.’ Commutation isdistinguishable from remission of sentence. The latter reduces the sentenceimposed but does not alter its form. 
RFV Heuston, writing in 1964, examined the unusual situation which
arose in 1948. The Criminal Justice Bill included a clause – accepted by theCommons on amendment – abolishing the death penalty for a period of fiveyears. The government was clear that the House of Lords would reject theamendment. The Home Secretary announced that he proposed to advise theCrown ‘to exercise the prerogative of mercy in every case of the deathsentence being pronounced until a definite decision had been come to byParliament’ (Heuston, p 7). In debate in the House of Lords, Lord Goddard CJtook the view that the proposal of the Home Secretary came close to ‘being anexercise of the suspending and dispensing powers claimed by the Stuarts andprohibited by the Bill of Rights’. In Heuston’s view, the dispensing andsuspending powers are distinguishable from the power of pardon: the formeraffects the legality of the act, the latter simply ‘frees a guilty person from thelegal consequences of his admittedly illegal act’ (p 71).
The prerogative of mercy has traditionally been regarded as unreviewable
by the courts. In 1976, in De Freitas v Benny (1976), Lord Diplock was to state
that: 
At common law, this has always been a matter which lies solely in the
discretion of the sovereign, who by constitutional convention exercises it inrespect of England on the advice of the Home Secretary to whom Her Majestydelegates her discretion. Mercy is not the subject of legal rights. It begins wherelegal rights end.
57
In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (1985), Lord
Roskill confirmed that the prerogative of mercy was not ‘susceptible to
judicial review’. (For further discussion of this case, see below, p 169.)However, as will be seen further below, the review of the prerogative is not astatic matter, and is one which evolves over time. Judicial doubt on refusal toreview the prerogative was expressed in the New Zealand Court of Appeal inBurt v Governor General (1992). In that case, while the court ruled that, in light
of the safeguards which existed under the New Zealand criminal justicesystem, there was in the instant case no good reason to review the exercise ofthe prerogative of mercy; nevertheless, the court stated that ‘it would beinconsistent with the contemporary approach to say that, merely because it isa pure and strict prerogative power, its exercise or non-exercise must beimmune from curial challenge’ (p 678). Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
15857 At p 247. See, also, R v Allen (1862); Hanratty v Lord Butler (1971).

The Royal Prerogative
The case of Bentley (1993) illustrates the contemporary position regarding
the review of the prerogative of mercy in the United Kingdom. In 1952, Derek
Bentley, aged 19, and with a mental age of an 11 year old, was convicted of themurder of a policeman. At the time, the death penalty was the mandatorysentence for murder. Derek Bentley was hanged in 1953, a mere three monthsafter the murder. His co-defendant, Christopher Craig, who fired the fatal shotat the police officer who died, was also convicted of murder, but escapedexecution because he was aged only 16. Despite a recommendation by the jurythat mercy be exercised, the Home Secretary decided not to exercise theprerogative. In 1992, the then Home Secretary refused to recommend aposthumous free pardon on the grounds that, while he personally agreed withthe view that the death sentence should not have been carried out, it was thelong established policy of Home Secretaries not to grant a free pardon unlessthe person concerned was both ‘morally and technically innocent’ of anycrime and that his review of the case did not establish Bentley’s innocence. Inan application for judicial review brought by Derek Bentley’s family, the courtconsidered the question whether the prerogative of mercy was amenable tojudicial review.
58The applicant sought a declaration that the Home Secretary
had erred in law in declining to recommend a posthumous free pardon, andmandamus to require the Home Secretary to reconsider the matter. 
Counsel for the Home Secretary argued that the exercise of the royal
prerogative of mercy was not reviewable in the instant case, on the basis thatthe criteria upon which the pardon should be granted was a question ofpolicy, which was not justiciable. Counsel for the applicant argued that theprerogative of mercy is an important feature of the criminal justice system,and that ‘it would be surprising and regrettable ... were the decision of theHome Secretary to be immune from legal challenge irrespective of the gravityof the legal errors which infected such a decision’ (p 452 per Watkins LJ). The
court ruled that the view that ‘the formulation of the criteria for the exercise ofthe prerogative by the grant of a free pardon was entirely a matter of policywhich is not justiciable’ was ‘probably right’ (p 453). However, it ruled thatthe Home Secretary failed to recognise that the prerogative of mercy is‘capable of being exercised in many different circumstances and over a widerange’, and should have considered the form of pardon which might beappropriate to the facts of the case. This the Home Secretary did not do, andthis failure was reviewable by the courts. The court, citing Burt v Governor
General, endorsed the view that the prerogative of mercy is now ‘aconstitutional safeguard against mistakes’. The court also ruled, however, thatit had no power to direct the way in which the prerogative of mercy should beexercised, but that it had a role to play by way of judicial review. The courtdeclined to make any formal order, but invited the Home Secretary toreconsider the matter ‘in light of the now generally accepted view that thisyoung man should have been reprieved’ (p 455).
15958R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Bentley (1993).

In 1998, the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, on a reference by the
Criminal Cases Review Commission under section 9 of the Criminal Appeal
Act 1995, quashed Derek Bentley’s conviction for murder. In a powerfuljudgment, the Court of Appeal criticised a number of aspects of Bentley’s trial.In particular, the court ruled that the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard,had failed to direct the jury adequately on the standard of proof to be met;had, in effect, reversed the burden of proof from the prosecution to thedefence; had shown partiality to the police evidence over that of the defence;that the summing up by the Lord Chief Justice represented ‘a highly rhetoricaland strongly worded denunciation of both defendants and their defence’; andthat, by failing adequately to direct the jury on the law then in force as to ‘jointenterprises’, the judge had ‘failed to grapple with that ground of appeal’,which should have succeeded. As a result, the effect was to deprive Bentley ofthe protection which jury trial should have afforded: ‘The summing up herewas such as to deny Bentley that fair trial which was the birthright of everyBritish citizen.’ The Court of Appeal ruled that the conviction had beenunsafe, and the conviction for murder was quashed ( R v Bentley (1998)). Thus,
45 years after the event, Bentley’s name was cleared by the courts on the basisthat his conviction had been unsafe, the royal prerogative of mercy in thehands of the politicians having failed to provide a remedy. 
Nolle prosequi
On proceedings on indictment, the Attorney General, in the name of theCrown, can enter a nolle prosequi ,the effect of which stops the legal
proceedings. The power is not subject to the control of the courts: R v
Comptroller of Patents (1899). The grant of a nolle prosequi does not amount to an
acquittal, and accordingly, the accused may be brought before the court on thesame charge. The effect of this would be to invite a further application for anolle prosequi. 
POWER TO ESTABLISH NON-STATUTORY AGENCIES
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was established under theprerogative in 1964. Its objective was to provide compensation for the victimsof criminal offences
59through ex gratia payments calculated on the same
principles as compensation paid to victims of tort. The Board wasreconstituted under statute in 1988,
60although the provisions had not been
brought into force. Was the setting up of the Board in 1964 the exercise of atrue prerogative? Reverting to Blackstone’s definition, the answer must benegative. The power to establish such a scheme clearly fell within parliament’sChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
16059 See Newburn, 1989.
60 Criminal Justice Act 1988, ss 108–17 and Scheds 6–7.

The Royal Prerogative
jurisdiction, as the Criminal Justice Act 1988 proves. However, under Dicey’s
definition, the government is effectively given a choice in the manner ofestablishing such bodies: a surely questionable prerogative? In R v Criminal
Injuries Board ex parte Lain (1967), Lord Diplock stated:
It may be a novel development in constitutional practice to govern by public
statement of intention made by the executive government instead of bylegislation. This is no more, however, than a reversion to the ancient practice ofgovernment by royal proclamation, although it is now subject to the limitationsimposed on that practice by the development of constitutional law in theseventeenth century. [p 886]
Professor HWR Wade denies that this was an exercise of a true prerogative:
So far as the Crown came into the picture at all, it was exercising its ordinarypowers as a natural person, which, of course, includes the power to transferproperty, make contracts and so on. Blackstone was quite right, in my opinion,in saying that such powers are not prerogative at all.
The truth seems to be that judges have fallen into the habit of describing as
‘prerogative’ any and every sort of government action which is not statutory. Itmay be, also, that the responsibility for this solecism can be loaded onto thatpopular scapegoat, Dicey. [1989, p 61]
In 1993, when the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 had still
not been brought into force – despite a statutory obligation being imposed onthe Home Secretary by section 171 – the government published a White Paperannouncing its intention to implement a different scheme. In June 1993, theHouse of Lords introduced – and passed – an amendment to the CriminalJustice and Public Order Bill which would have required the Home Secretaryto perform his statutory duty under the 1988 Act. The House of Commonsremoved the amendment.
61When the Home Secretary introduced changes to
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme – claiming to act under the royalprerogative – proceedings for judicial review of his decision were instigated.The outcome was the judicial verdict that the Home Secretary had acted ultra
vires.
62
THE GRANTING OF HONOURS
Whilst legally still in the hands of the Crown, the effective control over thegranting of the majority of honours lies with the executive. The Queen has thepersonal right to confer the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, theRoyal Victoria Order and the Order of Merit. Otherwise, the conferment of

See, further, Chapter 25.

honours is by the Queen, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister who is, in
turn, advised by a Political Honours Scrutiny Committee comprising threePrivy Councillors.
63
REGULATION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE64
The control of the Civil Service is vested in the Crown and civil servants, likeministers, are servants of the Crown. However, the appointments arepermanent, subject to ‘good behaviour’, although, in practice, a civil servantwill not be dismissed other than for misconduct.
65Civil servants have no
contractual relationship with the Crown.66Salaries and other benefits are
prescribed by statute, but for the most part, the Civil Service is governedunder the prerogative.
67
REGULATION OF THE ARMED FORCES
As with the Civil Service, members of the armed forces are regulated underthe royal prerogative, and statutory protection of employment in, for example,the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, does not apply tomembers of the armed forces.
68
The sovereign is Commander in Chief of the armed forces. The Bill of
Rights 1689 prohibits the maintenance of an army by the Crown in peacetimewithout the consent of parliament. The control, organisation and dispositionof the forces are within the prerogative and cannot be questioned in a court oflaw.

The Royal Prerogative
THE PREROGATIVE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Acts of State70
An act of the executive as a matter of policy performed in the course of its
relations with another state, including its relations with the subjects of thatstate, unless they are temporarily within the allegiance of the Crown.
71
Acts of State in relation to foreign states
The recognition of foreign states and government, diplomatic relations –
including the sending of diplomats and the reception of foreign diplomats –declarations of war and peace, and the annexation or cession of territory fallwithin this part of the definition. 
Recognition of foreign states
The recognition of foreign states is within the prerogative of the Crown.Several statutes regulate the privilege and immunities enjoyed by heads offoreign states
72and their diplomatic representatives.73
Diplomatic relations
In 1708, the Diplomatic Privileges Act was passed after a Russian Ambassadorhad been arrested for debt. The Russian Czar, Peter the Great, regarded thisaction as a criminal offence. The Court of Queen’s Bench was uncertain as tothe legal position.
74The Act of 1708 provided that no judicial proceedings
could be brought against diplomats or their servants and that it was anoffence to commence proceedings.
Under the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964, diplomatic staff enjoy full
immunity – both civil and criminal – whereas administrative and technicalstaff have immunity for actions taken in the course of their duties but areotherwise civilly – but not criminally – liable for other acts. Members ofservice staff are only immune for official acts. Whether a particular member ofdiplomatic staff falls within a certain category is determined by the ForeignSecretary by means of a certificate. The court will determine whether theaction performed is within – or without – the individual’s official duties.

74Mattueof’s Case (1709).

Where an individual enjoys immunity from the courts, the only redress
will be for the Foreign Secretary to request the diplomat’s government to
recall him as persona non grata . 
Declarations of war and peace
Where a declaration of war has been made, the status of nationals of theenemy state within the United Kingdom is altered. If the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs issues a certificate to the effect that a stateof war exists, this must be accepted by the courts.
75
Annexation and cession of territory
In 1955, the Crown exercised its prerogative power to take possession of theisland of Rockall, which subsequently was incorporated into the UnitedKingdom as part of Scotland.
76Once territory has been annexed, the Crown
has a discretion as to the extent to which it will take over the liabilities of theformer government of the state.
77
The Crown also has the power to alter the limits of British territorial
waters.78However, while this prerogative seems firmly established, there are
doubts as to the power of the Crown – without parliamentary approval – tocede territory and thereby deprive British citizens of their nationality andother rights under United Kingdom law.
79When the Crown sought to cede
Heligoland to Germany in 1890, parliamentary approval was sought. Whilethe law may be doubtful, there is at least a convention that parliament’sapproval will be sought and granted.
Issue of passports
Consistent with the Crown’s power to regulate its boundaries and those whoenter and leave is the power to issue passports: again, under Blackstone’sdefinition, this is a questionable prerogative power, for the government isdoing no more than what it is free to do under statute and the power has nolegal effect as such. Nevertheless, the conventional classification of the right toissue and withhold passports is that of the prerogative. At common law,citizens have the right to enter and leave the realm. It is neverthelessextremely difficult in practice to travel without a passport, which is issuedunder the prerogative. In R v Foreign Secretary ex parte Everett (1989), the court
for the first time held that the granting and withholding of passports wassubject to review by the courts. The position in the United Kingdom – bothChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

uncertain and unsatisfactory – may be contrasted with that in the United
States of America where the Supreme Court has held that freedom of travel isa basic constitutional liberty.
80
The ancient right to issue the writ ne exeat regno – forbidding a person from
leaving the realm – is declared by Hood Phillips and Jackson (1987, p 132),relying on Felton v Callis (1969), to be ‘obsolescent’. The doctrine of
obsolescence has never been one accepted in English law. The rationale forsuch acceptance in relation to the writ ne exeat regno , and that of impressment
into naval service, is that offered by Lord Simon of Glaisdale in McKendrick v
Sinclair (1972) to the effect that:
... a rule of English common law, once clearly established, does not become
extinct merely by disuse ... but may ‘go into a cataleptic trance’ ... and revive inpropitious circumstances ... but not revive if it is ‘grossly anomalous andanachronistic’. 
That it is not obsolete is confirmed by two recent cases. In Al Nahkel for
Contracting Ltd v Lowe (1986), the writ was used to prevent a defendant
leaving the country to avoid a judgment of the court. In Parsons v Burk (1971) ,
an unsuccessful attempt was made to prevent the New Zealand rugby team
from leaving the country to play in South Africa.
In an unusual case, R v Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and Another ex parte Bancourt (2000), the lawfulness of the exercise of the
prerogative under an Order in Council,81authorising the removal of the
inhabitants of a British dependent territory – the Chagos Islands in the IndianOcean – in order to establish a military base on the islands, was tested. Thelast inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago were removed in 1973. None of theindigenous people owned land. The High Court nevertheless ruled that theyhad a fundamental constitutional right to ‘reside in or return to that part of theQueen’s dominions of which he was a citizen: where he was a “belonger”’.The power of the Crown was to provide for the ‘peace, order and goodgovernment’ of any territory. That power did not include the right to forciblyremove people from their homeland. They had been excluded from their land,albeit for good reasons of high policy, but they were not reasons which could‘reasonably be said to touch the peace, order and good government of theterritory in the Wednesbury sense, or even by a less intrusive reasonableness
test’. Laws LJ ‘doubted whether the Royal Prerogative power enabled theQueen in Council to exile her subjects from the territory where they belonged’,and said that ‘sending a Chagos belonger out of the Queen’s dominionsaltogether could only be done by statute’. The 1971 Ordinance was quashedand the government obliged to pay for the repatriation of those exiled and paycompensation.

Treaty making powers
The power to enter into treaties under international law is a feature of the
sovereignty of a state. In the United Kingdom, it is generally accepted thatsuch power is an emanation of the prerogative. As such, the entry into treatiesis regarded as a matter solely for the executive and not for parliament. Atreaty is defined as a written agreement between states governed byinternational law.
82It will be seen in Chapter 7 that under the doctrine of
parliamentary sovereignty, an Act of Parliament alone can alter domestic law.Accordingly, a treaty – being a creature of international law – cannot alternational law without being given effect by an Act of Parliament.
83It is for this
reason that, inter alia , the European Communities Act 1972 was enacted to
provide for the entry and application of European Community law into theUnited Kingdom. 
There is debate as to whether treaty making power is truly a prerogative
power. Blackstone’s definition insists that a prerogative power be unique tothe Crown: if it is exercisable by anyone else, it ceases to be a prerogative. Thesecond aspect is – according to HWR Wade – whether the prerogativeproduces ‘legal effects at common law’ (1985). It follows, therefore, that atreaty – having no legal effect in the absence of statute – is not a trueprerogative. However, the preferred judicial view is in line with Dicey: aprerogative act is any action of government not authorised by statute. 
The treaty making power of the executive was challenged in R v Secretary
of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte Rees-Mogg (1994). In
February 1991, the Heads of Government of the Member States of theEuropean Community signed the Treaty on European Union – the MaastrichtTreaty (see Chapter 8). The Treaty was to come into effect on ratification bythe Member States. In some countries, ratification was dependent upon theapproval of the majority of the people voting in a referendum, as for examplein France and Denmark. Under the constitution of the United States ofAmerica, treaties are ratified by the President with the advice and consent oftwo-thirds of the Senators present and voting. 
In the United Kingdom, no such constitutional arrangements exist. Under
constitutional practice, a treaty need only be approved by parliament if itrequires a change in legislation or the grant of public money. Otherwise, thepower of parliament is confined to the political process, and in the last resort,the forcing of a government’s resignation through the withdrawal of theconfidence of the House of Commons. However, a convention has beenestablished whereby parliament approves certain treaties. Under theChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Department of Trade and Industry (1990).

The Royal Prerogative
Ponsonby Rule,84the government undertakes to lay every treaty, when
signed, for a 21 day period before ratification, and secondly to inform the
House of all other ‘international agreements and commitments which maybind the nation to specific action in certain circumstances’.
Erskine May records the convention as follows:
When a treaty requires ratification, the government does not usually proceed
with ratification until a period of 21 days has elapsed from the date on whichthe text of such a treaty was laid before Parliament by Her Majesty’scommand. This practice is subject to modification, if necessary, when urgent orother important considerations arise. [1989, p 215 (see, now, 1997)]
The Ponsonby undertaking also included the commitment on the part of
government to make time for debate on a treaty if there is a formal demandfrom the Opposition or other party. The issue raised in Rees-Mogg was
whether the government had the power to ratify the Maastricht Treatywithout the approval of the House of Commons. It was clear that there wassubstantial opposition to the Treaty on all sides of the House, and thegovernment was not confident that any vote would approve the Treaty. As aresult, or as a failsafe device, the Prime Minister announced that, if necessary,the Treaty would be ratified under the prerogative: thus avoiding the risk ofparliamentary disapproval. The Queen’s Bench Division refused to grant anapplication for judicial review: the matter was within the prerogative of theCrown. In the long run, the Bill bringing the Treaty into effect in the law of theUnited Kingdom was passed by the Commons and Lords. 
JUDICIAL CONTROL OF THE PREROGATIVE
... the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows
him.85
Statute and the prerogative86
Although there is a degree of certainty as to the existence and scope of the
prerogatives discussed above, the discussion of all prerogatives must beregarded as overlain with a degree of doubt. Consistent with the doctrine ofparliamentary sovereignty, parliament has the right and power to abolish,restrict or preserve prerogative powers. For example, historically, the Crownowed the duty of protection to those under a duty of allegiance to the Crownwho were either under the age of majority
87or suffering mental incapacity.

85Case of Proclamations (1611).
86 Note that the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that prerogative orders (Orders in
Council) are not subject to challenge by the judiciary. This appears to confuse the
distinctive status of Acts of Parliament with the prerogative. See, further, Chapter 19. 
87 Now age 18 (Family Law Reform Act 1969, s 1).

Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
168This duty of protection – the concept of parens patriae – manifested itself in the
wardship jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Chancery.88The Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1949 gave statutory force to the jurisdiction,
which was further amended under the Supreme Court Act 1981. The ChildrenAct 1989, while not affecting the entire wardship jurisdiction, removes theright of local authorities to apply to ward a child (section 100). However, theAct also makes provision for local authorities to apply to the court (section100(4)) for an order under the inherent jurisdiction. The effect of this provisionis still unclear, but the constitutional implication is that, whilst the prerogativeof parens patriae in wardship has been placed on a statutory footing under the
1949 and 1981 Acts, the Children Act 1989 nevertheless recognises andpreserves a form of prerogative inherent jurisdiction.
Where an Act of Parliament seeks to regulate a matter previously falling
under the prerogative but does not expressly abolish the prerogative, thestatute will prevail. In Attorney General v de Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd (1920) ,the
court was faced with a claim for compensation by the owners of the hotel,under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, for compensation due as a result ofoccupation by the armed forces in wartime. The government sought to rely onthe prerogative under which a lesser discretionary sum of compensationwould be payable. The House of Lords rejected the government’s right to relyon the prerogative, holding that, once a statute had been enacted, theprerogative power fell into ‘abeyance’, that is to say, it was set aside for theduration of the life of the statute. Should the statute be repealed, theprerogative would once more come into operation.
In Laker Airways v Department of Trade (1977), statute and prerogative were
considered once again. The facts involved regulation of the transatlantic airroute. Under the Bermuda Agreement of 1946, the United States and UnitedKingdom governments agreed that air carriers should be approved by bothgovernments: the ‘designation’ requirement. In 1971, the Civil Aviation Actwas passed by parliament, providing for the licensing of airlines by the CivilAviation Authority (the CAA). The Act provided that the Secretary of Statecould give ‘guidance’ to the CAA as to the policy to be followed in theconsideration of licence applications. Mr Freddie Laker had both applied fordesignation under the Bermuda Treaty and had been granted a licence underthe Civil Aviation Act 1971. 
A change in government led to a change in policy, and it was decided that
British Airways should have a monopoly on the trans-Atlantic route.Accordingly, the Secretary of State issued ‘guidance’ to the CAA to the effectthat Mr Laker’s licence should be withdrawn. The Secretary of State alsorequested that the United States government did not proceed to grantdesignation to Laker Airways under the Treaty. In an application for judicial

The Royal Prerogative
review by Mr Laker, it was argued that the Secretary of State’s ‘guidance’ was
ultra vires . The court agreed, regarding the instruction given to the CAA as
beyond the normal meaning of the word ‘guidance’. The court also rejectedthe government’s argument that it had the right, under the prerogative, todeny Laker Airways’ right to fly the Atlantic route. The government couldnot, it was held, defeat a statutory right by use of a prerogative power.
In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister of State for Civil Service (1985),
the prerogative returned to the courts. The Prime Minister, as the Minister forthe Civil Service, by a prerogative order (an Order in Council) terminated theright of workers at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)to belong to trade unions. The order followed industrial unrest whichthreatened to disrupt the interception of signals intelligence. The Unionchallenged the order under judicial review proceedings, claiming that theyhad a legitimate expectation to be consulted prior to their rights tomembership being withdrawn. The Unions won at first instance, but lost bothbefore the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. 
The House of Lords accepted that the terms and conditions of
employment of civil servants were within the prerogative powers of theCrown.
89Their Lordships likewise accepted that the employees had a
legitimate expectation to be consulted before their rights were adverselyaffected. Nevertheless, the government’s plea of national security trumped theinterests of the union members.
90
The significance of the GCHQ case in relation to prerogative power is
twofold. On the question of the reviewability of the royal prerogative, theHouse of Lords declared that the exercise of the prerogatives of the Crownwere, in principle, as reviewable as powers exercised under statute. However,having boldly declared the principle, the court proceeded to qualify theapproach by stating that a number of matters would not be subjected toreview. Utilising the concept of ‘justiciability’, the court held that matters suchas the appointment of ministers, dissolution of parliament, grant of honours,treaties, and par excellence matters of national security were not appropriate
subjects for review by the courts. Each of these matters was regarded asinvolving matters of high policy which it should be for ministers to decide,and by implication for parliament to control.
91It remains the case after GCHQ
that many significant attributes of the prerogative remain immune fromjudicial review.
The case of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte
Northumbria Police Authority (1988) reveals a far less robust judicial attitude
towards the control of the prerogative than did the Laker Airways case. Once

(1986),discussed by Walker,  1987.

again, the issue involved was the relationship between statute and the
prerogative. The Police Act 1964 sets out the respective powers of the HomeSecretary, the police authorities and the Chief Constables of police with regardto, inter alia, the supply of equipment to police forces (sections 4 and 5). 
The Secretary of State, by way of a Circular, advised that the Secretary of
State would be making available supplies of riot control equipment to policeforces, irrespective of approval by the police authorities. The NorthumbriaPolice Authority sought judicial review of the legality of the Circular. TheHome Secretary argued first that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, hehad power to issue the equipment, and that, independent of the statutorypower which he claimed, he had the power under the prerogative to issue theweapons. On the point of statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeal heldthat no monopoly was reserved to the Police Authority and that, accordingly,the Secretary of State had not acted ultra vires. 
On the prerogative aspect, the court’s reasoning was both surprising and
interesting. First, the Court of Appeal accepted that the Police Act 1964 leftunaffected the prerogative powers to keep the peace. Little evidence wasadduced as to the existence of such a prerogative, but nevertheless, Croom-Johnson LJ felt able to hold that he had ‘no doubt’ that the Crown had such aprerogative. Nourse LJ stated that there was no historical or other basis fordenying that a prerogative to keep the peace could be viewed as a ‘sister’prerogative to the power to declare war, without making any reference toBlackstone’s division of prerogatives into ‘foreign’ and ‘domestic’ categories.Recalling that it had never been possible to identify all the prerogatives of theCrown and that their existence could be ascertained only by means ofpiecemeal decisions, Nourse LJ declared that there had never been ‘acomparable occasion for investigating a prerogative of keeping the peacewithin the realm’: 
The Crown’s prerogative of making war and peace, the war prerogative, has
never been doubted ... it is natural to suppose that it was founded, at least inpart, on the wider prerogative of protection ...
The wider prerogative must have extended as much to unlawful acts within
the realm as to the menaces of a foreign power. There is no historical or otherreason for denying to the war prerogative a sister prerogative of keeping thepeace within the realm ...
More surprisingly, the judge argued that the fact that no evidence existed was
almost conclusive proof that it did exist. In the seminal case of Entick v
Carrington (1765), Lord Camden had asserted that, if there existed authority
for the lawful exercise of power, it would be found ‘in the books’. It might bethought that in passing the Police Act, parliament considered that it wasproviding comprehensive regulation of the terms and conditions under whicheach regulatory body could act. It cannot have been contemplated that, byplea of a previously unconsidered prerogative, the provisions of the Act couldbe circumvented. Nevertheless, Purchas LJ was clear that:Chapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
170

The Royal Prerogative
... the prerogative powers to take all reasonable steps to preserve the Queen’s
peace remain unaffected by the Act and these include the supply of equipmentto police forces which is reasonably required for the more efficient discharge oftheir duties. 
The Northumbria Police Authority case is indicative of the fine line to be drawn
between updating a prerogative and creating a new prerogative. Prerogatives,
being a feature of monarchical power are, as Dicey stated, residual.Accordingly, for the judges to give recognition to an alleged prerogative, itmust be shown that the prerogative claimed existed before 1688. In BBC v
Johns (1965), Lord Diplock gave judicial expression to this in the statement: ‘...
it is 350 years and a civil war too late for the Queen’s courts to broaden theprerogative.’
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades’ Union
and Others (1995),the matter in issue was whether the Secretary of State,
having failed to implement the statutory scheme provided in the CriminalJustice Act 1988, was free to implement a different scheme under the royalprerogative.
92The scheme introduced a ‘tariff’ for compensation for injuries at
a substantially lower rate than provided for under the statute.
In the Court of Appeal, Sir Thomas Bingham stated that:
... the old non-statutory scheme was established by a proper exercise of
prerogative power. In the absence of statute, there would not, in law, havebeen anything to prevent the Home Secretary exercising his prerogativepowers to modify the old scheme or to revoke it and substitute a new onedevised on different principles.
Even after the 1988 Act had been passed, he would not have been open to legal
challenge had he continued the old scheme without bringing the new statutoryprovisions into force, so long as his reasons for postponement fell within thewide discretion accorded him.
But was he, while those provisions remained unrepealed, legally free to
exercise prerogative powers to establish a scheme radically different fromthose provisions?
Attorney General v de Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd (1920) and Laker Airways Ltd v
Department of Trade (1977) did not concern statutory provisions not brought
into force and so provided no direct answer to the question.
Again, the Home Secretary’s argument had given too little weight to the
overriding legislative role of parliament. It had approved detailed provisionsgoverning the form which, underpinned by statute, the scheme should take.The 1988 provisions were not a discussion paper but a blueprint approved inthe most solemn form for which our constitution provided ...
The Master of the Rolls accepted that the Home Secretary had the power to
invite parliament to repeal the provisions or to seek enactment of the tariffprovisions in statute or, alternatively, to seek to have the statutory provisions
17192 As announced in the White Paper, Compensating Victims of Violent Crime: Changes to the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme , Cmnd 2434, 1993, London: HMSO. The scheme

abolished and then implement the tariff provisions under the royal
prerogative. But:
... what he could not do, so long as the 1988 provisions stood unrepealed as an
enduring statement of parliament’s will, was to exercise prerogative powers tointroduce a scheme radically different from what parliament had approved ...
Accordingly, the Secretary of State could not avoid the requirements of the
1988 Act and introduce – by means of the prerogative – a different scheme. 
The House of Lords ruled, by a majority (Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord
Mustill dissenting), that the decisions of the Secretary of State not toimplement the statutory scheme, and to introduce an alternative schemeunder the prerogative, were unlawful. The House of Lords refused, however,to rule that the Secretary of State was under a legally enforceable duty to bringthe statutory scheme into effect at a particular date. 
However, the Secretary of State did not enjoy an unfettered discretion as to
whether to bring the scheme into effect, and he could not, through use of theprerogative, defeat the purpose of the statute. Lord Keith, dissenting, arguedthat the court should not become involved in a matter which was forparliament to determine. Lord Mustill was of the same mind, relyingspecifically on the Bill of Rights 1689:
Absent a written constitution, much sensitivity was required of the
parliamentarian, administrator and judge if the delicate balance of theunwritten rules evolved successfully in recent years was not to be disturbedand all the recent advances undone.
Some of the argument addressed would have the court push to the very
boundaries of the distinction between court and parliament established in, andrecognised ever since, the Bill of Rights 1689.
Three hundred years had passed since then and the political and social
landscape had changed beyond recognition, but the boundaries remained.
Here, within one case, are seen differing considerations weighing on the
judges in the House of Lords. The majority decision rests squarely on the ruleof law and the preference for statute over the prerogative. The minority view,however, leans far more clearly in favour of the doctrine of separation ofpowers and the supremacy of parliament in regulating its own affairs and incalling ministers to account.

POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE PREROGATIVE
Political control over the exercise of the prerogative, while preserving theseparation of powers between the executive and judiciary, may in practiceChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
17293 Note that, following the decision of the House of Lords, the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Act 1995 repealed the Criminal Justice Act 1988, ss 108–17, and made
provision for a scheme of payments of a standard amount of compensation calculatedin accordance with a tariff prepared by the Secretary of State.

The Royal Prerogative
173prove to be inadequate. In theory, the prerogative, as is the case with any
other act of government, is capable of being subjected to the full range ofparliamentary procedure.
94Thus, Question Time, debates and select
committees may be utilised in order to scrutinise prerogative acts. However,under parliamentary practice, there exists a number of issues on whichministers conventionally decline to provide information, and many of thesematters are precisely those which fall within the scope of the prerogative. Thedissolution of parliament is a matter for Prime Ministerial determinationalone: not even a duty to consult Cabinet is imposed, and the matter willcertainly not be for parliamentary scrutiny. Likewise, the grant of honours is amatter not for parliamentary discussion. On matters of the disposition of thearmed forces, weaponry for the armed forces, government contracts, judicialappointments, and investigations by the Director of Public Prosecutions, thegovernment will decline to answer questions. Aside from such specificmatters, the government may plead such wide notions as national security,confidentiality or the public interest in order to avoid scrutiny.
CONCLUSION
Under all constitutions, written or unwritten, there will be a number ofpowers reserved to the executive, powers which are exercisable without thepassage of legislation. Such powers may include the entering into treaties,declarations of war and peace, recognition of foreign states and diplomats.Such powers are referred to as ‘inherent executive powers’, or ‘prerogativepower’. Section 2 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900confers on the Governor General ‘such powers and functions ... as HerMajesty may be pleased to assign to him’. In 1900, these powers entailed thepower to summon, prorogue or dissolve parliament, to appoint judges andother public officials. Section 61 of the Constitution confers the executivepower of the Commonwealth in the Queen and declares that this executivepower is vested in the Governor General. Other powers were expresslyassigned to the Governor General in 1954 and 1973, implying that, for suchpowers to exist, they must be express and cannot exist by implication or byanalogy with the prerogative powers of the Crown. 
The scope of the powers has been the subject of judicial disagreement in
the High Court of Australia, some judges adopting a narrow view of thepowers, others a broader interpretation. In Commonwealth v Colonial Combing
Spinning and Weaving Co Ltd (1922), Higgins J adopted the narrow approach:
... the Governor General is not a general agent of His Majesty, with power to
exercise all His Majesty’s prerogatives; he is a special agent with power tocarry out the Constitution and the laws, and such powers and functions as theKing may assign to him.
94 This is to be discussed in more detail in Chapters 15 and 16.

In Barton v Commonwealth (1974), Mason J took a broader view of the powers
conferred under section 61 :
... enables the Crown to undertake all executive action which is appropriate to
the position of the Commonwealth under the Constitution and to the spheresof responsibility vested in it by the Constitution. It includes the prerogativepowers of the Crown, that is, the powers accorded to the Crown by thecommon law.
These two brief examples illustrate the point that, even under a written
constitution, the scope of prerogative power is capable of differinginterpretations.
95
Under the United Kingdom constitution, it may be concluded, quite
reasonably, that parliamentary control over the exercise of prerogative poweris less than adequate. Set alongside or juxtapositioned with the excluded areasof judicial review under the concept of justiciability, it can be seen that thereexists a reservoir of power, much of which is undefined or at best ill defined,which is not amenable either to judicial or to parliamentary control. 
REFORM OF THE PREROGATIVE?
It is precisely for the reasons discussed above that, in 1988, the Rt Hon TonyBenn MP introduced a Private Members’ Bill to place prerogative powersunder statutory authority. That Bill did not proceed through the legislativeprocess but such a proposal requires careful consideration. 
The Crown Prerogatives (House of Commons Control) Bill 1988 provided
a list of prerogative powers which would require the assent of the House ofCommons before having legal effect. Most significant of these are the powersto declare war, to make peace, to recognise foreign governments, to sign orratify treaties, to grant pardons, to confer honours, and more generally toexercise all other executive powers not conferred by statute. Clause 2 of theBill conferred on the Speaker of the House the sole responsibility for advisingon the dissolution of parliament and the issue of an invitation to a person toattempt to form a government. In respect of both of these matters, the assentof the House of Commons was required and that assent binding on theCrown. The power of the Crown to assent to Bills and of the House of Lordsto approve legislation would have been removed under clause 4 of the Bill.
The extent to which such a proposal would clarify questions as to the
existence and control of the prerogative is necessarily a matter for speculation.Nowhere in the Bill was the role of the courts mentioned. Once the House ofCommons had given its assent to the proposed exercise of power, the courtswould be precluded from examining the parliamentary process leading up tothat assent.
96The power of judicial review, however, would remain, and itChapter 6: Constitutional and Administrative Law
17495 Marshall and Moodie, 1971, Chapter 3.
96Pickin v British Railways Board (1974).

The Royal Prerogative
would be within the courts’ jurisdiction to determine whether the power
exercised was a power authorised by the assent. It has been seen in relation tothe GCHQ case that the courts have now developed a category of non-
justiciable matters, and the majority of the powers identified in the Bill fallwithin this category. To that extent, placing the prerogatives under statutoryauthority would, arguably, make little difference. Remaining powers, coveredin the general power ‘to issue all other executive powers not conferred bystatute’, would continue to be reviewable according to their subject matter.
However, the prerogative has been seen to be an elusive constitutional
animal which is capable of appearing in novel form under unforeseencircumstances. Recalling the Northumbria Police Authority case, it was there
seen that the prerogative ‘to keep the peace’ was pleaded as an alternative tothe existence of power within the Police Act 1964: a reserve power claimed asinsurance against the court finding that the minister had acted ultra vires the
statute. That the Court of Appeal upheld the minister’s claim was by nomeans a foregone conclusion, and to do so in the virtual absence of authorityand precedent, and with little analysis, quite remarkable.
The Northumbria Police Authority case illustrates the fundamental difficulty
of prerogative power: that of identification and definition. In March 1993, thePrime Minister, in a written reply to a request for a list of the occasions ofwhich the prerogative had been exercised over an 18 month period, declinedto provide the list, on the basis of ‘the complexity of the relationship betweenstatutory and prerogative power’.
97The Prime Minister could have confined
his excuse to ‘the complexity of the prerogative’. 
It can be agreed that there is little to suggest that replacing such powers by
statute, even if they could be identified, would lead to fewer abuses of power.Further, it may be added that, even if the powers could be identified, giventheir wraith-like nature, it would be impossible, conclusively, to define theirscope and application. For this reason, the prerogative – a paradox in amodern democratic state – is likely to retain its uncertain form, thus leaving togovernment a residue of largely uncontrolled power.
The Prime Minister (Office, Role and Functions) Bill, introduced into the
Commons in 2001, if passed, inter alia provides that the Prime Minister may
advise the Crown on the use of the royal prerogative, other than that ofdissolving or proroguing parliament, and that the Prime Minister hasresponsibility for the use of prerogative powers with the consent of the Crown(clause 6(1) and (2)). The Bill also provides that any use of the powerconferred in clause 6 shall be reported to the House of Commons within sevendays, subject to such restrictions agreed by the Speaker of the House as arenecessary to protect national security, or in the interests of the administrationof justice or the prevention and detection of serious crime. The prerogatives

CHAPTER 7
INTRODUCTION
The sovereignty, or supremacy, of parliament is ‘the dominant characteristic
of our political institutions’.1Sovereignty as a doctrine has long caused
controversy amongst philosophers, lawyers and political scientists and is aconcept which assumes – as does the rule of law – differing interpretationsaccording to the perspective being adopted. By way of example, internationallawyers are concerned with the attributes which render a state independentand sovereign within the international community. Political scientists areconcerned with the source of political power within the state. Legal theoristsand constitutional lawyers, particularly in the United Kingdom where thematter remains contentious, are concerned to identify the ultimate legal powerwithin a state.
DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF ‘SOVEREIGNTY’
Political and legal sovereignty – from the standpoint of sovereignty within thestate as opposed to sovereignty as understood in international law – may beanalysed as meaning either the supreme legal authority within a state or thesupreme political authority within a state.
2
Sovereignty as supreme legal authority
It is this interpretation with which AV Dicey and later constitutional writersare concerned. As this meaning is the central focus of our concern inunderstanding legislative – or parliamentary – sovereignty, consideration willbe postponed until other interpretations of the concept have been considered. 
Sovereignty as supreme political authority
The essence of this idea is that lawful power and authority must be inconformity with moral dictates: some form of ‘higher law’ or ‘natural law’.Political theorists of the eighteenth century contributed much to anunderstanding of the idea of ultimate authority. Four broadly similarapproaches, each entailing the idea of a ‘social contract’, may be outlined here.
177PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY
1 Dicey (1898), 1959, p 39.
2 For a more elaborate categorisation, see Rees, ‘The theory of sovereignty restated’, in
Laslett, 1975, Chapter IV.

Thomas Hobbes3offered the most extreme version of the social contract
theory, arguing that man by nature is incapable of regulating his life in peace
and harmony with his fellow man. Hobbes’s view of man in a society lackinga restraining all-powerful sovereign was inherently pessimistic, an attitudeencapsulated in the often quoted phrase that life is ‘solitary, poor, nasty,brutish and short’. In order for there to be civil order, it was necessary for eachman to surrender to the state his own sovereignty in exchange for security.Such a surrender was revocable only if the state abused its trust. Therequirement of obedience to law is strict: and yet there are limits: 
If the Soveraign command a man (though justly condemned) to kill, wound, or
mayme himselfe; or not to resist those that assault him; or to abstain from theuse of food, ayre, medicine, or any other thing, without which he cannot live;yet hath that man the Liberty to disobey. 
Further, Hobbes states that: 
The Obligation of Subjects to the Soveraign, is understood to last as long, andno longer, than the power lasteth, by which he is able to protect them. For theright men have by Nature to protect themselves, when none else can protectthem, can by no Covenant be relinquished.
According to Jean-Jacques Rousseau,4the citizen enters into a ‘contract’ with
the state, surrendering to the state individual rights in exchange for the
protection of the state. The state, according to Rousseau, is thus embodied inthe ‘general will’ of the people and becomes both the agent and ruler of thepeople in the peoples’ name. Rousseau’s vision of man differs markedly fromthat of Thomas Hobbes – far from living in a state of ‘war’ with one another,men in the ‘natural state’ of primitive society would have nothing to fight overand would be united in a community of endeavour to secure the essentialprovisions of life. Man comes together – from necessity – within civil society,and, through participation in the decision making processes, produces ademocratic society. Rousseau distinguishes between supreme power –sovereignty – and the government. Sovereignty lies with the people, and isabsolute and inalienable. The government’s power is less absolute, establishedto implement the will of the people and accountable to the people. Thegovernment is dependent upon the sovereign people for the continuation ofits power, and the people retain the right to revoke the power devolved.
Thus, for Rousseau, sovereignty is a concept which entails moral approval
and acceptance by the people whose ‘collective will’ sovereignty represents.
5
Indeed, for Rousseau:
... the sovereign, being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it,
neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs; and consequently thesovereign power need give no guarantee to its subjects, because it is impossiblefor the body to wish to hurt all its members. We shall also see later on that itChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

5Ibid, Bk I, Chapter VII, and Bk II.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
cannot hurt any in particular. The sovereign, merely by virtue of what it is, is
always what it should be. [p 177]
Thomas Paine advances a social contract theory in which the rights of the
individual are given central importance.6Paine both influenced and was
influenced by the French and American Revolutions. In Rights of Man, Paine
argued that the citizen gives up his rights to the state, but on a conditionalbasis. The state is placed in the position of trustee of the rights of man, andshould that trust be broken, the citizen has the ultimate – or sovereign – rightto depose the government. Paine argues that man has natural rights, ‘thosewhich appertain to man in right of his existence’. These rights are bothindividualistic and civil. The former category includes:
... all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and also all those rights of
acting as an individual for his own comfort and happiness, which are notinjurious to the natural rights of others.
By way of distinction:
Civil rights are those which appertain to man in right of his being a member ofsociety. Every civil right has for its foundation, some natural right pre-existingin the individual. [p 90]
These natural and civil rights are held by government on trust for the people,
and should – under an ideal constitution – be protected from governmentalabuse by a Bill of Rights. Such an approach is also taken by John Locke whoregards the people, as a collectivity, holding the sovereign power which is insome sense delegated to the government on trust, and who may accordinglyexert their sovereign power to remove the government if it violates its sacredtrust.
In Two Treatises of Government (1791), John Locke advances powerful
arguments for the limits of governmental power and the ultimate politicalsovereignty of the people. In Book II,
7Locke argues that men come together in
civil society and tacitly consent to be ruled by government directed to ‘thepeace, safety, and public good of the people’. Hence, the power accorded togovernment is not absolute, but whilst in existence, the legislative power is the‘supreme power’. Nevertheless, Locke concludes that if the people:
... have set limits to the duration of their legislative, and made this supreme
power in any person or assembly only temporary, it is forfeited; upon theforfeiture of their rules, or at the determination of the time set, it reverts to thesociety, and the people have a right to act as supreme, and continue thelegislative in themselves or place it in a new form, or new hands, as they thinkgood. [p 242]
Sovereignty, then, is limited and conditional: government holds supreme power
on trust for the people. On this view, the authority of the constitution will bedependent upon its conformity with a higher law. As KC Wheare explains:
1796Rights of Man (1791, Pt 1), 1984.
7 ‘An essay concerning the true original extent and end of civil government.’

This view of government limited by the natural rights of man lies at the basis
of the American Constitution and finds a place ... in many modernconstitutions. It provides a moral basis upon which a government’s actions canbe judged and, what is more, upon which the validity of a constitution can betested. A constitution binds in so far as it is in accordance with natural law.Neither a government nor a citizen may disregard the authority of aconstitution except in so far as the action can be justified by the law of nature.This is indeed a ‘higher law’ than a constitution. [1966, p 65]
DISTINGUISHING LEGAL AND POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY
It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between legal and political
sovereignty. The distinction is nevertheless one insisted upon by authoritiessuch as Sir Edward Coke, Sir William Blackstone and, in particular, AV Dicey.As with so much of the United Kingdom’s constitutional law, contemporarythinking about sovereignty remains influenced by the legacy of Dicey. Dicey’sinterpretation of parliamentary sovereignty will be examined below(pp 192–215). At this introductory stage, however, it is necessary to note thatDicey drew a strict separation between legal sovereignty and politicalsovereignty (as did Coke and Blackstone). In Dicey’s view, the people holdpolitical sovereignty whilst legal sovereignty rests with the ‘Queen inParliament’. In large measure, this clear demarcation between the political andthe legal is explained by the unwritten nature of the United Kingdom’sconstitution. In the majority of states having a written constitution, theconstitution defines the limits of governmental power. In the UnitedKingdom, by way of contrast, the powers of government – whilst ultimatelydependent upon the electoral ‘mandate’ – remain unconstrained by anyfundamental written document and subject only to parliament’s approval. Alllaw making power thus derives, not from the power conferring and powerdelimiting constitutional document, endorsed by the people, but from thesovereignty of the legislature: parliament.
LEGAL THEORY AND SOVEREIGNTY
Legal theory contributes to an understanding of legal and politicalsovereignty within the constitution. In the overview of the theories of JohnAustin, Hans Kelsen and HLA Hart which follow, it will be seen that, in eachcase, the jurist is seeking an explanation of the source of ultimate authority, itsidentifying characteristics and the manner in which sovereignty is upheldwithin a legal order. By revealing the characteristics of valid law, it becomeseasier to understand the distinction between laws and other rules in society –such as moral rules – which have binding effect, but which do not have theforce – and enforceability – of legal rules. Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
180

Parliamentary Sovereignty
John Austin
Within every civil society – or polity – there will be found, as a social and
political fact, one supreme power. The nineteenth century jurist John Austin8
was one of the earliest ‘modern’ theorists to offer an in depth analysis ofsovereignty, and his work – while much criticised by later writers – still marksa useful starting point for analysis of the concept. Austin’s theory was anattempt to define law in the positivist tradition.
9Law is nothing more or less
than the commands of the identifiable, illimitable and indivisible sovereignbody. The sovereignty conferred exhibits itself in the habit of obedience of thepeople, which in turn is instilled by the fear of sanctions which attach to alllaws and thus underpin the legal system. Laws are nothing more nor less thanthe general commands of this sovereign, to which sanctions are attached:
... every positive law, or every law strictly so called, is a direct or circuitous
command of a monarch or sovereign number in the character of a politicalsuperior: that is to say, a direct or circuitous command of a monarch orsovereign number to a person or persons in a state of subjection to its author.And, being a command (and, therefore, flowing from a determinate source),every positive law is a law proper, or a law properly so called. [Austin (1832),1954, p 134]
While the model most closely accords with the criminal statute, it is difficult to
endorse in relation to much of the civil law and in relation to those laws whichregulate the law making and law enforcing institutions within the state.However, in every state, whether monarchical or parliamentary, unitary orfederal, there must be some body which demonstrates the characteristics of asovereign. For Austin, sovereignty as a legal concept within the UnitedKingdom lies with the Queen in Parliament: as a political concept, theultimate sovereignty vested in the people. 
Austin’s analysis of both sovereignty and law is somewhat crude. It is
difficult, for example, to adapt his idea of sovereignty to a federal state where,to cite but one example, the distribution of power may confer co-equallegislative powers on both the individual provincial legislatures and thefederal government and provide for judicial review of the constitutionality ofprimary legislation.
10Today, his theory is the more difficult to apply when
considered in light of the United Kingdom’s membership of the EuropeanUnion.

11 See, further, below, pp 215–220, and Chapters 8 and 9.

HLA Hart
A thorough critique of Austin’s analysis is offered by Professor HLA Hart.
Hart portrays the legal system as being one of rules rather than commands.For Hart, Austin’s jurisprudence is tainted by its overtly coercive nature, asexemplified in the command plus sanction portrayal of law. Austin hasmissed, according to Hart, an important dimension of law: the concept of arule. Rules, for Hart, are distinguishable from commands in several significantrespects. Legal rules may, as with the criminal law, lay down specificprohibitions, breach of which will be met with punishment. Nevertheless,there are laws which do not exhibit the characteristics of prohibition andsanction. Many rules of law confer the power on individuals and groups toact, but evince no element of coercion: rules of contract, of making wills, ofentering into marriage, fall within this category. These rules Hart labels‘power conferring rules’: rules which are permissive and the breach of whichwill result in a ‘nullity’, a concept which is difficult to conceptualise as anAustinian ‘sanction’. 
By distinguishing between rules which stipulate prohibitions and rules
which confer powers, Hart is able to construct a theory of law which isrepresented as a union of primary and secondary rules. Each legal rule withinthe system is identified according to accepted criteria: what Hart calls the ‘ruleof recognition’. At the apex of the hierarchy of laws – whether bylaws of alocal authority, judicial decisions, delegated legislation or statute – is the‘ultimate rule of recognition’. This ultimate rule, while involving somecomplexity and uncertainty, is mostly explained in the form that ‘what theQueen in Parliament enacts is law’.
Hart analyses the problems surrounding the nature of sovereignty. In The
Concept of Law (1961), Hart discusses the concepts of continuing sovereignty and
self-embracing sovereignty , an issue which, as will be seen further below, has
attracted continuing academic debate. Hart argues that the conventionallyunderstood Diceyan concept of sovereignty is an interpretation which hasbeen accepted as the criterion of legal validity, but that that interpretation is‘only one arrangement among others, equally conceivable’ (p 145)
.The
Diceyan view is that parliament enjoys continuing sovereignty – that is to say,that each parliament, irrespective of time, has equal legislative competence tothat of any other parliament. However, Hart argues, parliament’s sovereigntycould be interpreted to be a form of self-embracing sovereignty – a sovereignty
which would permit the exercise of power to delimit parliament’s legislativepowers in the future. This power, however, being the ultimate power, wouldbe exercisable only once. Hart draws the analogy with God in the followingmanner:
... on the one hand, a God who at every moment of his existence enjoys the
same powers and so is incapable of cutting down those powers, and, on theother, a God whose powers include the power to destroy for the future hisomnicompetence. [p 146]Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
182

Parliamentary Sovereignty
In the former case, God enjoys continuing sovereignty; in the latter, self-
embracing sovereignty. Furthermore, neither of these interpretations, Hartinstructs:
... can be ruled out as wrong or accepted with confidence as right; for we are in
the area of open texture of the system’s most fundamental rule. Here at anymoment a question may arise to which there is no answer – only answers.[p 147]
Hans Kelsen
Hans Kelsen analysed sovereignty both within a state and within the
international legal order.12Kelsen’s theory involves nothing less than an
attempt to formulate a scientific global analysis of law. For Kelsen positive,man made, law is best expressed as a ‘norm’:
By ‘norm’ we mean that something ought to be or ought to happen, especially
that a human being ought to behave in a specific way. [1967, pp 4–5]
Each norm will be a valid legal rule if it is validated by a higher norm. Thus, a
bylaw will be valid if it is properly enacted under an Act of Parliament. Alegal decision will be valid provided that the judge is acting within hisjurisdiction. An Act of Parliament will be valid if enacted in theconstitutionally accepted correct manner. Taken together, the individual legalnorms will form a system which itself is validated according to the ‘basicnorm’ or ‘grundnorm’. While for Kelsen, unlike Austin, it is not necessary thatevery legal rule have an attendant sanction, it is crucial that the legal order asa whole is a coercive order:
As a coercive order, the law is distinguished from other social orders. The
decisive criterion is the element of force – that means that the act prescribed bythe order as a consequence of socially detrimental facts ought to be executedeven against the will of the individual and, if he resist, by physical force.[pp 33–34]
At an international level, Kelsen recognises that the existence of a valid
national legal order is dependent upon the recognition of the state underinternational law. Where a revolution occurs within a state, it is internationallaw which will determine the validity of claims to exercise legitimate powerand hence law making power. Thus, by this means, it is possible to view lawglobally. 
THE VALIDITY OF LAW AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW
In addition to identifying the characteristics of valid law, each of the abovetheorists also seeks to explain the relationship between – and distinctionsbetween – the concepts of validity and effectiveness. The importance of the
18312 1881–1973. See The Pure Theory of Law, 1967 and The General Theory of Law and State , 1961.

distinction between validity and effectiveness of law lies in explaining the
ultimate source of authority or Sovereignty within a state. One question whichfrequently arises is whether, if a law is ineffective (perhaps because it ismorally disapproved of by a majority of citizens, or because it is regarded asfutile), that law loses its validity within the legal order. The commonly agreedposition adopted by Austin and Hart is that such a law – provided that itconforms with the constitutional criteria for law – remains valid despite beingineffective. However, it is also a point of agreement that if a legal system wereto cease to be effective overall – that is to say, if a state of anarchy existed –then the ultimate sovereign power would be under threat, and wouldprobably be forced to change. The people, in rejecting the ultimate powerwithin the state, would be taking back the power which they had entrusted tothe sovereign. Accordingly, it can be seen that the legal sovereign isdependent ultimately upon the political sovereign power in society – thepeople. 
The effectiveness of law, while it does not per se determine legal validity,
nevertheless interrelates with law’s validity. Under the constitutional theoryof the United Kingdom, an Act of Parliament does not become invalid underthe doctrine of desuetude (disuse). As a result, statutes of great antiquity –
although never or seldom used – retain the force of law, and may be reliedupon at any time.
13Equally, a statute – of whatever date – is valid if it meets
the criteria of validity, irrespective of whether or not it is effective in achievingits objectives. This is the point made by Sir Ivor Jennings in relation to thebanning of smoking on the streets of Paris. A more realistic example of therelationship between the effectiveness and validity of law stems from thesystem of local taxation in the 1980s. The government decided that the existingsystem of taxation based on the rateable value of properties – irrespective ofthe number of persons living in the property – was inequitable. Accordingly,the government introduced the Community Charge
14(or Poll Tax) which
levied a flat rate of tax on each person within a local government area. Thesystem was first introduced in Scotland and was met with condemnation andevasion. As a result of its ineffectiveness – based on the rejection of the law bythe people – the government was forced to change the law. The law did notbecome invalid as a result of its ineffectiveness: rather, the ineffectivenesscreated a political reason as to why the law should be repealed. 
If that one instance of an ineffective law is extrapolated to the legal system
as a whole, the manner in which effectiveness affects validity can be seenmore clearly. If a legal system comes under strain to a significant degree, apoint will be reached at which there is civil unrest, anarchy or revolution. Thelaw will cease to be effective. The law, however, under the theory ofChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
18413 Unless expressly repealed. See, eg, the Statute Repeals Act 1998, which repeals
ecclesiastical leases legislation dating from the early sixteenth century.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
sovereignty, remains valid. At some point on the scale between general
effectiveness and more or less total ineffectiveness – and the point cannot beprecisely determined – the underlying explanation for the validity of law willcease. Effectiveness, accordingly, can be seen to be the prime condition formeaningful statements about validity.
15
In a revolutionary situation – as explained by Kelsen – there is a point
where the basic norm – or sovereign power – changes. The ultimate validity oflaw depends on its effectiveness. When there is a revolution, the basic normmay change, brought about by a change in the power structure within asociety ultimately creating a new basic norm. 
Ultimate validity and effectiveness: an illustration
The relationship between the ultimate validity of a legal system andeffectiveness is well illustrated by the position in Rhodesia, as it then was, inthe 1960s. Until 1965, the governance of Rhodesia was under the sovereigntyof the United Kingdom, with Rhodesia enjoying self-governing powers to theextent allowed under the Constitution of Rhodesia. By convention, the UnitedKingdom Parliament would not legislate for the colony without the expressrequest or consent of the Rhodesian Parliament. In 1965, however, the PrimeMinister of Rhodesia, Mr Ian Smith, issued a unilateral declaration ofindependence from the United Kingdom and asserted the full right of self-government. The response of the United Kingdom’s government was toreassert its own powers, reaffirming its right to legislate for Rhodesia in theSouthern Rhodesia Act 1965 and thus overriding the convention. Between1965 and 1979, when a constitutional conference resulted in full independencebeing conferred on the renamed Zimbabwe,
16there was thus doubt as to
which parliament represented sovereignty within the state of Rhodesia. 
Jurisprudentially, Hans Kelsen had argued that one of the conditions for
change in the sovereignty of the state – or, in his phraseology, the ‘basic norm’of a state – lay in revolution, whether by act of force or change in theallegiance of the judiciary. The case of Madzimbamuto v Lardner Burke (1969)
provided the opportunity to test the revolutionary position in relation tosovereignty. 
Madzimbamuto had been detained on order of the government of
Rhodesia under a provision enacted by the Rhodesian government post-UDI(the unilateral declaration of independence). Challenging the legality of hisdetention, Madzimbamuto claimed that the Act was ultra vires the powers of
the Rhodesian government. On appeal to the Privy Council, the traditionaldoctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was affirmed. Lord Reid declared that:
18515 See Kelsen, 1967, p 214; Hart, 1961, Chapter VI.
16 Under the Zimbabwe Act 1979 and SI 1979/1600.

It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom
Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and otherreasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it ashighly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that itis beyond the power of Parliament to do these things. If Parliament chose to doany of them, the courts could not hold the Act of Parliament invalid. 
Accordingly, the sovereignty over Rhodesia remained – from the English
courts’ point of view – that of the United Kingdom Parliament. The Rhodesiangovernment had de facto power; de jure power remained in the United
Kingdom. An impasse was thus reached: to the government of Rhodesia – andultimately the Rhodesian courts – the alleged sovereignty of the UnitedKingdom was an irrelevance. To the United Kingdom, however – asillustrated by Madzimbamuto’s case before the Privy Council – the ‘basic norm’
of the constitution of Rhodesia remained the sovereign power ofWestminster.
17Nevertheless, from the point of view of the judges within
Rhodesia, there was a dilemma: how to react to legislation promulgated bythe de facto sovereign power. From 1965 to 1968, the Rhodesian courts refused
to acknowledge the lawfulness of the Smith government, following the viewof the Privy Council that, since the government was unlawful, so too were allof its acts. However, to continue to deny the force of law to any acts of theunlawful government was to produce uncertainty and doubt. The doctrine ofnecessity was employed by the judges to give legal effect to what wasconstitutionally invalid. Gradually, the continuing effectiveness of the Smithregime was to result in recognition of the validity of its Acts, thus furtherrevealing the complexities in maintaining a clear separation between thecriterion of legal validity and effectiveness.
18
In a revolutionary situation, a change in the basic norm, or grundnorm,
will take place when the judges accept the new source of sovereign power. AsJW Harris explains:
Being merely a hypothesis of juristic thinking, the grundnorm does not change
the moment the revolutionaries shoot the King. It cannot change until juristschange their thinking, that is, until lawyers begin to make post-revolutionaryassertions to the effect: ‘The law in the country now is ...’ where ‘now’ refers tosome revolutionary, established source of law.
19
Kelsen’s theory of revolutionary change in the grundnorm has not been
universally accepted, but it marks an effort to deal with the difficult issue ofchange and continuity in a legal order. By way of example, in The State v Dosso
(1958), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, applying Kelsenian theory, acceptedthe validity of a coup and that the successful coup conferred sovereign poweron the victors. However, in Asma Jilani v Government of Punjab (1972), the
Supreme Court rejected the notion that any person seizing power could claimChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Sovereignty
the authority of sovereign power. Rather, sovereign power could only be
conferred on the successful revolutionary party under the constitution of thestate expressing the will of the people through the medium of chosenrepresentatives.
20
THE ULTIMATE RULE IS EXTRA-LEGAL
When one comes to search for the ultimate higher authority which itselfvalidates the basic norm, a logical impasse is reached. Accordingly, it isnecessary to look outside this discrete structural system in order to find theauthority which confers ultimate validity. On a domestic basis,
21we find this
validating force in ‘juristic consciousness’ – in other words, the acceptance oflegal validity by the judges. Kelsen’s view on the source of ultimate sovereignpower is analysed by HLA Hart in The Concept of Law . While keen to
distinguish his own theory of law from that of Kelsen and that of John Austin,there are similarities between Kelsen’s and Hart’s view of the ultimate validitywithin a legal system. For Hart, the ultimate rule of recognition is validated bythe sociologically observable fact of official acceptance. By this, Hart meansthat the officials’ – and most importantly the judges’ – acceptance of authoritycan be seen in operation whenever one observes a court of law. A judge mayperhaps personally disapprove of a precedent case or of a statutory provision,but his acceptance of its validity is demonstrated by his application of the law.Expressed differently, it is the judges who uphold and reinforce thesovereignty of parliament – the basic norm of the constitution. 
In Kelsen’s analysis, the ‘basic norm’ within any state will be the
historically traceable first constitution. In many instances, this will prove aworkable test. In the United States of America, the Constitution of 1787 will bethe basic norm; in the Republic of Ireland, the Constitution of 1937, and inAustralia, the Commonwealth Constitution of 1900, as amended. The positionin the United Kingdom is less clear cut on this analysis, which will assumeimportance when considering the status of the Acts of Union with Scotlandand Ireland.
22Since the Norman Conquest in 1066, there has been an
unrivalled continuity in constitutional development in the United Kingdom,interrupted by only two major historical events and a fundamentallyimportant, more contemporary, change. The first of these, the Civil War of1642–46, resulted in the execution of Charles I in 1649, and the abolition of themonarchy and rule by Cromwell until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.The second significant constitutional change came with the uniting of thesovereign parliaments of Scotland and England under the Act of Union 1706,
18720 See Iyer, 1973.
21 And Kelsen seeks to establish a global ‘pure theory’ for law, but that need not be
considered here.
22 See, further, below, pp 200–05.

creating the state of Great Britain, and later the Union with Ireland, 1800, by
which Act the state of the United Kingdom came into being. The third change,which has wide ranging implications for the constitution and law wasBritain’s accession to the European Community which took effect from 1973.Most recently, devolution to regional assemblies and ‘incorporation’ of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights under the Human Rights Act 1998have significant implications for the scope of legislative power whichparliament retains while these measures remain in force. These issues arediscussed below at pp 220–24.
SOVEREIGNTY AND WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS
Where a written constitution exists, it will have come into being either by agrant of independence from a previously sovereign power or through arevolution – peaceful or otherwise. Where the constitution arises from thenative authority of the people, it is ‘autochthonous’: 
... [the people] assert not the principle of autonomy only; they assert also a
principle of something stronger, of self-sufficiency, of constitutional autarky ...of being constitutionally rooted in their own soil. [Wheare, 1960, Chapter 4]
Where autochthony23exists, the authority for the constitution arises from the
people. The phrase ‘We the People’ has powerful psychological – and legal –
force, and the resultant document, the constitution, will be supreme. As KCWheare explains in relation to the United States of America:
The constitution of the United States expresses the essential supremacy of a
constitution in a federal government in the passage: ‘This Constitution and theLaws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ... shall bethe supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be boundthereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrarynotwithstanding.’ [1963, p 54]
All power entrusted to government comes from the people: it is accordingly
understandable that, under such a constitutional arrangement, there is astrongly held belief that government holds its power on ‘trust’ for the people.It may be said, as a result, that both law making and executive powers areconditionally conferred on those who hold public office, subject to thedoctrine of trust which will be enforced by the courts in the name of thepeople. All constitutions – written and unwritten – exist against the backclothof historical, political and moral evolution: none exists in a vacuum. However,under a written constitution, this background has a particular significance.The constitution, being the expression of the political morality of its age –updated by the judiciary through interpretative methods – is a constantreflection and reminder of the will of the people and the restraints which thatwill imposes on government. Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
18823 See Marshall, 1971, Chapter III.4.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
Chief Justice Marshall, in Marbury v Madison (1803) ,explained the power
of the constitution:
It is a proposition too plain to be contested that the constitution controls any
legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitutionby an ordinary act. Between these two alternatives, there is no middle ground.The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable byordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like otheracts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. If the former part ofthe alternative is true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is notlaw; if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, onthe part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable. 
It is possible, accordingly, under such a constitutional arrangement, for the
constitutional court24effectively to redefine the relationship between the
governors and the governed, the state and its citizens. By this means, theconstitution is renewed and reinvigorated. By way of example, the AmericanBill of Rights, enacted as amendments to the 1787 Constitution, provides that: 
All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state whereinthey reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any statedeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ...
25
This ‘equal protection’ clause has been the focus of the development of equal
civil and political rights in the United States of America. In 1896, the SupremeCourt was called upon to determine whether the policy of segregation of blackand white citizens was lawful under the Constitution. The court ruled that‘separate but equal treatment’ laws did not amount to a denial of the equalprotection of law.
26When, however, in 1954, the question of ‘equal protection’
came before the Supreme Court concerning segregation in the schools of thestates of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware, the court was to rulethat such ‘treatment’ violated the Fourteenth Amendment of theconstitution.
27
THE SOURCE OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
The sovereignty of parliament is not itself laid down in statute: nor could it be,for the ultimate law maker cannot confer upon itself the ultimate power. As

the High Court.

27Brown v Board of Education of Topeka (1954). The ruling did not end segregation on other
grounds. See King, 1964; see, further, the Civil Rights Acts 1964 and 1968.

legal theorists28have demonstrated, when searching for ultimate legal power,
there comes a point of inquiry beyond which one cannot logically move. In
order to understand the ultimate authority of law, whether expressed in termsof the ‘basic norm’ (Hans Kelsen) or the ‘ultimate rule of recognition’ (HLAHart) or sovereignty, the inquirer must move beyond the law itself. As hasbeen seen above, for both Kelsen and Hart, the key to ultimate power lies inits acceptance – but not necessarily moral approval – by the judges within thelegal system. Each theorist expresses a similar idea in different terms. Toreiterate: for Kelsen, the acceptance of sovereign power can be seen in ‘juristicconsciousness’. Hart is rather less mysterious, although still abstruse, statingthat the existence of sovereign power can be demonstrated in the everydayworkings of the machinery of the law. The test for acceptance, according toProfessor Hart, lies in the attitude of the officials in the legal system and mostimportantly the judges, what Hart terms the ‘internal aspect’ of law. Thisinternal aspect entails acceptance by the judges that the existence andacceptance of the authority of a legal rule is justification for acting in aparticular manner: that is to say, for reaching a judgment in a particular case.
SOVEREIGNTY AS A RULE OF COMMON LAW
Sovereignty is thus the fundamental rule of the common law, for it is thejudges who uphold parliament’s sovereignty. For as long as the judges acceptthe sovereignty of parliament, sovereignty will remain the ultimate rule of theconstitution. As Salmond explains:
All rules of law have historical sources. As a matter of fact and history they
have their origin somewhere, though we may not know what it is. But not allof them have legal sources. Were this so, it would be necessary for the law toproceed ad infinitum in tracing the descent of its principles. It is requisite that
the law should postulate one or more first causes, whose operation is ultimateand whose authority is underived ... The rule that a man may not ride a bicycleon the footpath may have its source in the bylaws of a municipal council; therule that these bylaws have the force of law has its source in an Act ofParliament. But whence comes the rule that Acts of Parliament have the forceof law? This is legally ultimate; its source is historical only, not legal ... It is thelaw because it is the law, and for no other reason that it is possible for the lawto take notice of. No statute can confer this power upon Parliament, for thiswould be to assume and act on the very power that is to be conferred.
29
Accordingly, the rule which confers validity on legislation is ‘logically
superior to the sovereign’. The logical consequence of this is stated by HWRWade:Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
19028 See Kelsen, 1961, p 116; Hart, 1961, p 104. See, also, Kelsen, ‘The function of a
constitution’, in Tur and Twining, 1986.
29 Williams (ed), Jurisprudence , 10th edn, p 155, cited by Wade, 1955, p 187.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
... if no statute can establish the rule that the courts obey Acts of Parliament,
similarly no statute can alter or abolish that rule. The rule is above and beyondthe reach of statute ... because it is itself the source of the authority of statute.
30
The sovereignty of parliament will only be lost under two conditions. The first
condition would be where parliament decided – perhaps on the authority ofthe people tested in a referendum – to abolish its sovereignty and to place itsresidual authority under that of a written constitution to be adjudicated uponby the judiciary. The second condition would be where the judiciary itselfunderwent a ‘revolution’ in attitude, and accepted that parliament was nolonger the sovereign law making body and that the judges owed allegiance toan alternative – or different – sovereign power. These points will be returnedto when considering challenges to the traditional Diceyan view of sovereignty. 
In the United Kingdom, in the absence of a written constitution which
asserts the sovereignty of the people and the sovereignty of the constitution –as interpreted by the judiciary – over the legislature and executive, the‘vacuum’ is filled by the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, or supremacy.Under this doctrine, political sovereignty vests in the people: legal sovereigntyvests with parliament over which no legal controls are exerted, but whichremains responsible to the electorate for the continued, and regularlyrenewed, grant of law making and executive authority. The means by whichthe constitution is renewed is through the democratic process and the conceptof a responsive responsible government, rather than through the means of aSupreme Court reinterpreting the constitution according to judicialperceptions of the mores in society. This is not to suggest that under a writtenconstitution, there is no responsive, accountable and democratic governmentor that the evolution of the constitution lies solely within the domain of thejudges. Rather, the point to be emphasised is that, under a writtenconstitution, there is an additional element in effecting constitutional change.Depending upon the independence, integrity and motivation of the courts,acts of the executive and legislature can be subjected to the control of theconstitution. 
The origins of parliamentary sovereignty
In Chapter 6, the manner in which the near absolute powers of the Crown31
were reduced by the courts and parliament was discussed. With the reductionin the King’s prerogative powers, there came about the correlative rise in thesovereignty of parliament. From 1688, the supremacy of parliament over theCrown was established. From this time, the prerogative powers of the Crowncontinued in existence or were abolished or curtailed as parliament

31 To make laws by proclamation, to rule under the prerogative without parliament, and
to participate in the judicial process.

determined. No new prerogative powers may be claimed by the Crown, as
Diplock LJ stated in BBC v Johns (1965).
AV DICEY AND SOVEREIGNTY
The classical definition of sovereignty, offered from a constitutional law ratherthan a jurisprudential perspective, is that of AV Dicey (1898). Dicey had beencritical of John Austin’s account of sovereignty, arguing that Austin confusedpolitical and legal sovereignty. From a legal-theoretical point of view, itremains imperative to separate the political from the legal and to recognisethat, as matters stand, legal sovereignty remains with the United KingdomParliament, although there may be political restraints which effectively inhibitthe exercise of those powers. On sovereignty, Dicey stated that:
The principle of parliamentary sovereignty means neither more nor less than
this: namely, that Parliament thus defined has, under the English constitution,the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and, further, that no person orbody is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or setaside the legislation of Parliament.
A law may, for our present purpose, be defined as ‘any rule which will be
enforced by the courts’. The principle, then, of parliamentary sovereignty may,looked at from its positive side, be thus described: any Act of Parliament, orany part of an Act of Parliament, which makes a new law, or repeals ormodifies an existing law, will be obeyed by the court. The same principle,looked at from its negative side, may be thus stated: there is no person or bodyof persons who can, under the English constitution, make rules which overrideor derogate from an Act of Parliament, or which (to express the same thing inother words) will be enforced by the courts in contravention of an Act ofParliament. [(1898), 1959, p 39]
From this description can be deduced three basic rules:
(a) parliament is the supreme law making body and may enact laws on any
subject matter;
(b) no parliament may be bound by a predecessor or bind a successor;
(c) no person or body – including a court of law – may question the validity of
parliament’s enactments.
It is the correctness of this definition which must be tested and evaluated.
Having considered the concept of sovereignty in theoretical terms,examination of the manner in which this is translated into a practical legaldoctrine is required. Dicey’s description of sovereignty will provide theframework for discussion.
Parliament’s unlimited law making power
This aspect of sovereignty is the easiest both to explain and to understand: therule means that there is no limit on the subject matter on which parliamentChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
192

Parliamentary Sovereignty
may legislate. Thus parliament may legislate to alter its term of office. In 1716,
the life of a parliament was limited to three years under the Act of 1694.Fearing the effects of an election, the government introduced, and parliamentpassed, the Septennial Act, extending the life of parliament to seven years. Theconsequence of this Act was to confer authority on the Commons to legislatewithout the express consent of the electorate: thus usurping the rights of thepeople.
32The Septennial Act, under a written constitution such as that of the
United States, would be legally invalid. Nevertheless, as Dicey argued,‘Parliament made a legal though unprecedented use of its powers’ ((1898),1959, p 47). Parliament also extended its own life between 1910 and 1918, andthe parliament elected in 1935 was to endure until 1945.
33Parliament may
also legislate to alter the succession to the throne, as with the Act of Settlement1700 and His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Parliament may‘abolish’ itself and reconstitute itself as a different body, as occurred with theUnion with Scotland Act 1706. Parliament may also legislate to alter its ownpowers, as with the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, whereby the powers of theHouse of Lords in respect of legislation were curtailed. Parliament may grantindependence to dependent states, whether dominions or colonies, as with theNigeria Independence Act 1960 and the Zimbabwe Independence Act 1979.Furthermore, parliament may legislate to limit its own powers in relation todependent territories, as shown by the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 andthe Statute of Westminster 1931.
34
Parliament may also legislate with retrospective effect, as with the War
Damage Act 1965. The War Damage Act effectively overruled the decision ofthe House of Lords in Burmah Oil Company v Lord Advocate (1965). In 1942,
British troops had destroyed oil installations in Rangoon, with the intention ofpreventing them from falling into the hands of the Japanese. The Britishgovernment made an ex gratia payment of some £4 million to the company.
Burmah Oil sued the government for some £31 million compensation. TheHouse of Lords held that compensation was payable by the Crown for thedestruction of property caused by the exercise of the prerogative power inrelation to war. The government immediately introduced into parliament theWar Damage Bill to nullify the effect of the decision. 
Parliament may legislate with extra-territorial effect, that is to say,
parliament may enact laws affecting the rights and duties of citizens and non-citizens outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Forexample, certain offences committed in a foreign state will be triable in thiscountry. Thus, murder, manslaughter, treason, bigamy and tax offencescommitted abroad will not render the accused immune from prosecution inthis country.
35Parliament may expressly legislate for overseas territory, as in
19332 See Priestley, 1771, cited in Dicey (1898), 1959, p 47.
33 Dicey (1898), 1959, p 47.

the Continental Shelf Act 1964, under which exploration and exploitation
rights of the continental shelf vest in the Crown. However, it is a presumptionof statutory interpretation that statutes will not be given extra-territorial effectother than where it is expressly or impliedly provided for under the Act.
36
Such statutes will normally be passed in order to give effect to obligationsundertaken under an international treaty.
37The Hijacking Act 1971, for
example, gave legislative effect to the Convention for the Suppression onUnlawful Seizure of Aircraft. Section 1 of the Aviation Security Act 1982,which succeeded the Hijacking Act 1971, provides that the crime of hijackingis committed when a person on board an aircraft in flight unlawfully seizescontrol of the aircraft and exercises control over it by the use of force or bythreats. The jurisdiction of the United Kingdom courts, with limitedexceptions, extends to an act of hijacking, wherever it occurs, and irrespectiveof the nationality of the hijacker.
38
The most often quoted and best remembered examples of parliament’s
theoretically untrammelled legislative powers are those offered by Sir IvorJennings: parliament can legislate to ban smoking on the streets of Paris;parliament can legally make a man into a woman; and Sir Leslie Stephens(1882): parliament could legislate to have a blue eyed babies put to death. InThe Law and the Constitution (1959),Jennings writes:
Parliamentary supremacy means essentially two things. It means, first, that
Parliament can legally enact legislation dealing with any subject matterwhatever. There are no limitations except political expedience andconstitutional convention ... if Parliament enacted that all men should bewomen, they would be women so far as the law is concerned. In speaking ofthe power of Parliament, we are dealing with legal principles, not the facts.Though it is true that Parliament cannot in fact change the course of nature, itis equally true that it cannot in fact do all sorts of things. The supremacy ofParliament is a legal fiction, and legal fiction can assume anything.
Parliamentary supremacy means, secondly, that Parliament can legislate for all
persons and all places. If it enacts that smoking in the streets of Paris is anoffence, then it is an offence. Naturally, it is an offence by English law and notby French law, and therefore it would be regarded as an offence only by thosewho paid attention to English law. The Paris police would not at once beginarresting all smokers, nor would French criminal courts begin inflictingpunishments upon them. But if any Frenchman came into any place whereattention was paid to English law, proceedings might be taken against him. If,for instance, a Frenchman who had smoked in the streets of Paris spent a fewhours in Folkestone, he might be brought before a court of summaryjurisdiction for having committed an offence against English law.

37 Parliament may, however, legislate contrary to the requirements of international law.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
These extreme, hypothetical examples illustrate the distinction between what
is theoretically possible and what is practically possible, or to express itdifferently, the distinction between validity and effectiveness discussed above.
The distinction is important and helps to explain the apparent paradox ofunlimited legislative power. 
An Act of Parliament will be valid if it has passed through the requisite
parliamentary stages and received the royal assent. The manner in which thejudges deal with this ‘enrolled Bill’ rule is discussed further below. All thatneed be noted for now is that, provided an Act of Parliament is ‘on theparliamentary roll’, it will be held to be good law. That is not to say that everyrule making power exercised by parliament results in an ‘Act of Parliament’which alone can alter the law, and is thus ‘sovereign’. 
Acts of Parliament alone are supreme
Resolutions of parliament
Resolutions of either House of Parliament – for example, decisions of theHouse of Commons – do not have the force of law and cannot alter the law ofthe land and thereby affect individual rights and duties.
39For a resolution to
have the force of law, it must be placed on a statutory basis. 
Proclamations
Proclamations of the Crown, issued under the royal prerogative, do not havethe force of law. To understand the status of proclamations, it is necessary toturn to the reign of Henry VIII. Under the Statute of Proclamations 1539, theKing was given wide – though not unlimited – power to make law withoutparliament’s consent. The Act was repealed in 1547, although monarchscontinued to ‘legislate’ by proclamation. The Case of Proclamations (1611)
clarified the constitutional position. The most significant aspects of the caselay in the findings, first, that the King could not by proclamation create anoffence previously unknown to law, and secondly, that the King had onlysuch prerogative power as was granted under law. 
Treaties
Treaties entered into under the royal prerogative cannot alter the law of theland. The courts have made it clear that treaties can take legal effect onlyunder the authority of an Act of Parliament.
40This point will be returned to
when the constitutional relationship between the United Kingdom and theEuropean Community is examined in Chapters 8 and 9. It is sufficient to notehere that a treaty has no legal force under domestic law unless and until itsprovisions are incorporated into law by way of statute.
19539Stockdale v Hansard (1839); Bowles v Bank of England (1913).
40 See, inter alia , The Parlement Belge (1879); AG for Canada v AG for Ontario (1937); R v Home
Secretary ex parte McWhirter (1969); Blackburn v AG (1971).

Resolutions, proclamations and treaties are but three species of ‘law
making’ which are distinguishable from statute: and it is the statute alone
which will be valid, provided that the required parliamentary procedureshave been followed. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic limits on parliament’s power
As seen above, the criterion of effectiveness underlies the supremacy ofparliament and represents one important – albeit extra-legal – constraint onparliament’s power. As Dicey says, sovereignty ‘is limited on every side bythe possibility of popular resistance’ ((1898), 1959, p 79). Leslie Stephensmakes the same point and is quoted at length by Dicey:
Lawyers are apt to speak as though the legislature were omnipotent, as they
do not require to go beyond its decision. It is, of course, omnipotent in thesense that it can make whatever law it please, in as much as a law means anyrule which has been made by the legislature. But, from the scientific point ofview, the power of the legislature is of course strictly limited. It is limited, so tospeak, both from within and from without; from within, because thelegislature is the product of a certain social conditions, and determined bywhatever determines the society; and from without, because the power ofimposing laws is dependent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itselflimited. If a legislature decided that all blue eyed babies should be murdered,the preservation of blue eyed babies would be illegal; but legislators must gomad before they could pass such a law, and subjects be idiotic before theycould submit to it. [p 81]
These views are indicative of the constitutional role of government today. In a
representative democracy, the proper purpose of government is to serve thepeople. In former times, when government was conducted by the King inCouncil, this was not necessarily the case. But even then, there were limits onmonarchical and aristocratic power: ultimately, law cannot be enforcedagainst the will of the governed. Compliance – in the absence of a military orpolice state – depends for the most part on voluntary acquiescence, not on theapplication of power. One of Hart’s principal objections to Austin’s ‘commandbacked by sanction’ theory of law turns on this point. As Hart explains, thelaw is largely ‘self-enforcing’ and ‘self-enforced’. By this, he means that it restson acceptance, by and large, by the people. Nowadays, with a more or lessdemocratic House of Commons
,the internal and external constraints
discussed by Dicey and Stephens coalesce. As Dicey explains:
The aim and effect of such (representative) government is to produce a
coincidence, or at any rate diminish the divergence, between the external andthe internal limitations on the exercise of sovereign power.
Where a Parliament truly represents the people, the divergence between the
external and the internal limit to the exercise of sovereign power can hardlyarise, or if it arises, must soon disappear. [(1898), 1959, pp 82–83]Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
196

Parliamentary Sovereignty
No parliament may be bound by its predecessor or bind its
successor
The rationale for this aspect of Dicey’s definition of sovereignty lies in the
recognition that for a body to be sovereign it must be, in Austin’s word,illimitable. For a sovereign body to be subordinate to another body would bea logical contradiction:
The logical reason why Parliament has failed in its endeavours to enact
unchangeable enactments is that a sovereign power cannot, while retaining itssovereign character, restrict its own powers by any particular enactment ...‘Limited sovereignty’, in short, as in the case of a parliamentary as of everyother sovereign, is a contradiction in terms. [(1898), 1959, p 68]
It follows, therefore, that each parliament must enjoy the same unlimited
power as any parliament before it. No parliament can enact rules which limitfuture parliaments.
41It is this aspect of Dicey’s definition which gives rise to
the most argument and which requires the most careful analysis. 
The doctrine of implied repeal
The doctrine of implied repeal provides the mechanism by which the judgegives effect to the rule against parliament being bound by previousparliaments or being able to bind subsequent parliaments, and therebyguarantees contemporary sovereignty. Parliament may, of course, repeal anyprevious law by expressly declaring that law to be repealed. The position ofthe judiciary is then clear: they must give effect to the latest expression ofsovereign will and judges are not free to apply the earlier statute. Theposition, however, may not always be so clear cut. Parliament may pass,perhaps through inadvertence, a statute, which while not expressly repealingan earlier Act, is inconsistent with it. When the judges are thus faced with twoapparently conflicting statutes, the doctrine of implied repeal will come intoplay, the judges applying the latest statute in time and deeming the earlierprovisions to be impliedly repealed. 
Two cases which illustrate the principle in operation are Vauxhall Estates
Ltd v Liverpool Corporation (1932) and Ellen Street Estates Ltd v Minister of Health
(1934), each of which entailed similar facts. Section 7(1) of the Acquisition ofLand (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919 provided that:
The provisions of the Act or order by which the land is authorised to be
acquired ... shall ... have effect subject to this Act and so far as inconsistent withthis Act those provisions shall cease to have or shall not have effect ...
The Housing Act 1925 provided for a less generous scheme for compensation
on the compulsory acquisition of land than the 1919 Act. In both cases, the
19741 On the distinction between ‘continuing’ and ‘self-embracing’ sovereignty, see the
discussion in Hart, 1961.

plaintiffs argued that section 7(1) of the 1919 Act was binding on the courts
and should be applied in preference to the Housing Act 1925. If that claimwere to succeed, the constitutional position would be that the provisions ofthe 1919 Act were effectively ‘entrenched’ – that is to say, have a superior legalstatus to that of other Acts of Parliament and therefore binding – on a futureparliament. In the Vauxhall Estates case, the Divisional Court held that the 1925
Act impliedly repealed the conflicting provisions in the 1919 Act and, in theEllen Street Estates case, the Court of Appeal again ruled that the 1919 Act
must give way to the 1925 legislation. Maugham LJ stated that:
The legislature cannot, according to our constitution, bind itself as to the form
of subsequent legislation, and it is impossible for parliament to enact that in asubsequent statute dealing with the same subject matter there can be noimplied repeal. If, in a subsequent Act, parliament chooses to make it plain thatthe earlier statute is being to some extent repealed, effect must be given to thatintention just because it is the will of the legislature.
42
With the doctrines of express and implied repeal firmly in mind,
consideration must now be given to the special problems allegedly posed forlegislative supremacy by grants of independence, the Acts of Union withScotland and Ireland, ‘manner and form’ and ‘redefinition’ theories. Theimpact of membership of the European Community and Union also requirescareful consideration, as does the recent devolution of power to the ScottishParliament and the Northern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies, and the HumanRights Act 1998.
Grants of independence
The Statute of Westminster 1931 was enacted to give statutory force to theconstitutional convention that the United Kingdom Parliament would notlegislate for Dominions without their consent. Section 4 provides:
No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement
of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of thelaw of that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act that thatChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
19842 See, however, the earlier case of Nairn and Others v University of St Andrews and Others
(1909), in which the House of Lords ruled that the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889,
which empowered commissioners to make ordinances, inter alia , to enable universities
to confer degrees on women, did not impliedly repeal the Representation of the People(Scotland) Act 1868, s 27, which provided the right to vote for, inter alia , ‘every person
whose name is for the time being on the register, ... if of full age, and not subject to anylegal incapacity’. In Jex-Blake v Senatus of the University of Edinburgh (1873), following
Chorlton v Lings (1868), the court ruled that ‘women’ were not ‘persons’ within the
meaning to be applied to the right to vote. The House of Lords in Nairn ruled that only
parliament, in the most express terms, could ‘effect a constitutional change somomentous and far-reaching’, and it could not be taken to have done so by ‘so furtive aprocess’ as this later Act ((1909), per Lord Loreburn LC). Given the date of this case, and
its positioning in the continuing struggle for women’s right to vote, which was soconsistently obstructed by the courts, the decision is perhaps best understood withinthe political climate of the time rather than as an illustration of objective legal analysis.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.
Where parliament confers partial competence on a subordinate legislature, the
question arises as to whether the United Kingdom Parliament can revoke thatgrant of power. The principle that parliament cannot be bound by the Acts ofits predecessor has already been established. The issue here is the relationshipbetween the sovereign parliament and a parliament dependent for its powersupon Westminster. This issue arose in British Coal Corporation v The King
(1935). The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to determine whetheror not the Canadian legislature had the power to regulate or prohibit appealsin criminal matters to the King in Council. A determination of that matterentailed consideration of the scope of legislative competence of the legislature.The relevant Acts were the British North America Act 1867, the Colonial LawsValidity Act 1865, the Statute of Westminster 1931 and the Canadian CriminalCode which prohibited appeal to the courts of the United Kingdom. TheStatute of Westminster had removed any legislative incompetence from theCanadian legislature and accordingly the legislature had full power to enactthe section in question. It was accepted by the Judicial Committee of the PrivyCouncil that, whilst the power of the Imperial Parliament remained ‘in theoryunimpaired’ and that, ‘as a matter of abstract law’, section 4 of the Statute ofWestminster could be repealed by the parliament of the United Kingdom, inpractice it could not be: ‘... legal theory must march alongside practicalreality.’ British Coal Corporation v The King is, however, no more than a
recognition of the extrinsic or practical limitations on the exercise ofsovereignty, and not of any legal limitations on parliament’s supremacy. 
In Ndlwana v Hofmeyer (1937),
43the Appellate Division of the South
African High Court adopted the view that such a restriction amounted to afetter on parliament’s powers: ‘... freedom once conferred cannot berevoked.’
44Again, however, it is to be noted that such judicial utterances do
no more than recognise the practical political restraints which are imposed onparliament, not its legal powers. It is correct, therefore, to view such obiter as
reflecting the distinction between legal and political sovereignty: a pointemphasised by Dicey himself.
The question of the status and effect of section 4 of the Statute of
Westminster arose once more in Manuel and Others v Attorney General (1982).
The issue concerned was whether the Canada Act 1982 passed by the UnitedKingdom Parliament, at the request and consent of Canada, was a validenactment. The plaintiffs’ argument was that the United Kingdom Parliamenthad no power to amend the Constitution of Canada to the detriment of thenative population without their consent. It was argued that section 4 of theStatute of Westminster required not just the consent of the federal parliament
19943 See, also, Ibralebbe v R (1964) ; Blackburn v AG (1971).
44 At p 237. See, also, Owen Dixon, 1935, but cf his later view expressed in Hughes and Vale
Property Ltd v Gair (1954).

but also that of all the provincial legislatures and the native minority
population. The application failed: the Statute of Westminster, as interpretedby the Court of Appeal, did not require the actual consent of a Dominion, butrather the mere recital on the face of the request that the United Kingdomlegislate for the Dominion. Having thus failed on that point, the plaintiffsproceeded to argue that the conventional rule, which predated the Statute ofWestminster 1931, had hardened into a rule of law and was thus as effectiveas section 4 of the statute. The Court of Appeal rejected that reasoning,
45
maintaining the traditional distinction between conventions and rules of law.
The Acts of Union with Scotland 1706/1707 and Ireland 180046
The Acts of Union, their status and their effect on parliament’s sovereigntyhave provided a fertile source for academic debate which represents apowerful argument against the unlimited freedom of any parliament at anytime to legislate as it pleases. The whole debate centres on the notion that thenew United Kingdom Parliament was, in the words of Professor JDBMitchell,
47‘born unfree’. The idea being conveyed here is that the Acts of
Union have some form of ‘higher law’ status which binds and limits thepowers of parliament.
The union with Scotland
As discussed in Chapter 3, prior to the accession to the throne of James I(James VI of Scotland), England and Scotland were both independentsovereign states, each having its own monarch and parliament. With James’saccession to the English throne in 1603, the two countries were united underone monarch but retained their sovereign parliaments until 1706. The Treatyof Union 1706 effected, conceptually, the abolition of both parliaments and thebirth of the Parliament of Great Britain. 
Article I of the Act of Union provides: 
That the two kingdoms of England and Scotland shall upon the first day of
May which shall be in the year one thousand seven hundred and seven and forever after be united into one Kingdom by the name of Great Britain ...
The sovereignty issue has been argued in three cases concerning the Act of
Union with Scotland. In MacCormick v Lord Advocate (1953), MacCormick
sought an injunction against the Lord Advocate, as representative of theCrown, preventing the use of the title Queen Elizabeth II of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain. The objection to the use of the title was based onhistorical inaccuracy
48and a contravention of Article I of the Treaty of UnionChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Sovereignty
which provided for the union of the two countries from 1707. The petition was
dismissed as was the subsequent appeal. Lord Cooper, the Lord President,however, proceeded to discuss the doctrine of sovereignty:
The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of parliament is a distinctively
English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law. Itderives from Coke and Blackstone, and was widely popularised during the19th century by Bagehot and Dicey, the latter having stated the doctrine in itsclassic form in his The Law of the Constitution . Considering that the Union
legislation extinguished the Parliaments of Scotland and England and replacedthem by a new parliament, I have difficulty in seeing why it should have beensupposed that the new Parliament of Great Britain must inherit all the peculiarcharacteristics of the English Parliament but none of the Scottish Parliament, asif all that happened in 1707 was that Scottish representatives were admitted tothe Parliament of England. That is not what was done. Further, the Treaty andthe associated legislation, by which the Parliament of Great Britain wasbrought into being as the successor of the separate Parliaments of Scotland andEngland, contain some clauses which expressly reserve to the Parliament ofGreat Britain powers of subsequent modification, and other clauses whicheither contain no such power or emphatically exclude subsequent alteration bydeclarations that the provision shall be fundamental and unalterable in all timecoming, or declarations of a like effect. 
I have not found in the Union legislation any provision that the Parliament of
Great Britain should be ‘absolutely sovereign’ in the sense that that Parliamentshould be free to alter the Treaty at will.
In Gibson v The Lord Advocate (1975), the issue tested was whether allowing
fishermen of Member States of the European Community to fish in Scottish
coastal waters infringed Article XVIII of the Act of Union. Article XVIIIprovides that:
... no alteration be made in laws which concern private right except for the
evident utility of the subjects within Scotland.
The claim was dismissed, Lord Keith ruling that the European Community
Regulations did not confer rights or obligations on individual citizens andaccordingly were matters of public and not private law and, accordingly, thatArticle XVIII could not be invoked. On the sovereignty question, Lord Keithstated that:
There were addressed to me interesting arguments upon the question of
jurisdiction and the competency of the action. These arguments raisedconstitutional issues of great potential importance, in particular whether theCourt of Session has power to declare an Act of the United KingdomParliament to be void, whether an alleged discrepancy between an Act of thatParliament and the Treaty or Act of Union is a justiciable issue in this court,and whether, with particular reference to Article XVIII of the Act of Union, thiscourt has power to decide whether an alteration of private law bearing to beeffected by an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament is ‘for the evident utility’of the subjects in Scotland. Having regard to my decision on relevancy, theseare not live issues in the present case ...
201

Like Lord President Cooper, I prefer to reserve my opinion what the position
would be if the United Kingdom Parliament passed an Act purporting toabolish the Court of Session or the Church of Scotland or to substitute Englishlaw for the whole body of Scots law. I am, however, of the opinion that thequestion whether a particular Act of the United Kingdom Parliament altering aparticular aspect of Scots private law is or is not ‘for the evident utility’ of thesubjects within Scotland is not a justiciable issue in this court. The making ofdecisions upon what must essentially be a political matter is no part of thefunction of the court, and it is highly undesirable that it should be. Thefunction of the court is to adjudicate upon the rights and obligations of theindividual person, natural or corporate, in relation to other persons or, incertain instances, to the state. A general inquiry into the utility of certainlegislative measures as regards the population generally is quite outside itscompetence.
In Sillars v Smith (1982), a similar challenge was lodged over the validity of the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, on the basis that the United Kingdom
Parliament, which had passed the Scotland Act 1978, which created alegislative Assembly for Scotland, had no power to repeal that Act – as hadbeen done – and accordingly, parliament, it was argued, had no power to passthe Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act. The claim was dismissed, the courtadopting the classical view expressed in Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway
Company v Wauchope (1842) by Lord Campbell:
All that a court of justice can look to is the parliamentary roll; they see that an
Act has passed both Houses of Parliament, and that it has received the royalassent, and no court of justice can enquire into the manner in which it wasintroduced into parliament, what was done previously to its being introduced,or what passed in parliament during the various stages of its progress throughboth Houses of Parliament. I therefore trust that no such enquiry will hereafterbe entered into in Scotland, and that due effect will be given to every Act ofParliament, both private as well as public, upon the just construction whichappears to arise upon it.
Despite the questioning dicta of Lords Cooper and Keith on sovereignty, the
evidence to date goes clearly against the notion that the Act of Union is legally
unalterable. To take but one example, the Protestant Religion and PresbyterianChurch Act 1707 provision that ‘the true Protestant religion and the worship,discipline and government’ of the established church were ‘to continuewithout any alteration to the people of this land in all succeeding generations’was incorporated into the Treaty of Union and declared to be ‘a fundamentaland essential condition of the ... Union in all times coming’. The Act alsorequired that teachers in universities and schools had to subscribe to the faith.Yet, in 1711, the Scottish Episcopalians Act and the Church Patronage(Scotland) Act were passed to reflect greater religious toleration, and by theUniversities (Scotland) Act 1853 and the Parochial and Burgh Schoolmasters(Scotland) Act 1861, the requirement that teachers must subscribe to theProtestant faith was removed. Further changes in the organisation of theChurch were made in the Church of Scotland Act 1921. Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
202

Parliamentary Sovereignty
The union with Ireland
The Act of Union with Ireland 1800 has given rise to similar arguments,
although these arguments are even less convincing than those addressed tothe Act of Union with Scotland. The Act of Union was declared to ‘lastforever’. Article 5 provided for a United Church of England and Ireland that‘shall be and shall remain in full force for ever, and that this be deemed andtaken to be an essential and fundamental part of the Union’. Nevertheless, in1869 the Irish Church was disestablished under the Irish Church Act of thatyear. In Ex parte Canon Selwyn (1872), a clergyman sought an order of
mandamus against the Lord President of the Council ordering him to petitionthe Queen for adjudication of the question whether the giving of the royalassent to the Irish Church Act 1869 was contrary to the coronation oath andthe Act of Settlement. The coronation oath contained a commitment tomaintain a unified and established Church of England and Ireland. The courtdismissed the petition on the basis that the statute was supreme and could notbe questioned in a court of law.
The Acts of Union
49provided for the permanent union between Ireland
and Great Britain. However, the Ireland Act 1949 recognised republican statusand independence of southern Ireland, thereby terminating the union. The1949 Act also provided that Northern Ireland:
… remains part of His Majesty’s dominions and of the United Kingdom and it
is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereofcease to be part of His Majesty’s dominions and of the United Kingdomwithout consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. [s 1(2)]
Under the Northern Ireland Constitution (Amendment) Act 1973, the United
Kingdom Parliament reiterated the statutory guarantee that Northern Irelandwould not cease to be part of the United Kingdom unless and until a majorityof voters should determine otherwise. That commitment is reiterated insection 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. However, such assurances, whilstmorally and politically binding on the government, do not amount – underDiceyan theory – to a legal restriction on parliament’s powers. Parliamentremains free, in legal theoretical terms, to legislate contrary to suchundertakings, although the political implications of so doing guarantee thatparliament will not do so. 
AV Dicey and the Acts of Union
AV Dicey had argued that the Acts of Union had no greater legal status thanthe Dentists Act 1878, or indeed any other unimportant Act.
50Moreover, as
has been seen, Dicey viewed the Acts of Unions as being ordinary Acts ofParliament by which – in the case of the Union with Scotland – the English
20349 The Act of Union (Ireland) 1800; the Act of Union with Ireland Act 1800.
50 Dicey (1898), 1959, p 145.

and Scottish Parliaments ‘abolished’ themselves, to be reconstituted as the
Parliament of Great Britain, and in the case of the Act of Union with Ireland,were reconstituted as the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The key passagewhich reveals his view is the following: 
Let the reader, however, note that the impossibility of placing a limit on the
exercise of sovereignty does not in any way prohibit either logically, or inmatter of fact, the abdication of sovereignty ... A sovereign power can divestitself of authority in two ways, and (it is submitted) in two ways only. It maysimply put an end to its own existence. Parliament could extinguish itself bylegally dissolving itself and leaving no means whereby a subsequentParliament could be legally summoned ... The Parliament of England wentvery near doing this when, in 1539, the Crown was empowered to legislate byproclamation; and though the fact is often overlooked, the Parliaments both ofEngland and of Scotland did, at the time of the Union, each transfer sovereignpower to a new sovereign body, namely, the Parliament of Great Britain. ThisParliament, however, just because it acquired the full authority of the twolegislatures by which it was constituted, became in its turn a legally supremeor sovereign legislature, authorised therefore, though contrary perhaps to theintention of its creators, to modify or abrogate the Act of Union by which itwas constituted. If indeed the Act of Union had left alive the Parliaments ofEngland and Scotland, though for one purpose only, namely, to modify whennecessary the Act of Union, and had conferred upon the Parliament of GreatBritain authority to pass any law which did not infringe upon or repeal the Actof Union, then the Act of Union would have been a fundamental lawunchangeable legally by the British Parliament: but in this case, the Parliamentof Great Britain would have been, not a sovereign, but a subordinate,legislature, and the ultimate sovereign body, in the technical sense of that term,would have been the two Parliaments of England and of Scotland respectively.[p 69]
Alternative interpretations of the Acts of Union
The power of parliament to ‘abolish itself’ and to be reconstituted as a ‘new
parliament’ is one of the principal matters to which opponents to Diceyantheory address their arguments. Professor JDB Mitchell (1963), for example,questions Dicey’s insistence on the equal legal status of Acts of Parliament,distinguishing between rules which create and represent the foundation of thestate, and other derivative rules of law: ‘... the one set of rules creates or is thelegal foundation of the state, the other is built upon that foundation.’
The Acts of Union of Scotland and England creating the unified
Parliament of Great Britain represents a ‘fresh starting point’. In Mitchell’sview, the Acts of Union, being antecedent to the Parliament of Great Britain,imposed valid legal limitations on its powers. Conceding that many legislativechanges have been made to the provisions of the Acts of Union, Mitchellnevertheless argues that the provisions, at least in relation to the Church ofScotland and the Court of Session, are essential limitations on parliament’spowers.Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
204

Parliamentary Sovereignty
Professor Neil MacCormick also challenges Diceyan orthodoxy.51In
MacCormick’s view, the Acts of Union amounted to a rudimentary written
constitution. Adopting Kelsenian terminology, the Anglo-Scottish Treaty of1706 and the Union with Ireland 1800 represent the ‘historically firstconstitution’ of Great Britain and the United Kingdom respectively, andaccordingly have a very special status in constitutional law. Harry Calvert(1968) specifically rejects Dicey’s view of the effects of the Acts of Union as‘untenable’. Calvert adopts Professor RVF Heuston’s arguments (1964a,pp 20–30) regarding the legal status of the Acts of Union and proceeds toargue that the royal assent could be denied – in a departure fromconstitutional convention – to a Bill purporting to sever the union betweenNorthern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom against the wishes of thepeople, the expression of which has been provided for by statute. Such aseverance would, in Calvert’s view, be unconstitutional. Accordingly, itwould be for the Crown to defeat any attempt to act unconstitutionally:
[A]t all events, it cannot readily be conceded that a constitutional monarch has
no constitutional power to resist being implicated in unconstitutionality by hisministers. The bounds of the British constitution are very widely drawn. Thereis very little that a Prime Minister, supported by his Cabinet and a majority ofthe House of Commons, cannot do. But if there is nothing that he cannot do,there is no constitution at all. [1968, p 32]
Manner and form and redefinition theories
Parliament, in the exercise of its sovereign power, may specify particular
procedures which must be undertaken in order to enact legislation. It has beenseen, for example, that the Northern Ireland Constitution (Amendment) Act1973 provided that the six counties of Northern Ireland shall not cease to bepart of the United Kingdom unless the proposed separation is approved by amajority of the electorate in a border poll (referendum). This may beinterpreted to mean either that parliament has specified the procedure – ormanner and form – for enacting laws, or that parliament has ‘redefined’ itselffor the purposes of enacting laws, by including in the definition of parliamentthe electorate of Northern Ireland. Any provision relating solely to procedurebut not affecting the composition of parliament may be termed a ‘manner andform’ provision; whereas when the actual composition of parliament isaltered, the appropriate term is ‘redefinition’. The Northern Ireland(Amendment) Act straddles both theories.
The essential question to be asked is whether such provisions, however
labelled, are capable of binding a future parliament. If that were to be the case– and, as will be seen, there are supporters for that view – two possibleconclusions would follow: first, that parliament has unlimited power –exercisable, as HLA Hart argues (see above, pp 182–83), only at one single
20551 1978; see, also, 2001.

point in time, forever after to limit the sovereignty of future parliaments; and,
secondly, that future parliaments would be less than sovereign – acontradiction in terms, for it would not then be correct to speak of parliamenthaving unlimited sovereignty.
A seminal case illustrating manner and form theory is that of the Attorney
General for New South Wales v Trethowan (1932). In 1929, the government of
New South Wales, Australia, sought to prevent a subsequent governmentfrom abolishing the Legislative Council (the upper chamber). An Act ofParliament was passed, amending the Constitution Act 1902, providing thatany Bill purporting to abolish the upper House must have the approval ofboth legislative chambers and of two-thirds of the members of each chamber.Further, there had to be popular electoral support for the abolition, to bedetermined in a referendum. In addition, to prevent a subsequent parliamentignoring the provisions of the 1929 Act, it was provided that any Billattempting to repeal the 1929 Act must follow the same procedure: a deviceknown as ‘double entrenchment’. In 1930, following an election, the incominggovernment decided to abolish the upper chamber and to do so by ignoringthe provisions of the 1929 Act. Members of the Legislative Council sought aninjunction restraining the grant of the royal assent to the Bill, and a declarationthat such a grant of assent would be unlawful, being ultra vires the lower
House. The High Court of Australia ruled that the provisions of the 1929 Actcould not be avoided, and that the royal assent could not be given to the Bill.The matter was referred to the Privy Council which affirmed the judgment ofthe High Court of Australia.
The constitutional reason underlying the court’s rejection of the
government’s claim that the 1932 Bill could lawfully receive the royal assentwas that the parliament in New South Wales was a legislative body havingsubordinate and not supreme power. Such powers as the legislature enjoyedwere derived from the sovereign United Kingdom Parliament under theConstitution Acts 1902–29 and the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. TheColonial Laws Validity Act 1865 represented a landmark in the clarification ofpowers between the sovereign United Kingdom Parliament and subordinatecolonial legislatures. The Act gave statutory affirmation to the non-legalconventional rule that laws enacted in the colony which were contradictory tostatute or the common law of the United Kingdom would not be held to beinvalid by the courts of the United Kingdom. The Act further clarified theextent to which the colonial legislature had power to amend its owncomposition and procedure. Section 5 is the all-important provision forcurrent purposes. Section 5 provides that:
... every representative legislature shall ... have and be deemed at all times to
have had, full power to make laws respecting the constitution, power, andprocedure of such legislature; provided that such laws shall have been passedin such manner and form as may from time to time be required by any Act ofParliament, letters patent, Order in Council, or colonial law, for the time beingin force in the said colony.Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Sovereignty
It is this section which dictated the decision in Attorney General for New South
Wales v Trethowan (1932) .The government of New South Wales was not free to
introduce the 1931 Bill and to attempt to enact it other than in conformity with
the requirements of section 5. Section 5 required that the legislature compliedwith the ‘manner and form’ provisions in force. The specific ‘manner andform’ provisions were those laid down in the 1929 Constitution Act, and theserequirements could not merely be ignored by the subordinate legislature.
52In
the High Court of Australia in the Trethowan case, Rich J denied the
proposition that the New South Wales Parliament had unlimited sovereignpower. 
A similar constitutional arrangement can be seen demonstrated by the
South African case of Harris v The Minister of the Interior (1952), which tested
the validity of the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951. The SouthAfrica Act 1909, an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament, established theconstitution of South Africa. Section 152 of the South Africa Act provided thatno repeal or alteration of section 35 (relating to the qualification of Capecoloured voters) should be valid unless the Bill was passed by both Houses ofParliament sitting together, and the third reading was agreed to by not lessthan two-thirds of the members of each House. 
In 1931, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the Statute of
Westminster. The Statute of Westminster gave statutory effect to theconstitutional convention which previously governed the relationshipbetween the United Kingdom and its Dominions.
53Section 2 of the Act
provided that:
(1) The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 shall not apply to any law made after
the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion.
(2) No law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of this
Act by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on the
ground that it is repugnant to the law of England, or to the provisions ofany existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to anyorder, rule or regulation made under any such Act, and the power of theParliament of a Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend anysuch Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law ofthe Dominion.
Section 4 of the Act provided that:
An Act of the United Kingdom Parliament passed thereafter shall not extend,or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominionunless it expressly declared in the Act that that Dominion has requested, andconsented, to its enactment.
20752 The Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth and UK), s 3(1), provides that the Colonial
Laws Validity Act 1865 shall not apply ‘to any law made after the commencement of
this Act by the Parliament of a State’.

In 1951, the South African Parliament purported to pass the Separate
Representation of Voters Act, depriving voters in the Cape of the right to vote,disregarding the provisions of section 152 of the South Africa Act. It wasargued before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africathat the Statute of Westminster had conferred full legislative authority, orsovereignty, on the South African Parliament and that, accordingly,parliament was no longer bound by the South Africa Act 1909. The SupremeCourt rejected that argument, stating that the South Africa Act was aconstitutional Act whose provisions could not be indirectly amended by theStatute of Westminster. The Court held that the Statute of Westminster wasnot intended to alter the South Africa Act, but rather to confer additionalpowers on the legislature. Cantilevres CJ drew a distinction between a trulysovereign legislative body, such as the United Kingdom Parliament, and alegislative body which was less than sovereign: ‘... a state can beunquestionably sovereign although it has no legislature which is completelysovereign.’
In Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe (1965), section 55 of the 1946
Constitution of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) required that the appointment anddismissal of the holders of judicial office be vested in a Judicial ServicesCommission. Section 29(4) of the constitution required that amendments tothe constitution required a certificate stating that the amendments had beenpassed by the requisite two-thirds majority.
In 1954, a Bribery Act was passed (with the necessary certificate) giving to
the Attorney General powers to investigate and prosecute allegations ofbribery. In 1958, a Bribery Tribunal was established, headed by a BriberyCommissioner. No certificate was produced as required under section 29(4).The central issue was whether or not the legislature was free to avoidprovisions of the constitution. The Supreme Court held that it could not. Onappeal to the Privy Council, Lord Pearce stated:
... it has been argued that the court, when faced with an official copy of an Act
of Parliament, cannot inquire into any procedural matter and cannot nowproperly consider whether a certificate was endorsed on the Bill. Thatargument seems to their Lordships unsubstantial and it was rightly rejected bythe Supreme Court. Once it is shown that an Act conflicts with a provision inthe constitution, the certificate is an essential part of the legislative process ...The English authorities have taken a narrow view of the court’s power to lookbehind an authentic copy of the Act. But, in the constitution of the UnitedKingdom, there is no governing instrument which prescribes the law makingpowers and the forms which are essential to those powers ... The courts have aduty to look for the certificate in order to ascertain whether the constitution hasbeen validly amended. Where the certificate is not apparent, there is lacking anessential part of the process necessary for amendment ...
These cases demonstrate one fundamental principle: that legislative bodies do
not necessarily enjoy full sovereign power, and that some form of ‘higher law’may control their powers. In each of these cases, the powers of the legislaturesChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Sovereignty
of New South Wales, South Africa and Ceylon (as it then was) had been
established under an Act of the sovereign United Kingdom Parliament. Thatbeing so, the legislative bodies had to comply with the constitutional laws inforce, and failure to do so would give the courts the jurisdiction to declare alegislative act void. 
No one may question the validity of an Act of Parliament
True it is, that what the Parliament doth, no authority on earth can undo.54
As has been seen, an Act will be accepted as valid by the courts provided thatit has passed through the requisite legislative stages and received the royalassent. Early evidence of this fundamental rule is revealed in The Prince’s Case
(1606) :
If an Act of Parliament be penned by assent of the King, and of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons, or, it is enacted by authority ofParliament, it is a good Act; but the most usual way is, that it is enacted by theKing by the assent of the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal and of the Commons... but if an Act be penned, that the King, with the assent of the Lords, or withthe assent of the Commons, it is no Act of Parliament, for three ought to assentto it, [namely] the King, the Lords, and the Commons, or otherwise, it is not anAct of Parliament ... 
Regardless of the subject matter of the Act, it will be upheld by the judges.55
In the time before the 1688 settlement, it was not uncommon for judges to
proclaim that an Act of Parliament could be held to be invalid because itconflicted with some higher form of divine law. Blackstone expressed theview that a human law which conflicted with the law of nature would beinvalid (Commentaries). 
In Dr Bonham’s Case (1610), there is the often-cited obiter dictum of Coke CJ
to the effect that:
When an Act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant,
or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudgesuch act to be void. 
Such views, while appealing to the senses, were of doubtful validity when
expressed and have no authority today. The opinion of Lord Reid expressedin Pickin v British Railways Board (1974) represents the correct contemporary
judicial view on the authority of statute:
In earlier times many learned lawyers seem to have believed that an Act of
Parliament could be disregarded in so far as it was contrary to the law of Godor the law of nature or natural justice, but since the supremacy of Parliamentwas finally demonstrated by the revolution of 1688 any such idea has becomeobsolete.

membership of the European Community.

Non-legal constraints on parliament powers
Political acceptability to the electorate represents the strongest external basis
of restraint. All governments are accountable to the electorate, albeit in termsof a direct vote only periodically. But elections do not of themselves alwaysprovide the means of sanctioning governments, nor do they guarantee thatgovernment invariably acts in accordance with the electorate’s wishes. Stillless can the electorate be regarded as exercising any power to enact law.Whilst the electorate may be correctly regarded as politically sovereign, andcan, at the ‘end of the day’, oust a government which violates its trust, on theexercise of the franchise the electorate conditionally transfers sovereignlegislative power to parliament. As Dicey puts it: 
The electors can in the long run always enforce their will. But the courts will
take no notice of the will of the electors. The judges know nothing about anywill of the people except in so far as that will is expressed by an Act ofParliament, and would never suffer the validity of a statute to be questionedon the ground of having been passed or being kept alive in opposition to thewishes of the electors. [(1898), 1959, pp 73–74]
Whereas, therefore, the power of the electorate is great at the time of a general
election, it is a more limited power during a government’s term of office –most particularly where the government has a strong majority in parliament.It is the task of parliament as a whole, both Commons and Lords, to scrutinisegovernment policy and legislative proposals, and that a range of proceduraldevices exists which facilitate such inquiry. It is through parliament that thewill or wishes of the electorate for the most part find expression. Parliamentmay be seen as the sounding board of the nation. As John Stuart Millobserved:
Parliament ... [is] at once the nation’s Committee of Grievances, and its
Congress of Opinions: an arena in which not only the general opinion of thenation, but that of every section of it, and as far as possible of every eminentindividual whom it contains, can produce itself in full light and challengediscussion; where every person in the country may count upon finding somebody who speaks his mind, as well as or better than he could speak it himself –not to friends and partisans exclusively, but in the face of opponents, to betested by adverse controversy; where those whose opinion is overruled, feelsatisfied that it is heard, and set aside not by a mere act of will, but for what arethought superior reasons, and commend themselves as such to therepresentatives of the majority of the nation ... [(1865), 1958, Chapter V,pp 99–100]
No government can afford to ignore parliament and, ultimately, a
government can be brought down if its policies are such that it loses theconfidence of the House as a whole. On votes of confidence, see Chapter 6. Ifparliament is truly the ‘sounding board of the nation’, parliament must reflectthe political morality within society.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
A further political restraint imposed on governments relates to
international relations. No state today exists in isolation from its neighbours.
The United Kingdom, as with most states, is bound by numerous treatiesunder international law which impose restrictions on the freedom ofgovernment action. Across virtually every aspect of government, suchrestraints are visible: environmental protection, protection of human rights,the protection of children from abduction, the regulation of currencyexchanges, agreements on trade and tariffs and so on. In addition to suchtreaties, the United Kingdom is bound in practical terms by membership ofthe European Union and the United Nations. In theoretical terms, therefore,parliament may remain free to enact laws violating any or all of the UnitedKingdom’s international obligations: in practice, it would not and could not.
ACADEMIC ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
THE TRADITIONAL DOCTRINE OF SOVEREIGNTY
We have seen above that there are a number of sophisticated academicarguments concerning the traditional doctrine of sovereignty. In this briefsection, the differing approaches are brought together for furtherconsideration.
In Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe (1965), Lord Pearce had asserted that: 
The proposition which is not acceptable is that a legislature, once established,
has some inherent power derived from the mere fact of establishment to makea valid law by the resolution of a bare majority which its own constituentinstrument has said shall not be a valid law unless made by a different type ofmajority or by a different legislative process.
Geoffrey Marshall seizes upon this dictum and argues that Lord Pearce:
… seemed to imply equally that both non-sovereign and sovereign legislaturesmay be made subject to procedural rules entrenching parts of the law fromsimple majority repeal.
Marshall goes further and states that:
What can be certainly inferred from Ranasinghe is that a legislature whose
constitutional instrument places procedural restraints upon the forms of lawmaking may not ignore them simply because it is sovereign in the sense ofhaving plenary power to make law for the peace, order and good governmentof the territory. [1971, pp 55–56]
His conclusion from an examination of Ranasinghe is significant:
It helps to confirm that existing English authority does not rule out thepossibility that the Queen in Parliament might legislate so as to provide aspecial manner and form for specified types of legislation. [p 57]
Sir Ivor Jennings has also questioned the orthodox Diceyan view. In The Law
and the Constitution, Jennings distinguishes two situations:
211

If a prince has supreme power, and continues to have supreme power, he can
do anything, even to the extent of undoing the things which he has previouslydone. If he grants a constitution, binding himself not to make laws except withthe consent of an elected legislature, he has power immediately afterwards toabolish the legislature without its consent and to continue legislating by hispersonal decree. [p 152]
But if the prince has not supreme power, but the rule is that the courts accept
as law that which is in the proper legal form, the result is different. For whenthe prince enacts that henceforth no rule shall be law unless it is enacted byhim with the consent of the legislature, the law has been altered, and the courtswill not admit as law any rule which is not made in that form. Consequently arule subsequently made by the prince alone abolishing the legislature is notlaw, for the legislature has not consented to it, and the rule has not beenenacted according to the manner and form required by the law for the timebeing.
The difference is this. In the one case, there is sovereignty. In the other, the
courts have no concern with sovereignty, but only with the established law.‘Legal sovereignty’ is merely a name indicating that the legislature has for thetime being power to make laws of any kind in the manner required by law.That is, a rule expressed to be made by the Queen, ‘with the advice andconsent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and Commons in this presentParliament assembled, and by the authority of the same’, will be recognised bythe courts, including a rule which alters this law itself. If this is so, the ‘legalsovereign’ may impose legal limitations upon itself, because its power tochange the law includes the power to change the law affecting itself. 
Sir Ivor Jennings then illustrates his thesis by reference to Attorney General for
New South Wales v Trethowan (1932) , Ndlwana v Hofmeyer (1937) and Harris v
The Minister of the Interior (1952). Jennings concedes that the decisions do not
necessarily ‘determine the law as it applies in the United Kingdom’, and leaps
from that proposition to one which claims that Dicey ‘failed to prove that thatlaw made the King in Parliament a sovereign law making body’ (1959b,p 156). Such a view is unconvincing. The constitutional justification for thedecisions examined lay precisely in the fact that both the legislatures of NewSouth Wales and South Africa had legislative powers conferred upon them bya fully sovereign superior sovereign body – the United Kingdom Parliament.Only once such complete sovereignty was conferred would the legislativefetters be removed. No such controlling device pertains to the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom itself. 
Arguing from the proposition that parliament may redefine itself – as in
the Parliament Act 1911
57– and may alter its own composition – as in the Life
Peerages Act 1958, Professor JDB Mitchell turns to ‘the purported self-limitations of Parliament’ (1968, p 78). On section 4 of the Statute ofWestminster, Mitchell argues that there are two possible interpretations whenChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
21257 The Parliament Act 1911 reduced the powers of the House of Lords with respect to
legislation. See Chapter 17.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
looked at from the point of view of the United Kingdom judges. The first is
that section 4 amounts to a rule of construction directed to the courts, whichdoes not raise the problem of limitation on parliament. If, however, section 4is understood to mean that parliament has forfeited its legislative capacity –by conferring that capacity on the recipient legislature – then there ‘is quiteclearly a purported limitation of the United Kingdom Parliament’ (p 79).Parliament has redefined itself in a manner which excludes its power tolegislate for the Dominion. 
Mitchell cites in support of the argument the dictum of Lord Radcliffe in
Ibralebbe v The Queen (1964) in which Lord Radcliffe argues that while the
United Kingdom Parliament has the legal power to legislate for Ceylon (as itthen was), to use such power would be ‘wholly inconsistent’ with the powersof legislation conferred on the legislature of Ceylon.
Further authorities could be offered in support of this view. As seen above,
inBritish Coal Corporation v The King (1935), Lord Sankey LC said, in relation to
section 4, that:
... indeed, the Imperial Parliament could, as a matter of abstract law, repeal or
disregard section 4 of the statute. But that is theory and has no relation torealities. [p 520]
Further, in Ndlwana v Hofmeyer (1937), Lord Denning asserted that ‘freedom
once given cannot be revoked’. How should such claims be evaluated? First,
as Dicey made clear, the United Kingdom Parliament – in the exercise of itssovereign power – clearly has the power to abolish itself, or to surrender itssovereignty in favour of another legislature, as in grants of independence. Inpolitical terms, it is, of course, unthinkable that parliament would attempt torevoke such independence. The more troublesome question is whetherparliament retains the capacity to revoke such grants of freedom in legalterms. On this, Dicey was very clear: 
‘Limited sovereignty’, in short, is, in the case of a Parliamentary as of every
other sovereign, a contradiction in terms. [(1898), 1959, p 68]
Dicey exemplifies his view by reference to the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778.
Section 1 of the Act provides that parliament:
... will not impose any duty, tax, or assessment whatever, payable in any of His
Majesty’s colonies, provinces, and plantations in North America ... 
Is this a self-limiting ordinance which fetters sovereignty? Dicey continues:
The point calling for attention is that, though policy and prudence condemnthe repeal of the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778 or the enactment of any lawinconsistent with its spirit, there is, under our constitution, no legal difficulty inthe way of repealing or overriding this Act. If Parliament were tomorrow toimpose a tax, say, on New Zealand or on the Canadian Dominion, the statuteimposing it would be a legal valid enactment. [(1898), 1959, p 67]
Professor RVF Heuston has put forward a ‘new view’ of sovereignty. This
view is summarised as follows:
213

(a) sovereignty is a legal concept: the rules which identify the sovereign and
prescribe its composition and functions are logically prior to it;
(b) there is a distinction between rules which govern, on the one hand: (i) the
composition; and (ii) the procedure, and, on the other hand; (iii) the area of
power, of a sovereign legislature;
(c) the courts have jurisdiction to question the validity of an alleged Act of
Parliament on grounds b(i) and b(ii), but not on ground b(iii); and
(d) this jurisdiction is exercisable either before or after the royal assent has
been signified – in the former case by way of injunction, in the latter byway of declaratory judgment.
58
To what extent is it correct to state that the judiciary may ‘question the
validity of an alleged Act of Parliament’ on the grounds of the compositionand the procedure adopted within parliament? Clearly, as demonstrated byAttorney General for New South Wales v Trethowan (1932) and other comparable
cases, under certain circumstances, it is within the jurisdiction of the courts toquestion whether or not an Act is valid. Those circumstances invariably arisewithin jurisdictions having subordinate rather than supreme legislatures.
In this regard, it may be said that the judges are protecting the sovereignty
of the United Kingdom Parliament by keeping subordinate legislatures withinthe powers conferred. In the United Kingdom, however, parliament isdistinguishable by the absence of any such controlling powers. The orthodoxposition is that expressed in British Railways Board v Pickin (1974), where the
House of Lords, affirming its earlier decision,
59endorsed the ‘enrolled Bill
rule’. Thus, once the Bill has proceeded through parliament, either under thenormal legislative process or under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, andreceived the royal assent, the Bill becomes a validly enacted Act of Parliamentand will not be impugned by the courts. The courts have jurisdiction todetermine what is an Act of Parliament. As has been seen earlier, the courtshave held, by way of illustration, that mere resolutions of the House ofCommons are incapable of having legal effect in the same manner as an Act:Stockdale v Hansard (1839) and Bowles v Bank of England (1913) are clear
authorities for that view. Nevertheless, the procedure adopted by parliamentis not a matter within the jurisdiction of the courts and, on the authority ofPickin’s case, it is not for the courts to go behind the ‘parliamentary roll’ and
inquire into procedural aspects of law making. Sovereign power entails theright to determine composition and procedure.
The central distinguishing feature between the jurisdictions concerned in
the ‘manner and form’ cases and the United Kingdom lies in the existence of ahigher legislative authority. In each case, it was the United KingdomParliament which defined and limited the powers of a subordinate legislativeChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
21458 Heuston, 1964a, Chapter I. See, also, Munro, 1999, Chapter 4. Professor Heuston is
supported in his approach by Jennings, 1959b, Chapter 4, Appendix III; Cowen, 1951;

Parliamentary Sovereignty
body. Only once a parliament enjoys full sovereignty can it be free of such
constraints. The United Kingdom Parliament, by contrast, is ‘uncontrolled’:there exists no higher source of legal authority than parliament itself. For thisreason, to draw an analogy between the legislatures of New South Wales orSouth Africa and the United Kingdom misses the vital dimension of unlimitedpower which is enjoyed by the United Kingdom Parliament.
The last words on the manner and form arguments shall be left to
Professors Wade (1989) and Munro (1999). Professor Wade summarises hisviews on manner and form theorists as follows:
But, in the end, what is the substance of their argument? It is simply their
prediction, made with varying degrees of dogmatism, that the judges will, orshould, enforce restrictions about manner and form and abandon their clearand settled rule that the traditional manner and form is what counts. But if it isvain for Parliament to command the judges to transfer their allegiance to somenew system of legislation if the judges are resolved to remain loyal to the oldone, it is still more vain for professors to assert that they should. The judicialloyalty is the foundation of the legal system and, at the same time, a politicalfact.
Professor Munro finds the arguments as to manner and form equally
unconvincing, stating that ‘the cases cited by the “manner and form” schooldo not, in the end, seem very helpful’.
PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND COMMUNITY
In Chapters 8 and 9, the aims, organisation and law making power of theinstitutions of the European Union are considered, and the relationshipbetween the law of the United Kingdom and European law will becomeclearer after those chapters have been studied. Nonetheless, it is necessary toconsider here, in outline, the impact of membership of the European Union onthe doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. 
The United Kingdom became a member of the European Communities
60
in 1973. The original Communities – now termed European Community –have their own constitutional structure as defined in the Treaties. The Court ofJustice of the Communities has, since the 1960s, asserted the supremacy ofCommunity law over the laws of any Member State.
61As will be seen later,
the Court of Justice has adopted the view that, by becoming signatories to theTreaties, Member States have limited their own legislative competence inCommunity matters, conferring the supreme power to legislate on these

Community for Atomic Energy.

Internationale Handelsgesellschaft (1972).

matters on the law making institutions of the Community. Note that, since the
European Union was established in 1992, the European Community is but apart, albeit the most significant part, of the European Union.
The laws of the Community – the Treaties, laws enacted by the
Commission, Council of Ministers and the European Parliament together withthe judicial decisions of the European Court – are binding on all MemberStates. In the United Kingdom, the acceptance of Community law is under theEuropean Communities Act 1972 – an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament.Accordingly, all Community law derives its force and authority under thisAct, which, as with any Act, has no special legal status within the constitution.However, membership of the Community raises some unique questions forthe sovereignty of parliament.
The principal issue for consideration is the attitude of the judges – both
domestic and Community – towards Community law. It is clear that, from theperspective of the European Court, Community law prevails over domesticlaw, and that domestic legislatures have no power to enact binding legislationcontrary to the requirements of Community law. From the domesticperspective, however, the issue is not so clear-cut. The issues which requireexplanation are:
(a) the extent to which the judges are prepared to accept and apply
Community law;
(b) the manner in which, and extent to which, inadvertent or deliberate
parliamentary Acts are reconciled with the requirements of Community
law; and
(c) whether membership of the Community entails an irrevocable
relinquishment of parliamentary supremacy.
The application of Community law
Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 provides that Communitylaw shall have direct applicability in the United Kingdom:
(1) All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to
time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and
procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as inaccordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be givenlegal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised andavailable in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly; andthe expression ‘enforceable Community right’ and similar expressionsshall be read as referring to one to which this sub-section applies. 
Section 2(4) provides for the primacy of Community law, without expressly
stating that the law of the Community is supreme:Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
216

Parliamentary Sovereignty
The provision that may be made under sub-section (2) above62includes,
subject to Schedule 2 of this Act, any such provision (of any such extent) as
might be made by Act of Parliament, and any enactment passed or to bepassed, other than one contained in this part of this Act, shall be construed andhave effect subject to the foregoing provisions of this section.
Accordingly, all the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions
provided for under section 2(1) are to be given effect by the courts, and section2(4) operates as a rule of construction to the courts to interpret law inaccordance with the requirements of Community law. The manner in whichthe courts have achieved the objectives expressed in the EuropeanCommunities Act 1972 are considered in Chapters 8 and 9 as is the view of theEuropean Court of Justice on the supremacy of Community law. However, itwould be misleading to leave this chapter on the traditional Diceyan theory ofsovereignty without giving some introductory overview of the challengewhich European Community law has posed. The European Court of Justice(the ECJ) adopts as its guiding principle the supremacy of the law of theCommunity. In the Court of Justice’s view, a new legal order has beenfounded, a sovereign legal order within its sphere of competence. Thesovereignty of Community law must, according to the ECJ, be respected byMember States, because through accession to the European Community,Member States have ‘surrendered’ their sovereign power in relation to thosematters now regulated by the Community and Union. 
The European Court of Justice has adopted several means by which to
expand the applicability of Community law and to assert its supremacy. First,the Treaty of Rome, as amended, under Article 10, imposes a duty on allMember States to comply with Community law and not to impede theapplication of Community law. Secondly, Article 249 of the EC Treatyprovides that regulations
63made under the Treaty (in part) ‘shall be binding
in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States’. This principle of‘direct effect’ has been adapted and developed by the ECJ to ensure theharmonious application of Community law throughout the legal systems ofthe now 15 Member States. The doctrine of ‘indirect effect’ is also a conceptdeveloped and expanded by the ECJ, and, as will be seen, has far-reachingimplications for the courts and legislatures of each Member State. Whereprovisions of Community law have direct or indirect effect, the individualcitizen of that state has a right of redress against the Member State, or againstbodies which the ECJ deems to be ‘emanations of the state’, and, under certaincircumstances, the right to compensation from the state. Moreover, while theECJ does not expressly rule on the validity of domestic legislation, it will,when its jurisdiction is raised, rule on the requirements of Community law as

legislation.

interpreted by the Court, and, once that interpretation is received by the
domestic courts, that interpretation must be given effect – notwithstanding
incompatible domestic law. 
While it would be premature to reach firm judgment on the fate of
conventional Diceyan theory before studying the structure, organisation andobjectives of the European Community and Union, some tentative conclusionsmay be suggested. Without rehearsing the arguments set out above, there aretwo differing approaches which may be taken to this conundrum. First, it maybe argued that unreconstructed Diceyan theory remains unimpaired, despiteall appearances and arguments to the contrary, on the basis that the UnitedKingdom voluntarily acceded to the European Community, the force ofCommunity law within domestic law deriving from the 1972 EuropeanCommunities Act. That Act, as seen, is consistent with constitutional law andconvention – not entrenched (nor could it be) – and remains, in legal theory,repealable. From this perspective, parliamentary sovereignty remains thefundamental rule of the common law, and the key to the source of sovereigntylies with the judges. While the judges continue to cling to the rationale thatCommunity law is given effect – even to the point of setting aside legislation
64
– because of the rule of construction provided under section 2 of the EuropeanCommunities Act 1972, judicial loyalty remains unaffected. The clearestevidence for this view is expressed by Lord Bridge in R v Secretary of State for
Transport ex parte Factortame (No 2) (1991), when he states that:
By virtue of section 2(4) of the Act of 1972, Part II of the Act of 1988 [the
Merchant Shipping Act] is to be construed and take effect subject toenforceable Community rights – this has precisely the same effect as if asection were incorporated in Part II of the Act 1988 ...
Moreover, it will be seen from the cases of Macarthys v Smith (1979) and
Garland v British Rail Engineering Ltd (1983) that both the Court of Appeal and
House of Lords, respectively, endorsed the view that, while effect must, in
accordance with section 2(4) of the European Communities Act 1972, be givento Community law, if parliament chose expressly to legislate contrary toCommunity law, that intention would be given effect by the judges. No moreso would this be clearer than if parliament, implausible though thishypothesis may seem, chose to repeal the 1972 Act. 
Alternatively, it could possibly be argued, as HWR Wade has argued,
65
that, for the first time in constitutional history, parliament succeeded in‘entrenching’ a provision (section 2(4) of the 1972 Act), so as to bind futureparliaments. This position, Wade submits, is more than evolutionary: itrepresents more than a rule of construction to be applied by the courts, and israther an illustration of the parliament of 1972 imposing ‘a restriction uponChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
21864 This issue being central to the Factortame cases, discussed in Chapter 9.

to Wade’s analysis.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
the Parliament of 1988’ (p 570). If this argument had substance, there would
indeed have been a ‘revolution’ in the constitution. However, the argumentdoes not convince in light of the dicta of the judges, exemplified by that of
Lord Bridge cited above, which confirms the conventional allegiance of thejudiciary to the United Kingdom Parliament. Moreover, successive casesraising questions on Community law have come before the Court of Appealand House of Lords in which the courts have found the requisiteinterpretative mechanism to accommodate the requirements of Communitylaw as interpreted by the Court of Justice. Judicial interpretative techniquesare the essence of the common law, and the essence of the common law is itscapacity to evolve in accordance with the socio-political and legal domainwithin which it resides. There is little that is ‘revolutionary’ – in relation to theultimate ‘rule of recognition’ of the constitution – in the seminal cases whichhave, for example, in the development of judicial review incorporated intostatutory requirements the common law rules of natural justice and restrictedparliament’s capacity to exclude (or oust) the jurisdiction of the courts, even inthe face of apparently clear statutory language to the opposite effect. In thislight, the insistence on the part of the domestic courts that section 2(4) of theEuropean Communities Act 1972 is a rule of construction to be applied tofuture legislation is hardly ‘revolutionary’ but rather more a recognition of therequirements of the European legal order and the overriding force ofCommunity law for which the 1972 Act provided. 
The preoccupation with parliamentary sovereignty is understandable
given that conventionally sovereignty has, in the absence of a writtenconstitution, represented the ‘cornerstone’ or foundation of the Britishconstitution. Membership of the European Community and Union, and theinsistence of the European Court of Justice on the supremacy of Communitylaw, inevitably challenges traditional understandings of that concept, andraises hitherto unforeseen questions. While traditional Diceyan theory canaccommodate membership of the Community and Union, it can do so only byclearly demarcating, as did its author, the realms of the legal and political.Legal theory resides against the backcloth of the political. Politicalsovereignty, while the United Kingdom remains a member of the Communityand Union, may (arguably) lie in the institutions and law making processes ofthe Community and Union, in which every Member State participates, andwhich is supported by the political will of the citizens of the Member States.That political sovereignty, while membership continues, has a profoundimpact on the extent to which the domestic legislature may legislate overareas within the ambit of the treaties establishing the Community and Union.Thus, as Dicey himself argued, back in the nineteenth century underfundamentally different socio-economic and political conditions, the extra-legal may de facto limit the exercise of sovereign power. This de facto
limitation on legal sovereignty remains ultimately conditional on the political
219

commitment of the United Kingdom government and people to continued
membership of that unique legal order which it voluntarily joined in 1972.
Constitutional reform and parliamentary sovereignty
As noted above, the devolution of power to regional assemblies (in the case ofWales and Northern Ireland) and the Scottish Parliament and the HumanRights Act 1998, which ‘incorporates’ the European Convention on HumanRights into domestic law, both raise the issue of sovereignty. While fulldiscussion of these matters is found in Chapters 12 and 19 respectively, it isuseful here to consider the sovereignty issue. 
Devolution
The Scotland Act, Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act 1998each establish a system of self-government, in differing degrees, for thenations of the United Kingdom other than England. In London, as a pilotproject, a new layer of government has been introduced with the new GreaterLondon Authority and the office of Mayor for London. Since the powersdevolved are the will of parliament, the continued existence of such powerremains dependent upon parliament’s will. This ultimate power to confer andrescind powers granted to subordinate bodies is nothing new: at a lowergovernmental level, there is the granting of limited autonomy, defined by Actof Parliament and controlled by the courts, whereby local authorities havelong enjoyed a measure of self-governance. This statement, however, and thelegal provisions which give it expression, disguise a fundamentally importantfactor in the devolution debate: the dependence of legal-theoreticalsovereignty upon the political sovereignty of the people of the nations.
It is the devolution of legislative power to the Scottish Parliament which
illustrates the complexity of the sovereignty issue most starkly. NorthernIreland, which has enjoyed devolved power in the past (from 1922 to 1972),and, in practice, extensive autonomy from Westminster, has, because of itstroubled history, always been a special case: the partition of the North fromthe South and the Protestant majority in the North has resulted in a highlyUnionist state, notwithstanding the republican ambitions of the IrishRepublican Army and its political arm, Sinn Fein . Wales, on the other hand,
although demonstrating varying degrees of nationalism, has never in recenthistory previously enjoyed self-government, nor expressed a majority opinionin favour of separation from the United Kingdom. By contrast with NorthernIreland and Wales, Scotland retained a strong sense of national identity sincethe union with England in 1707, has a memory of national independence anda distinctive identity expressed through its own legal system. 
The Labour Government, while enthusiastic about devolution to the
regions, was also intent on preserving the United Kingdom and theChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
220

Parliamentary Sovereignty
sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament. This was expressed strongly
in the Government’s White Paper, Scotland’s Parliament :66‘... the United
Kingdom Parliament is and will remain sovereign in all matters.’ Section 28(7)of the Scotland Act gives clear expression to this intention: ‘... this section doesnot affect the power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to make lawsfor Scotland.’ In order to reinforce the Union with Scotland, Scottishrepresentation was not, in the short term, to be reduced at Westminster. TheScotland Act did, however, provide for a future reduction in Scottishrepresentation – with section 86 of the Act providing that the rule thatScotland is to have no less than 71 parliamentary constituencies in theParliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 be amended to remove the over-representation of Scotland at Westminster. 
However, notwithstanding expressions of intent as to continued
sovereignty and adjustments to Scottish representation at Westminster, thepolitical reality of the transfer of legislative power and the authority given tothe Scottish Parliament by virtue of the referendum result paints a ratherdifferent picture. While Westminster retains the right to legislate over‘reserved matters’, which are adjudged to be of United Kingdom-wideconcern rather than national concern, the legislative powers devolved areconsiderable. The theoretical stance that Westminster remains free to legislatefor Scotland over such matters must be in doubt. While Northern Irelandenjoyed devolved power, the convention developed that Westminster wouldnot legislate over areas devolved and, moreover, that domestic affairs ofNorthern Ireland would not even be debated at Westminster. Were the UnitedKingdom Parliament to attempt to legislate over Scottish domestic affairswhich have been devolved to Edinburgh, against Scottish wishes, real conflictwould arise — and no assertions of the sterile sovereignty of Westminsterwould quell political dissent from north of the border. Further, while thegovernment chose to continue the office of Secretary of State for Scotland, hisor her role is purely one which facilitates communication and co-operationbetween Edinburgh and London. Real power lies with the First Secretary — ineffect, if not in name, the ‘Prime Minister’ of Scotland — and it is to him thatthe people look for political leadership in relation to Scottish affairs. The FirstSecretary’s role extends to direct participation in European Union matters,thus giving Scotland an individual voice separate from that of the rest of theUnited Kingdom and one which can represent particular Scottish concernsover all issues falling within the European Union remit.
All of this adds up to considerable legislative and political autonomy for
Scotland and its people. What, then, is left of ‘the sovereignty of the UnitedKingdom Parliament’ in conventional Diceyan terms? Theoretically , two
aspects of sovereignty remain. The first is the ability – notwithstanding thepolitical unreality – to legislate for Scotland contrary to Scottish wishes. The
22166 Cm 3648, para 42.

second is the power to abolish the Scottish Parliament and to reclaim the
powers devolved. Given that the government chose first to seek theendorsement of the people for devolution before devolving power, thelikelihood of either theoretical power being exercised, without the support and
consent of the people of Scotland , is negligible. It will be recalled that, in
MacCormick v Lord Advocate (1953), Lord Cooper questioned the notion that the
Treaty of Union resulted in the adoption of the ‘distinctively English principle[of sovereignty] which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law’.Under Scottish constitutional law, it has always been the case that it is thepeople, and not a parliament, which is sovereign: the Scottish people exercisedtheir sovereignty in choosing to have their own parliament. Whether thefuture entails an independent Scotland outside the United Kingdom, orScotland within some form of quasi-federal relationship with the rest of theUnited Kingdom, must be a matter for the political judgment of the Scottishpeople.
The use of referendums67
The use of referendums raises the question of whether or not parliamentredefines itself to include the people – in a direct expression of their views –for the purpose of legislating. The referendum has been used in relation toconstitutional matters in Northern Ireland in 1973 and 1998; in relation todevolution to Scotland and Wales in 1977 and 1997; in London in 1998 inrelation to the establishment of a directly elected mayor the re-establishmentof a London-wide elected authority; and in the United Kingdom as a whole in1975 in relation to the United Kingdom’s continued membership of theEuropean Communities. The Labour government first elected in 1997 iscommitted to the use of referendum in relation to constitutional reform.Accordingly, further referendums are planned in relation to devolution toEnglish regions, and are expected to be used in relation to reform of the Houseof Lords and a single European currency. However, referendums, asconceived in the United Kingdom, do not affect parliament’s legalsovereignty. While the opinion of the people may be regarded as morallybinding on government, parliament’s sovereignty is preserved throughregarding the result of a referendum as not legally binding the government orparliament. 
The Human Rights Act 1998
As with the devolution of power to the nations, the manner in which thegovernment chose to ‘incorporate’ the European Convention on HumanRights into domestic law is based on the premise of ensuring that parliamentChapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law
22267 See Butler and Ranney, 1994; Marshall, 1997; Munro, 1997.

Parliamentary Sovereignty
retains its sovereignty over law making. Whereas under most constitutions
which include fundamental guarantees protecting human rights, those rightsare protected from encroachment by the legislature, and the legislaturethereby limited in what it may enact – and subject to the rulings of aconstitutional court – the Human Rights Act 1998 utilises a peculiarly Britishdevice which preserves parliament’s theoretical sovereignty. The Act providesthat judges in the higher courts may issue ‘declarations of incompatibility’between statute and the Convention rights incorporated under the Act. Wheresuch a declaration is made, the matter is then transferred to the executive,which may choose whether and how to amend the law to bring it into linewith Convention rights. Further, where proposals for legislation areintroduced into parliament, the relevant minister must declare whether theBill in question accords with Convention rights. If it does not, an explanationas to the necessity for the legislation must be given. While both of thesemeasures undoubtedly improve the protection of rights and generate a morerights conscious society, they fall far short of making individual rights andfreedoms immune from legislative change. Moreover, consistent withconventional constitutional theory, the Human Rights Act 1998 has not beenaccorded any special status: its existence and scope remains – as with otherseminal acts of constitutional import – subject to parliament’s will. 
However, the traditional theory of sovereignty, as applied to the Human
Rights Act 1998, disguises the importance of the constitutional change whichthe Act represents. All aspects of policy and practices of public and quasi-public bodies now fall for scrutiny in accordance with Conventionrequirements. The Human Rights Act has quickly become established at theheart of the legal system, providing a yardstick against which all actions ofgovernment and other public bodies may be judged. Of immediate concernhere is the issue of sovereignty.
While the government adopted a constitutional mechanism which
preserves parliament’s sovereignty, and maintains the conventional (andsubordinate) role of the judiciary, the working of the Act is more subtle thanthe re-statement of sovereignty implies. The judges are under a duty tointerpret legislation in a manner which gives effect to Conventionrequirements, save where such an interpretation is impossible. Here, there is asignificant shift in the process of judicial reasoning which traditionally focuseson interpreting the ‘latest will of parliament’ as expressed in legislation. Therequirement that ministers must state that legislative proposals are incompliance with Convention requirements, coupled with the directive tojudges to interpret in line with Convention rights, gives rights a specialconstitutional, moral and legal status. That the ultimate decision to amend thelaw in line with a declaration of incompatibility rests with the executive andparliament does not suggest a lessening in the importance of rights so muchas an ingenious device by which to keep constitutional fundamentals –sovereignty and separation of powers – intact, rather than turning the
223

constitution on its head by reversing the balance of power between judges and
parliament. Nevertheless, the Act does give to judges an unprecedented scopefor statutory interpretation and development of the common law in line withConvention rights: the extent to which judges grasp the opportunity remains amatter for future evaluation, as does the judgment as to the extent to whichmoral prior restraints have been imposed on the executive and parliament.Chapter 7: Constitutional and Administrative Law

PART III
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND UNION



CHAPTER 8
INTRODUCTION
To understand the origins of the Union, it is necessary to look back to 1945
and a Europe which had been devastated by war: economically, politicallyand socially. In the desire to attain some form of harmony in order toguarantee peace and to rebuild Europe, the movement towards theintegration of European countries was started. The movement took severalforms. In 1948, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) was established with financial aid from the United States of Americain order to restructure the European economies. In 1949, the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation (NATO) was formed as a military alliance between theUnited States, Canada and Europe. 
In 1949, the Council of Europe was established, out of which the European
Convention of Human Rights was born. In 1950, under the leadership of theFrench Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, a plan was devised whereby theraw materials of war, coal and steel, would be placed under the control of asupra-national organisation and, thus, the European Coal and SteelCommunity (ECSC) was established under the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951.The original Member States were Germany, France, Belgium, Italy,Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Initiatives were being introduced toprovide supra-national regulation of the non-military use of atomic energy. Atthe same time, the move towards greater economic co-operation and thecreation of a European trading area was underway. The results of thesedevelopments took the form of the Treaties of Rome signed in 1957,establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the EuropeanAtomic Energy Community (Euratom). 
The EEC had the broadest aims of the three communities, seeking to create
a European common market and close co-operation between Member States.The common market is based on four basic freedoms: of persons, goods,capital and services.
The law relating to the European Community is now a wide ranging
subject. European Community law intrudes upon, and affects, an everincreasing volume of domestic law and now represents an important sourceof law in the United Kingdom. The original treaties establishing the threeEuropean Communities have been much amended. Moreover, in 1992, theTreaty on European Union was signed by the heads of the governments of

Member States. The 1992 Treaty (in force November 1993) brought into being
the European Union, the aims of which go far beyond the original objectivesof the European Economic Community and seek to provide the furtherintegration of the laws and policies of Member States. The 1992 Treaty (TEU1992) also extended the competence of the institutions of the Community. TheTreaty of Amsterdam 1997 amends the EC Treaty and the TEU 1992 andrepresented:
... a new stage in the process of European integration undertaken with the
establishment of the European Communities. [Preamble]
The Treaty of Amsterdam 1997 confirmed the Union’s ‘attachment to the
principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms and of the rule of law’.
2The political objectives of the
Union are extensive, seeking to achieve European economic and monetaryunion, the promotion of economic and social progress, ‘taking into account theprinciple of sustainable development and within the context of theaccomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion andenvironmental protection’, common defence and foreign policy,
3and the
complete elimination of border controls within the Union. These objectives areexpressed in Article 2 of the TEU as follows:
The Union shall set itself the following objectives:
– to promote economic and social progress and a high level of employment
and to achieve balanced and sustainable development, in particular
through the creation of an area without internal frontiers, through thestrengthening of economic and social cohesion and through theestablishment of economic and monetary union, ultimately including asingle currency in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty;
– to assert its identity on the international scene, in particular through the
implementation of a common foreign and security policy including theprogressive framing of a common defence policy, which might lead to acommon defence, in accordance with the provisions of Article 17;
– to strengthen the protection of rights and interests of the nationals of its
Member States through the introduction of a citizenship of the Union;
– to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and
justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunctionwith appropriate measures with respect to external border controls,asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime;
– to maintain in full the acquis communautaire and build on it with a view to
considering to what extent the policies and forms of co-operationintroduced by this Treaty may need to be revised with the aim of ensuringthe effectiveness of the mechanisms and the institutions of the Community. Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Structure and Institutions
The objectives of the Union shall be achieved as provided in this Treaty and in
accordance with the conditions and the timetable set out therein whilerespecting the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 5 of the Treatyestablishing the European Community. 
The principles on which the Union is based are set out in Article 6 of the TEU:
1 The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principleswhich are common to the Member States.
2 The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as theyresult from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, asgeneral principles of Community law.
3 The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States.
4 The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its
objectives and carry through its policies.
The current membership of the Union, with dates of accession, is as follows:
Austria (1995), Belgium (1957), Denmark (1972), Finland (1995), France (1957),Germany (1957), Greece (1981), Ireland (1972), Italy (1957), Luxembourg(1957), Netherlands (1957), Portugal (1985), Spain (1985), Sweden (1995),United Kingdom (1973).

EVOLUTION OF THE UNION
The Treaty establishing the ECSC provided for four institutions which todayform the nucleus of the institutional framework of the Community/Union: theCommission, being the executive body serving the interests of theCommunity; the Council, being the executive representing the interests ofMember States; the Assembly (a non-elected parliament),
5and the European
Court of Justice (ECJ). On the introduction of Euratom and the EEC, separateCommissions and Councils were established, all three Communities sharingthe Assembly and the Court.
Having established three Treaties with different organs and differing
powers, the next logical step was to merge the institutions. This merger cameabout in 1965 (coming into force in 1967), under a Treaty establishing a singleCouncil and single Commission of the European Community: the MergerTreaty. 
2294 Proposals are under consideration for an expansion of the European Union from 15
Member States to 26 or possibly 28: the majority of applicants are Eastern European
States. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Cyprus and Estonia arecandidates for early entry into the Union. Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia andLithuania have also applied for membership. Malta announced, in 1996, that its requestto accede to the Union was suspended. Special arrangements for co-operation betweenMalta and the EU are under negotiation.
5 Note that the Assembly is now known as the Parliament. It became directly elected in
1979. See, further, below.

The current organisation of the Community derives from the increasingly
dynamic movement towards greater economic and political union between
the now 15 Member States. A brief examination of the evolutionary stages inthe Community makes the position clearer.
The original Common Market, created under the European Economic
Community Treaty (EEC Treaty) signed in 1957 – which the United Kingdomjoined in 1973 – has changed markedly. From 1957 until 1987, the EEC Treatyremained unchanged, although membership of the Community expandedfrom the original six
6Members to 12.7
The Single European Act 19868
In 1986, the Single European Act (SEA) was passed.9This Act – a European
Treaty – provided a timetable for realising the objectives of the originaltreaties – namely the free movement of capital, goods, persons and services –by 31 December 1992. In addition, the Single European Act increased thepowers of the European Parliament. The Single European Act also changedthe voting procedure to be adopted in many areas of decision making inEurope. It did this by weakening the requirement of unanimous voting fordecisions made by the Council of Ministers and increasing the extent to whichthe ‘qualified majority voting system’ would apply (see, further, pp 251–53).By doing this, the Single European Act provided that individual MemberStates could be outvoted in decision making, thus making Europe strongerand the power of the individual Member States to block European legislationweaker.
10Furthermore, the Single European Act increased the competence of
the Community institutions, including new areas such as the environmentand regional development policy,
11consolidated the legal basis of the
European Monetary System,12and took steps towards greater political co-
operation and foreign policy making.
The Treaty on European Union 1992 (Maastricht) 
In December 1991, a new agreement was reached by Heads of Government inMaastricht which significantly expanded the aims and objectives of theCommunity. This agreement resulted in the Treaty on European Union (TEU)– the Maastricht Treaty – which was signed in February 1992. It was to comeinto force once ratified (approved) by individual Member States, according toChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

their own constitutional arrangements. Because of difficulties with
ratification,13it was to be November 1993 before the Treaty came into force.
The Treaty, resulting from inter-governmental negotiations, represented a
compromise between the federalists (or ‘integrationists’) and the anti-federalists (or ‘inter-governmentalists’). It needs to be understood that, in thedevelopment of the Community, there has been exhibited a constant tensionbetween those Member States who see the movement towards almost totalpolitical and economic union, whereby the Community would take on thecharacteristics of a federal state, and those Member States (particularly theUnited Kingdom) who have reservations about greater fusion in Europe andwish to retain a higher degree of autonomy from Europe than the federalistswould wish to see. These Member States, the anti-federalists or inter-governmentalists, accordingly resist the drive towards federalism, preferringdevelopment to proceed along more piecemeal lines and to be pursuedthrough inter-governmental agreement rather than movements from thecentre of the Community.
As a result of these tensions, rather than drafting a Treaty to supplement
the existing Treaties and to provide a coherent working ‘constitution’ forEurope, based on the principle of a more federalist Union, the Treaty hasproduced a structure in which the Union is ‘founded on the EuropeanCommunity, supplemented by the policies and forms of co-operation’
14laid
down by the Treaty on European Union. The Treaty has two main sections.The first group of provisions represent a series of amendments to the EECTreaty (and the ECSC and Euratom Treaties). The provisions make it clearthat, in future, the EEC Treaty is to be known as the EC Treaty and theEuropean Economic Community as the European Community. The EC Treatynow comprises the original Treaty of Rome, as amended by the SingleEuropean Act, as further amended by the Treaties on European Union 1992and 1997. Once again, the aims and powers – or competence – of theCommunity are extended, and changes are made in the relationship betweenthe various Community institutions. Consumer protection, culture and publichealth represent three areas over which Community powers have beenextended, albeit to limited extents, and there are restrictions of European-wideharmonisations in these areas. There is further consolidation in some areas, forexample, regional development and the environment. The EC Treaty alsoprovides a framework and timetable for progress towards economic andmonetary union. Article 17 of the revised EC Treaty confers citizenship of theEuropean Union on all nationals of Member States within the Union. 
The Treaty on European Union 1992 involved the creation of the European
Union. The Union – of which the EC forms the central legal and institutionalpillar – has aims broader than the economic core of the EC. Accordingly, the

and, further, Chapter 6.
14 TEU 1997, Article 1; see Curtin, 1993 for a critical account.

second part of the Treaty on European Union provided a framework for co-
operation on future developments. The areas concerned were common foreignand security policy and justice and home affairs. There are now three ‘pillars’which represent the structure of the Union. The first pillar amends the EECTreaty (and renames it the EC Treaty). The second pillar introduces andregulates common foreign and security policy. The third pillar concerns policeand judicial co-operation in criminal matters. The Common Foreign andSecurity Policy and Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matterspillars are, however, fundamentally different from the first. The first pillar,comprising European Community law, is regulated by the institutions of theCommunity – the Council of the EU, the European Commission, EuropeanParliament and the European Court of Justice. In relation to the second andthird pillars, the decision making process is quite different. In relation to bothforeign and security policy and co-operation in criminal matters, decisions areto be reached by way of inter-governmental co-operation. This means thatdecisions will be reached through agreements to co-operate and co-ordinatepolicy – agreements which will require ratification or implementation atnational level. In relation to these matters, in pillars two and three, theEuropean Court of Justice will have no jurisdiction other than where theTreaty so provides. Accordingly, while it may be argued that there is a singlelegal system underpinning the EU, its effects are not uniform across all policyareas.
15
The Maastricht Treaty also introduced two new Community institutions
which are discussed further below. The European Central Bank is given lawmaking and other powers
16and will play a pivotal role in economic and
monetary union. The Court of Auditors, having responsibility for scrutinisingCommunity administration, became the fifth institution of the EC, itsmembers having a six year renewable term of office and being under the samerequirements of independence from governments as the Commission (Article246 of the EC Treaty). Article 8 of the EC Treaty provides that a EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB) shall be established, and a European CentralBank (ECB), whose powers are derived from the Treaty and from the Statuteof the ESCB. The timetable for monetary union was set by the Treaty onEuropean Union 1992, which anticipated that Member States satisfying the‘convergence criteria’ should withdraw their own currencies
17and adopt the
euro in 199918– unless the Member State has derogated (or opted out) fromChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

this provision. Central to this process is the role of the European Central Bank,
which was established under the Maastricht Treaty.19 The Bank is under a
duty to ‘translate the objective [of economic and monetary union] intomonetary targets and to work towards their achievement’. The euro came intoexistence as a currency in 1999. Notes and coins came into circulation inJanuary 2002. The United Kingdom, while meeting the convergence criteriafor joining, has opted out of this scheme,
20but is free to opt in in the future,
and the Labour government intends to take Britain into the economic andmonetary union at the earliest appropriate moment, having established firsthow the initial stage of monetary union is working. 
Monetary union
The Maastricht Treaty involved economic and monetary union as a centralprocess towards further European integration. Jacques Delors, formerPresident of the Commission, envisaged economic and monetary union as the‘left boot and right boot for Europe to wear in its advance towards the evercloser union of the peoples of Europe’.
21
The Treaty of Amsterdam22
While the 1992 Maastricht Treaty established the Union and the principles onwhich it is based, many matters remained unresolved and for futuredetermination. As a result, the Treaty provided for an inter-governmentalconference to be convened in 1996 in order to reach decisions on matterswhich remained outstanding. Paradoxically, while the Maastricht Treaty,particularly in the United Kingdom, was attended by great political debateand controversy, the Treaty of Amsterdam,
23which gives substance to many
of the commitments undertaken in principle at Maastricht, was concludedwith relatively little public debate.
The objectives determined for the 1996 inter-governmental conference
were both to remedy some of the perceived defects of the Maastricht Treatyand to prepare the Union for its proposed expansion to 26 Members. Insummary, the Treaty of Amsterdam marked significant changes in respect offour principal areas:

1998.

(a) freedom, security and justice; 
(b) the Union and the citizen; (c) common foreign and security policy;
(d) the Union’s institutions. 
Each of these is considered below. Since the creation of the European Union,
the original Communities exist side by side with the expanded objectives ofseeking common policies on foreign and security policy and police andjudicial co-operation. The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced significantalterations to the three pillars, in addition to making a number of otherimportant changes which are discussed below. In relation to the structure ofthe Union, the 1997 Treaty transferred aspects of free movement of persons,asylum and immigration out of the third pillar and into the EuropeanCommunity. 
Closer co-operation
The difficulties experienced in accommodating differing perceptionsconcerning the Union, and incorporation into domestic systems of all Unionand Community measures, has led to the adoption of flexibility, under theguise of ‘closer co-operation’. Difficulties over the social protocol, Europeanmonetary union, border controls and common defence policy represent someof the areas over which a lack of unity exists. The Treaty of Amsterdamformalised the concept by inserting a general flexibility clause into thecommon provisions of the Treaty on European Union and also madeprovision for Member States to avail themselves of Community institutionsand procedures, in order to establish closer co-operation between themselves,subsequent to authorisation by the Council and under the preconditions laiddown in Article 43 TEU. The Council acts by qualified majority on a proposalfrom the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.
24
Limitations on the degree of flexibility permissible are provided in Article
11 of the EC Treaty, which provides, in part, that action taken by MemberStates in pursuit of closer co-operation:
(a) does not concern areas which fall within the exclusive competence of the
Community;
(b) does not affect Community policies, actions or programmes;
(c) does not concern the citizenship of the Union or discriminate between
nationals of Member States;
(d) remains within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community by
this Treaty; and
(e) does not constitute a discrimination or a restriction of trade between
Member States and does not distort the conditions of competition between
the latter.Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
23424 See de Búrca and Scott, ‘Constitutional change in the European Union’, in 2000.

Structure and Institutions
Special rules apply to the situation where a Member State considers that the
proposed action would adversely affect important aspects of national policy.Where that arises, a vote in Council shall not be taken on a qualified majority,but rather the Council may request that the matter be referred to the EuropeanCouncil of Heads of Government for a decision to be taken unanimously. Ineffect, this formalises the Luxembourg Accords, on which, see, further, below,and enables a single Member State to block proposals for closer co-operation. 
Freedom, security and justice
Fundamental rights and freedoms
Article 6 of the TEU provides that:
1 The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rules of law, principles
which are common to the Member States.
2 The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as theyresult from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, asgeneral principles of Community law.
3 The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States.
4 The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its
objectives and carry through its policies.
The Maastricht Treaty had reaffirmed the commitment of the Union to
fundamental rights and freedoms as secured under the European Conventionon Human Rights. In order further to advance the protection of rights, theTreaty of Amsterdam introduced three new elements. First, the Treatyconfirmed that the European Court of Justice has the power to review respectfor fundamental rights by the Community institutions. In relation to theEuropean Convention, to which all Member States of the Union, but not theUnion itself are signatories, the Treaty provides that Community law issubject to the European Convention. Limited judicial review is also availablein respect of the third pillar. In relation to matters pertaining to foreign andsecurity policy, however, judicial review does not lie, this issue having provedtoo contentious at the Intergovernmental Conference.
In addition to affirming respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, the
Treaty of Amsterdam introduced a system of penalties for Member States thatfail to respect rights. If the Heads of Government discern a breach of theprinciples of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms, following a proposal by one third of Member States orby the Commission, and after obtaining the assent of the EuropeanParliament, the Council may decide, by a qualified majority, to suspend someof the Member State’s rights, including its voting rights in the Council (TEU,Article 7). In addition, admission to membership of the Union is dependentupon applicant states demonstrating a commitment to individual rights.
235

Freedom from discrimination 
Article 13 of the EC Treaty provides for non-discrimination in relation to sex,
racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.Measures to combat discrimination under Article 13 have been undertaken bythe Council of the EU. The resultant Directives are capable of being directlyenforceable by individuals.
25
Freedom of movement and law enforcement
Under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, Justice and Home Affairs represented thethird pillar, and were, accordingly, to be regulated under the inter-governmental decision making process, rather than under Community law.Under the Maastricht Treaty, 11 areas of policy fell for decision:
(a) asylum policy; 
(b) rules on external borders of the Member States;(c) immigration policy and policy regarding nationals of third countries;(d) conditions of entry and movement by non-EU citizens within the EU;(e) conditions of residence of the above;(f) combating drug addiction;(g) combating fraud on an international scale;(h) judicial co-operation in civil matters;(i) judicial co-operation in criminal matters;(j) customs co-operation;(k) police co-operation in relation to terrorism, drugs and other international
crime.
However, the 1997 Treaty significantly amended the third pillar, transferring
many powers from the Union to the European Community. Title IV of the ECTreaty regulates visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to thefree movement of persons. 
The transfer of power from the third pillar to the Community represents
one of the most significant changes introduced under the Treaty ofAmsterdam. Whereas under the third pillar, regulation is by way ofconventions agreed through the inter-governmental process, the transfermeans that this area is now regulated under Community law by way ofregulations or directives. The European Court of Justice has jurisdiction, albeitlimited, to review the decisions of domestic courts of last instance, in relationto these matters. On the role of the ECJ, see, further, below.
26Furthermore, the
Commission is given the sole right of initiative in respect of such issues, withthe exception of matters relating to the abolition of controls at internalborders. Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

and justice and police and criminal matters, see Lyons, ‘Variable geometry in the Court
of Justice’, in de Búrca and Scott, 2000.

Structure and Institutions
The Schengen Agreement, which provided for the abolition of border
controls between the Union and participative Member States, discussed
further below, was also formally incorporated into Community law via aprotocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Before the Treaty entered intoforce, it was necessary to identify those issues of the Schengen acquis
27which
related to crime and police matters, which were accommodated in the thirdpillar, and those relating to free movement of persons, which became mattersof Community law in the first pillar. Special provisions relate to Denmark,Ireland and the United Kingdom. All three countries have formally derogatedfrom these measures, because of their special geographical boundaries.Iceland and Norway are to be associated with the provisions on the basis oftheir existing agreements with Schengen members, but are free to revoke all orpart of the protocol. In relation to Title IV of the EC Treaty, on an area offreedom, security and justice, and on police and judicial co-operation incriminal matters, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom have negotiatedspecial conditions. They may join in the future and may decide to participatein Union initiatives, thereby demonstrating the necessary flexibility whichexists in relation to some areas of decision making.
The Court of Justice has examined the compatibility with Community law
of national legislation governing identity checks on citizens when crossingfrontiers. It has ruled that the right of freedom of movement is notunconditional, and that, until all Member States are required, throughharmonisation of laws provisions, to abolish all controls at frontiers, they areentitled to require that the person seeking entry is able to establish that he orshe has the nationality of the Member State.
28
The third pillar as amended: police and judicial co-operation
In respect of the third pillar, following reform, a number of amendments maybe noted. First, the European Parliament is to have a role through therequirement to consult. Secondly, the European Commission now has the soleright of initiative. Thirdly, the Court of Justice is given limited jurisdiction toreview the legality and interpretation of acts, and to give preliminary rulings,provided that each Member State has individually accepted its jurisdiction.
Furthermore, the Treaty of Amsterdam introduces a new form of law
making in respect of the third pillar. Formerly, aspects of Justice and HomeAffairs were regulated under Conventions signed by the Member States, butrarely ratified, and hence of limited value. Under the new arrangements, a‘framework decision’ is to be introduced. Similar to a directive, a framework
23727 The Schengen acquis is defined in an Annex to the Treaty as comprising: the Schengen
Agreement of 1985; the implementing Convention of 1990; Accession Protocols and
Agreements; decisions and declarations adopted by the Executive committee; actsadopted by the organs on which the Community has conferred decision makingpowers.

238decision is aimed at harmonising laws between Member States, and is binding
on the objective to be achieved, whilst leaving a measure of discretion inrelation to the methods adopted to achieve the objective. However, unlikedirectives, the framework decision is stated not to have direct effect – see,further on this, Chapter 9.
The Union and the citizen
The Treaty of Amsterdam reaffirms citizenship of the Union introduced bythe Maastricht Treaty: ‘Citizenship of the Union shall complement and notreplace national citizenship.’
29
Citizenship of the Union, and its consequences as determined by the
European Court of Justice, is likely to have an increasingly significant impacton domestic rules, and on the supremacy of Community law. In Maria
Martinez Sala v Freistaat Bayern (1998), the Court, on a reference under Article
177 (now Article 234), was called upon to rule on the definition of worker, andthe impact of citizenship of the Union on the rights of workers to familybenefits. Mrs Sala, a Spanish national, had lived in Germany since 1989 butdid not have German nationality, a residence entitlement or a resident permitwhich would have entitled her to benefits. The Court of Justice ruled thatCommunity law does not prevent a Member State from requiring nationalsfrom other Member States lawfully resident in its territory to carry adocument certifying their right of residence provided that the Member State
imposes the same requirement on its own nationals. However, to require non-nationals, but not nationals, to possess a residence permit in order to qualifyfor benefit represented unequal treatment which amounted to discriminationunder Article 6 of the EC Treaty (now Article 12).
One of the principal concerns over the relationship between the citizen
and the Union has been the perception that the Union is remote, lacking insufficient democracy, and overly complex. The principle of subsidiarity,discussed below, is one means by which Member States may retain a measureof control over decision making in areas which otherwise would fall toCommunity control. In order to clarify the principle of subsidiarity, and therelated concept of proportionality, the Treaty of Amsterdam included aprotocol which has legal status. Accordingly, whereas subsidiarity wasformerly considered to be a guiding, but non-legal, and unenforceable,principle, it now has legal force.
30
The Treaty of Amsterdam also strives to promote openness and
accessibility for the citizen.31A right of access to Council, Parliament and
Commission documents has been provided. The right of access to informationfounded the basis for an application for annulment of a Commission decision
29 EC Treaty, Article 17.
30 See de Búrca, 1998.
31 See Dyrberg, 1999.

Structure and Institutions
in 1996 confirming its refusal to grant access to certain documents.32The Code
of Conduct drawn up to give effect to the right of access states that ‘the public
will have the widest possible access to documents held by the Commissionand the Council’. The factors which may be relied on for rejecting a request foraccess include refusal where disclosure would undermine the protection ofthe public interest (public security, international relations, monetary stability,court proceedings, inspections and investigations, the protection of theindividual and of privacy, the protection of commercial and industrial secrecy,the protection of Community financial interests, and the protection ofconfidentiality, including the confidentiality of the institutions’ proceedings).Where exceptions are pleaded by an institution, those exceptions must beinterpreted strictly. Further, reasons must be given for the refusal. Merely tostate that the institution relies on an exception is inadequate. In Interpoc Import
und Export GmbH v Commission, the Court had occasion to rule on the refusalto disclose information by the Commission which relied on the public interestin relation to court proceedings. The Court ruled that the access to informationprovisions were designed to make: 
... the Community more open, the transparency of the decision making process
being a means of strengthening the democratic nature of the institution and thepublic’s confidence in the administration.
Where the Commission relied on the exception relating to court proceedings,
it could not use that exception to exclude documents drawn up in connectionwith a purely administrative matter. The decision was annulled.
Common foreign and security policy
The second pillar of the Union structure established under the MaastrichtTreaty 1992 is that of Common Foreign and Security Policy, and representsone of the most politically difficult areas of the Union. Title V of the TEUregulates the matter. Article 13 of the TEU provides, in part, that:
1 The European Council shall define the principles of and general guidelines
for the common foreign and security policy, including matters with
defence implications.
2 The European Council shall decide on common strategies to be
implemented by the Union in areas where the Member States haveimportant interests in common.
Decisions are to be taken by the Council acting unanimously (Article 23(1) of
the TEU). However, in light of political sensitivities, the Treaty of Amsterdamalso made two concessions to Member States. First, Article 23 of the Treaty onEuropean Union provides for abstentions, which will not prohibit the Unionreaching decisions by a qualified majority. Member States who abstain areunder a duty not to impede the action. Secondly, as noted above, a MemberState may attempt to block decisions on the basis of important national
23932 Case T-124/96: Interpoc Import und Export Gmbh v Commission (1998).

interests. Where this occurs, the matter is referred to the European Council for
unanimous decision. 
The Treaty of Amsterdam also furthered the goal of a common foreign and
security policy. The Secretary General of the Council acts as HighRepresentative for foreign and security policy issues. The Secretary General isto continue to be appointed by governments. In relation to security anddefence and enforcement capabilities, difficulties arise due to the differingmemberships of the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance(NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU). The Amsterdam Treatyenables the Council to take decisions for the Union in relation to humanitarianand rescue tasks and peacekeeping tasks, and enables the Union to avail itselfof the WEU to implement the political decisions relating to these tasks. 
THE TREATY OF NICE 2001
The Nice Treaty, like the Amsterdam Treaty, amends the EC Treaty andTreaty on European Union, reforming the institutions in preparation for theaccession of new Member States. The principal changes are to the size andorganisation of the Commission, revision of the weighted voting system in theCouncil, extending qualified majority voting in Council and the power of co-decision of the European Parliament. The Treaty also changes the distributionof seats in the Parliament after enlargement and makes changes to the Courtof Justice and the Court of First Instance. Also reformed are the ‘enhanced co-operation’ procedures which facilitate Member States’ co-operation indifferent areas even though not all Member States wish to take part.
33
The United Kingdom and Europe
The United Kingdom stood aloof from the early development of theCommunity, rejecting the call of Sir Winston Churchill in 1949 for a ‘UnitedStates of Europe’.
34Instead, Britain formed the European Free Trade Area
(EFTA) together with Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden andSwitzerland. In part, EFTA was formed as a defensive action to fend off thepotentially adverse effects of the free trading area established under the EEC.
By 1961, the Conservative government of Mr Harold Macmillan had
decided to seek entry to the Community, an application which was initiallyblocked by France. It was not until 1972 that the Final Act was signedcontaining the instruments of accession of the United Kingdom along withIreland, Denmark and Norway.

Structure and Institutions
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
Aims and objectives
The original aims of the EEC (now EC) were set out in a Resolution of Foreign
Ministers of the ECSC in June 1955:
The governments of Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg and The Netherlands consider that the moment has arrived toinitiate a new phase on the path of constructing Europe. They believe that thishas to be done principally in the economic sphere and regard it as necessary tocontinue the creation of a united Europe through an expansion of jointinstitutions, the gradual fusion of national economies, the creation of acommon market and the gradual co-ordination of social policies. Such a policyseems indispensable if Europe is to maintain her position in the world, regainher influence and achieve a steady increase in the living standards of herpopulation.
These broadly expressed objectives found expression in Article 2 of the EC
Treaty, which provides that:
The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and
an economic and monetary union and by implementing the common policiesor activities referred to in Articles 3 and 4, to promote throughout theCommunity a harmonious and balanced development of economic activities, ahigh level of employment and of social protection, equality between men andwomen, sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high degree ofcompetitiveness and convergence of economic performance, a high level ofprotection and improvement of the quality of the environment, the raising ofthe standard of living and quality of life, and economic and social cohesionand solidarity among Member States.
Article 3 of the EC Treaty now provides that the activities of the Community
shall include:
(a) the prohibition, as between Member States, of customs duties and
quantitative restrictions on the import and export of goods, and of all other
measures having equivalent effect;
(b) a common commercial policy;(c) an internal market characterised by the abolition, as between Member
States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services andcapital;
(d) measures concerning the entry and movement of persons in the internal
market as provided for in Title IV;
(e) a common policy in the sphere of agriculture and fisheries;(f) a common policy in the sphere of transport;(g) a system ensuring that competition in the internal market is not distorted;(h) the approximation of the laws of the Member States to the extent required
for the functioning of the common market;
(i) the promotion of co-ordination between employment policies of the
Member States with a view to enhancing their effectiveness by developinga co-ordinated strategy for employment;
241

(j) a policy in the social sphere comprising a European Social Fund;
(k) the strengthening of economic and social cohesion;(l) a policy in the sphere of the environment;(m) the strengthening of the competitiveness of Community industry;(n) the promotion of research and technological development;(o) encouragement for the establishment and development of trans-European
networks;
(p) a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection;(q) a contribution to education and training of quality and to the flowering of
the cultures of the Member States;
(r) a policy in the sphere of development co-operation;(s) the association of the overseas countries and territories in order to increase
trade and promote jointly economic and social development;
(t) a contribution to the strengthening of consumer protection;(u) measures in the spheres of energy, civil protection and tourism.
In all the above activities, the Community ‘shall aim to eliminate inequalities,
and to promote equality, between men and women’ (Article 3(2) of the ECTreaty) and to take into account the need for environmental protection.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights
In 2000, the European Council approved the setting up of a conventionconsisting of representatives of the 15 national governments, 30 nationalparliamentarians, 16 MEPs and the Commission, charged with drafting aCharter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union. The European Courtof Justice and the Council of Europe had observer status at the Convention.The draft Charter covers principally civil and political rights, but also extendsto economic and family rights. The Charter is not legally binding.
A UNIQUE LEGAL ORDER
The European Community is the creation of the original EEC Treaty, asamended. Community law, however, is not international law as normallyunderstood in the sense of merely establishing mutual obligations betweencontracting states. Community law involves not only mutual obligationsbetween Member States but also the transfer of sovereign rights to theinstitutions of that system and the creation of rights and obligations for theircitizens, ‘who thereby became subjects of the Community’ (Mathijsen, 1995,p 7). The Community is, therefore, a unique constitutional entity, having itsown institutions and law making powers, capable of creating rights andduties within the legal systems of the Member States, and represents far morethan a mere form of institutionalised inter-governmental co-operation, thesuccess of which rests on the full approval of each Member State. The lawmaking powers of the Community’s institutions, as will be seen below, are farreaching. When duties are imposed on Member States, these may imply rightsfor individuals which may be enforced in the domestic courts and, in respectChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
242

Structure and Institutions
of the duties of Member States, also ultimately in the European Court of
Justice (ECJ), the Community’s judicial forum. 
In constitutional terms, the Community is not a ‘state’, neither is it a
‘federation’, rather it is a unique supranational organisation. When newMember States are admitted to the Union, they become automatically boundby the entire law of the Community – in European terminology, the acquis
communautaire.
36Under international law, when a state becomes a signatory
to a Treaty, it becomes bound by the provisions of that Treaty, but not boundby any acts done under the Treaty before that state’s accession. It is differentwith the Community, and new Member States become automaticallycommitted to the Treaties, all secondary legislation, judicial and non-judicialdecisions made by the institutions of the Community, together with non-binding opinions and resolutions of institutions. The concept of acquis
communautaire was given prominence in the Treaty on European Union 1992,
Articles 2 and 3 of which provide that:
The Union shall set itself the following objectives:
– to maintain in full the acquis communautaire and build upon it with a view
to considering, through the procedure referred to in Article N(2), to what
extent the policies and forms of co-operation introduced by this Treatymay need to be revised with the aim of ensuring the effectiveness of themechanisms and institutions of the Community.
– The Union shall be served by a single institutional framework which shall
ensure the consistency and the continuity of the activities carried out inorder to attain its objectives while respecting and building on the acquis
communautaire .
The status of the Community will become clearer as its structure is examined
in more detail.
The major constitutional issues
From the constitutional law perspective, the issues which require scrutiny are:
(a) the nature of the Community, the institutions and their law making
powers;
(b) the nature and sources of Community law;
(c) the effect of membership of the Union on the constitution of the United
Kingdom;
(d) the relationship between Community law and domestic law.
The allocation of functions between Community institutions and
Member States
In any federal or quasi-federal state or organisation, the functions of the
federal government and the regional governments must be allocated. As
24336 Which, literally translated, means ‘Community patrimony’.

discussed in Chapter 1, the concept of federalism involves the allocation of
powers which may reserve some powers to the exclusive competence of thefederal government, some powers which will be concurrently held by thefederal and regional governments, and some powers over which the regionalgovernment has exclusive competence. In the European Community, themanner in which powers are allocated and exercised is largely determined bythe Treaty provisions. However, in order to achieve a realistic balancebetween Community competence and the autonomy of Member States, theprinciple of subsidiarity has come to play a major role and requiresexamination. While subsidiarity does not effect competence per se , it
significantly affects the manner in which it is to be exercised.
The principle of subsidiarity37
Subsidiarity is a fundamental concept in federal states and the approach tosubsidiarity taken in the Community has been said to be very like theapproach adopted in Germany. The principle of subsidiarity is enshrined inthe treaties, although the precise allocation of powers is not laid down as onemight expect in a constitutional text such as this. The principle of subsidiarityis central to Community law, although doubts remain as to its precisemeaning, as shown below.
Discussion of the principle in the Community context, even before its
incorporation into the Maastricht Treaty, reveal that it is capable of no lessthan 30 different meanings. Designed to determine the appropriate level ofaction across the whole spectrum of public activity, international (in thewidest sense), Community, national, regional and local, it has been invoked inthe Community context to assist in determining the exercise of Communitypowers. In this context, it has been described, variously, as ‘the principle ofnecessity, or proportionality, of effectiveness, an elementary principle of goodgovernment, or simply a principle of good sense’. It has been interpreted asmeaning that the Community should only act:
(a) where the objective cannot be achieved by regulation at national level;
(b) where the objective can be better, or more effectively, achieved by action at
Community level (the ‘efficiency by better results’ criterion); or
(c) where the matter in question can be more effectively regulated at
Community level (the ‘administrative efficiency’ criterion).38
Failure to formulate specific detailed rules regarding subsidiarity led the one
time President of the Court of Justice (1984–88), the late Lord MackenzieStuart, in 1991 to argue that the inter-governmental conference at Maastrichtshould be ‘getting down to the detailed rules of detailed competence’, ratherChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
24437 See Emiliou, 1991, and ‘Subsidiarity: panacea or fig leaf?’, in O’Keefe and Twomey,
1994, Chapter 5; Toth, 1992.
38 Steiner, ‘Subsidiarity under the Maastricht Treaty’, and references therein, in O’Keefe
and Twomey, 1994.

Structure and Institutions
than leaving subsidiarity as a ‘hopelessly ill defined concept’,39but his words
were not heeded. Article 5 of the EC Treaty40provides:
The Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by
this Treaty and of the objectives assigned to it therein. 
In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community
shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and sofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved bythe Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of theproposed action, be better achieved by the Community.
Any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to
achieve the objectives of this Treaty.
The closely related principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are thus both
provided for under Article 5. The Protocol on the Application of the Principlesof Subsidiarity and Proportionality restates the principles, listing guidelines tobe followed in reaching decisions as to whether action should be taken atCommunity level or at national level. Now a clear legal concept, it will be forthe Court of Justice to adjudicate on its scope and application. The Protocolalso makes clear that subsidiarity is a concept which is dynamic and flexible,allowing decisions on the appropriate level at which action should be taken todevelop on a case by case basis. The doctrine of proportionality is one which islargely alien to – until recently – English lawyers (see, also, Chapter 25), butone familiar to European lawyers and one utilised by the ECJ. Sir WilliamWade explains that the principle of proportionality ‘ordains thatadministrative measures must not be more drastic than is necessary forattaining the desired result’.
41The protocol on the application of subsidiarity
also clarifies the distinction between subsidiarity and proportionality.
The application of subsidiarity
Exclusive competence
As the text of Article 5 makes clear, where the Community has ‘exclusivecompetence’, the subsidiarity principle has no application. The Communityhas sole power of decision and therefore no question arises as to whetherothers share that power, or the extent to which they should be entitled to act.However, many issues remain unclear from the text of the Treaty. Forexample, there is no definition as to what areas fall within the Community’sexclusive competence, and the Commission itself has accepted that there was‘no clear line of demarcation between exclusive and shared power’. On theother hand, it is generally accepted that common agricultural and commercialpolicies and aspects of common fisheries policies fall within the exclusive

Proceedings of the Jacques Delors Colloquium, cited in Steiner, fn 38.
40 Inserted by the TEU 1992.
41 Citing Schwarze, p 680; see, also, Boyron, 1992.

competence of the Union. Furthermore, the Commission argued that even
where exclusive power exists, it does not mean that ‘all responsibility for theactivity in question is covered by exclusive competence. The text of the Treatycannot be interpreted so broadly as to leave common sense out of account’.
42
Concurrent powers 
Notwithstanding the above observation, it is the concept of subsidiarity whichlies at the heart of the distribution of powers between Member States and theCommunity – and thus determines the scope of Community powers. Where aMember State has a concurrent power, the power to act remains, so long asthe Community has not exercised that power. However, if the Communitytakes action itself, the power of the Member State is pre-empted, and thepower to act – once pre-empted – remains with the Community.
43Where the
Community has exclusive power, the Member State has no power to actunless the legislation in question contains a specific authorisation by theCommunity in favour of the Member States.
44Secondly, the Court has ruled
that, where the Community has exclusive competence to act but has not soacted and urgent action is needed, the Member States may act as ‘trustees ofthe common interest’.
45Only time, political practice and the jurisprudence of
the European Court of Justice, will reveal which view is correct. JosephineSteiner provides a further argument as to the need for subsidiarity, statingthat the principle of subsidiarity is an essential safeguard to protect theinterests of differing groups and regions within the Community, and that anytransfer of power away from Member States to Europe requires justification:
... if competence is to be transferred to centralised authorities, the transfer must
be justified. The burden is on the Community institutions to show that there isa real need for Community action, by reference to the scale or effects of theproblem, and that the particular action proposed is appropriate and necessaryto achieve specific Community goals. [Steiner, 1996, p 63]
The concept of subsidiarity was debated at the meeting of the European
Council at its summit meeting in December 1992 (the Edinburgh Summit),which resulted in guidelines being laid down, guidelines which now have alegal basis under the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. These aresummarised by Nicholas Emiliou in the following manner:
1 Is the proposed action within the limits of the powers conferred on the
Community by the Treaty and aimed at meeting one or more of the Treaty
objectives?
2 If so, can the objectives of the proposed action not be sufficiently achieved
by Member States?Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

3 If not, what should be the nature and the intensity of Community actions?
[1994, p 76]
Issues of subsidiarity will inevitably fall for the Court to consider. For
example, if the Community legislates on a particular area, a Member Statemay wish to resist that legislation by invoking subsidiarity, and thus theCourt will be obliged to make a decision. The power to do so has beencriticised on the basis that subsidiarity is a political, rather than a legalconcept.
46
THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY
The European Commission47
Originally called the High Authority, the Commission is centrally concernedwith all aspects of Community decision making at all levels and on all fronts:the Commission is the very heart of the Community, exercising both powersof initiative and powers of enforcement. As envisaged by the authors of theoriginal treaties, the Commission, while acting independently of governmentsand in pursuit of the objectives of the Community, would help preserve theinterests of individual Member States. The Commission was intended to bethe engine which drives the Community forward. 
Articles 211–19 of the EC Treaty established the powers of the
Commission. Article 211 sets out the basic powers:
In order to ensure the proper functioning and development of the common
market, the Commission shall:
(a) ensure that the provisions of this Treaty and the measures taken by the
institutions pursuant thereto are applied;
(b) formulate recommendations or deliver opinions on matters dealt with in
this Treaty, if it expressly so provides or if the Commission considers it
necessary;
(c) have its own power of decision and participate in the shaping of measures
taken by the Council and by the Assembly [Parliament] in the mannerprovided for in this Treaty;
(d) exercise the powers conferred on it by the Council for the implementation
of the rules laid down by the latter.
The Commission accordingly has powers of initiative and powers of
supervision and enforcement.
The Commission currently consists of 20 Members, appointed by the
governments of Member States in consultation with one another. The numberof Commissioners may be altered by the Council, acting unanimously.

p 77.
47 EC Treaty, Articles 211–19.

Commissioners must be nationals of one of the Member States and no more
than two may be nationals of the same Member State. The five largest MemberStates (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) each have twoCommissioners, other Member States one. Commissioners are appointed for arenewable five year term of office, and cannot be dismissed during their termof office by governments.
48Commissioners remain in office until replaced, or
compulsorily retired.49The Commission has a staff of approximately 15,000.
Decisions in the Commission are reached by majority voting.
The increasing size of the Community – and its projected further
expansion to a membership of 26 – has led to an examination of the size of theCommission.
50Provided that all Member States ratify the Nice Treaty, with
effect from January 2005, the Commission shall include one national of eachMember State. When the Union consists of 27 Member States, the number ofCommissioners will be less than the number of Member States, being chosenon a rotation system to be devised, on the principle of equality, by theCouncil.
51 The European Parliament has the power, under Article 201 of the
EC Treaty, to pass a motion of censure to remove the Commission en bloc .
However, when, in 1999, allegations of waste and mismanagement in theCommission surfaced, Parliament failed to pass a motion of sanction. In theevent, the entire Commission, including the President, resigned.
Once appointed, Commissioners must act entirely independently of
government: they are not representatives of government. Article 213(2) of theEC Treaty, as revised, provides, in part, that:
The Members of the Commission shall, in the general interests of the
Community, be completely independent in the performance of their duties. 
In the performance of these duties they shall neither seek nor take instructions
from any government or from any other body. They shall refrain from anyaction incompatible with their duties. Each Member State undertakes torespect this principle and not to seek to influence the Members of theCommission in the performance of their tasks.
The Members of the Commission may not, during their term of office, engage
in any other occupation, whether gainful or not.
The Commission is headed by a President, appointed from among the
Commission in common agreement with Member States and subject to theChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
24848 Commissioners can, however, have their reappointment blocked by a government, as
occurred in 1989 when the Prime Minister felt that Lord Cockfield had been over-
zealous in his support of the Community.
49 Article 216 provides that, if a Commissioner no longer fulfils the conditions required for
the performance of his duties, or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct, the Courtof Justice may, on an application of the Council or the Commission, compulsorily retirehim.

approval of the European Parliament. The office is held for a renewable two
year term. The Presidency is the most prestigious job in the EC, carrying withit the responsibility for the sense of direction and co-ordination of effortwithin the Community. The Commission may, under Article 217, appoint aVice President or two Vice Presidents from among its number. The Treaty ofAmsterdam has strengthened the role of the President in several respects.First, in the appointment of Commissioners by Member States, the Presidenthas a right to object to a nominee. Secondly, Article 219 of the EC Treatyprovides that the Commission shall work under the political guidance of itsPresident. 
Organisationally, the Commission is divided into Directorates General,
each headed by a Director responsible to the relevant Commissioner. EachCommissioner holds one or more portfolios, that is to say, specialresponsibility for some area of Community policy, and is assisted by a Cabinetof six. 
The broad and ill defined power conferred under Article 211 of the EC
Treaty and the role of the Commission can only be understood within theframework of the European Union as a whole. It is clear that it is theCommission which is charged with the duty to act in the interests of theobjectives of the Community as expressed in the treaties. It is the Commissionwhich puts forward proposals for decision by the Council of the EU (seebelow), having negotiated widely with representatives of Member States’governments and with interest groups within the Community. The Council ofthe EU may, in some instances, request the Commission to draft proposals,and the European Parliament has always been given the right to request theCommission to submit a proposal for legislation. Where the Commission isunder an obligation to submit legislative proposals within a certain time laiddown in the Treaty, failure to act within that time will render the Commissionliable to a challenge before the ECJ. When such proposals assume the force oflaw, it is again the Commission which is charged primarily with the task oflaw enforcement. 
The Commission’s broad powers of initiative should not be understood to
mean that the Commission has total freedom of action. The working of the ECdepends on a variety of factors, actors and forces. In the final analysis, theCommunity can only be effective in achieving the goals set out in the treatiesif its proposals can carry the support of the Member States. The effectivenessof Community law within the legal systems of all Member States is ultimatelydependent upon the political acceptability of that law. It is for this reason thatthe role of the Commission is so important, for the Commission – having thesole power to formulate proposals for the implementation of Treaty objectives– is responsible for ensuring that proposals have the support of Member Statesbefore they are hardened into law. As originally envisaged by the drafters ofthe original treaties, only a body acting with complete independence wascompetent to negotiate with Member States and formulate acceptable policies.
249

It must be remembered that the Community comprises 15 states of vastly
differing sizes and populations, and that, within these states, there are regionswith differing interests and needs. It is vital, therefore, that there is someguarantee that the interests of the smaller Member States, and regions in allMember States, are protected against the power of the larger states.Accordingly, in the process of formulating policies, one of the Commission’sprincipal tasks is to reconcile the differing interests at stake and to make theresulting law acceptable to all.
52It is for this reason that, as a general rule,
where the Commission drafts a proposal, the Council of the EU, which has theformal law making power, may adopt a proposal of the Commission by a‘qualified majority vote’, but may amend the proposal only by a unanimousvote. 
Where a Member State is in default of Treaty obligations, the Commission
has the power to deal with the breach. Article 226 of the EC Treaty, as revised,specifies the procedure to be followed:
If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an
obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matterafter giving the state concerned the opportunity to submit its observations. 
If the state concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid
down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the Court ofJustice.
Most matters are settled at an early stage – infringements being due not to
wilful disregard of the law, but rather from genuine differences of opinion asto the meaning of requirements, or from administrative delay. Where,however, a Member State fails to fulfil its Community obligations, theCommission will take the case to the Court of Justice. Where the Court rulesthat the Member State is in default of its obligations, the Court, at the requestof the Commission, may impose a financial penalty on the Member State.
The Council of the EU (formerly known as the Council of
Ministers)
Articles 202–10 of the EC Treaty apply here. The Council of the EU has
legislative and executive powers and functions. It is the Council whichdefends the interests of Member States. The Council has no fixed membershipand its composition varies depending upon the subject matter underdiscussion. Accordingly, when the subject on the agenda is agriculture, theCouncil will consist of the Ministers of Agriculture from all Member States,when the subject is transport, the membership will be made up of therespective Ministers of Transport. Article 202 of the EC Treaty, as revised, setsout the powers of the Council:Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
25052 Temple-Lang, J, ‘The European Commission: safeguard for Member States’, European
Law Lecture (Queen Mary, University of London, 5 June 1995).

Structure and Institutions
To ensure that the objectives set out in this Treaty are attained, the Council
shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty:
(a) ensure co-ordination of the general economic policies of the Member
States;
(b) have power to take decisions;
(c) confer on the Commission powers for implementation of rules which the
Council lays down. The Council may impose certain requirements in
respect of the exercise of these powers. The Council may also reserve theright, in specific cases, to exercise directly implementing powers itself. Theprocedures referred to above must be consonant with principles and rulesto be laid down in advance by the Council, acting unanimously on aproposal from the Commission and after obtaining the opinion of theEuropean Parliament.
Article 203 of the EC Treaty provides that:
The Council shall consist of a representative of each Member State atministerial level, authorised to commit the government of that Member State.
The Office of President shall be held in turn by each Member State for a six
month term ...
The Council is the most powerful political institution of the EC, and the
Council has interpreted and developed its role in such a manner so as toincrease its powers. As seen from Article 203, it is the Council which haspower to take decisions, and this represents one of the law making powers inthe Community. While the Council has the majority of power in the lawmaking process, the Single European Act 1986 and the Treaty on EuropeanUnion have extended the powers of the European Parliament in relation tolegislation. See, further, below. 
When the Communities (now Community) were originally established, it
was envisaged that the role of the Council would decline as Member Statesdeveloped mutual trust, and that much of the running of the Communitieswould be in the hands of the Commission. It was also felt that governmentswould become less concerned about their own state’s sovereignty and let theCommunities grow in a supra-national way under the direction of theCommission. Neither of these two predictions has fully taken place, and theincrease in the power of the Council has been at the expense of the power ofthe Commission.
The voting system for decision making53
Central to Community development is the voting system used in the Council.The Treaty provides for three basic methods by which the Council can reach adecision: unanimously, by qualified majority vote or by a simple majorityvote. Unanimity is normally required where a new policy is to be initiated or
25153 See Morner, ‘The conflicts inherent in enlargement – is history catching up with the
European Union?’, in Butterworths, 1994.

the existing policy framework is to be developed or modified. Unanimity is
also required when the Council wishes to amend a Commission proposalagainst the wishes of the Commission. While the Union and Community restson consensus, and there is little point in adopting a procedure which willcause national parliaments’ resentment or reluctance on the part of stateauthorities to implement decisions, a balance is needed between respectingthe interests of the Member States while not impeding Communitydevelopment. 
Article 205 of the EC Treaty states that, unless otherwise provided in the
Treaty, that is to say, under specific articles, the Council shall act by majorityvote. In some specific cases the Council is required to act by a qualifiedmajority, for which purpose the votes of Member States are weighted, thelargest states having a weighting of ten, the remaining, according to size,eight, five, four, three or two. Where the Council adopts a matter on aproposal from the Commission, 62 votes are required (Article 205). Whereunanimity is required, the abstention of a Member State shall not prevent theCouncil adopting a matter (Article 205). The voting system was designed inorder to minimise the circumstances in which one state could blockCommunity progress. It became clear in the 1960s, however, that this wasunworkable – most notably when France refused to co-operate in anydecisions and caused a constitutional crisis. 
The outcome of the crisis was an agreement contained in what is known as
the Luxembourg Accord of 1966, which provided that:
Where in the case of decisions which may be taken by majority vote on a
proposal from the Commission, very important interests of one or morepartners are at stake, the Members of the Council will endeavour, within areasonable time, to reach solutions which can be adopted by all Members ofthe Council while respecting their mutual interests and those of theCommunity in accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty. [ Bulletin of the European
Community 3/66, p 5]
The French government insisted that where very important state interests are
at stake, the discussion should continue until unanimous agreement is reached.
This Accord had no formal legal status. It was an informal agreement, and
probably unlawful. However, the Accord profoundly affected decision
making, and the French amendment has been interpreted to mean that anystate has the right to exercise a veto on questions which affect its vital nationalinterests, and it is for the states themselves to determine when such interestsare at stake. However, this does not mean that whenever a Member Stateasserts that a matter is a ‘matter of vital national interest’ that the Communitywill accept the statement. For example, in 1982, the United Kingdom wasopposed to a decision on agricultural prices, and claimed that this was amatter of vital national interest: the Council, however, refused to accept theplea.
54Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, however, the issue of importantChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
25254 See (1982) The Times , 19 May.

Structure and Institutions
national interests has been resurrected and formalised in the EC Treaty in
relation to the provisions for closer co-operation. As noted above, Article 11 ofthe EC Treaty, provides that, in relation to authorisation by the Council formeasures aimed at closer co-operation between Member States, where aMember State raises the objection of important national interests, the Councilshall refer the matter to the European Council for unanimous decision. As theEditorial notes, ‘predictions of the demise of the Luxembourg Compromisewere thus distinctly premature: it has been given a new lease of life, no longerin the demi-monde of political deals but as part of the legal machinery of theEC Treaty’.
55
The Treaty of Amsterdam made limited reforms to the voting system. The
use of qualified majority voting is extended to most of the new Treatyprovisions: those relating to incentives in employment and social matters,equal opportunities, social exclusion, public health, anti-fraud measures,openness and the outermost regions. Of the major existing provisions of theTreaty, the research framework programme is under qualified majorityvoting, and qualified majority voting may be used in relation to decisionsunder the second pillar, common foreign and security policy. The Treaty ofNice makes provision for the voting in Council with effect from January2005.
56Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom shall have 29 votes
each, Spain 27, the Netherlands 13, Belgium, Greece and Portugal 12, Austriaand Sweden ten, Denmark, Finland and Ireland seven votes, and Luxembourgfour votes. To adopt a measure proposed by the Commission there must be atleast 169 votes in favour cast by a majority of the Members. In relation to othermatters 169 votes are required, cast by at least two-thirds of the Members.
57
The Council represents a major law making body within the Community.
The legislative capacity of Council is limited by the Commission’s power ofproposal, although Article 208 does provide the means whereby the Councilmay request the Commission to undertake enquiries the Council considersdesirable for the attainment of common objectives, and to submit proposals tothe Council.
Because the Council has a fluctuating membership and is not permanently
in session,
58the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) acts as
the permanent body engaged in Council work (Article 207 of the EC Treaty).The Committee is divided into two: the first Committee dealing with socialaffairs and transport, and the second dealing with foreign affairs, economicand financial affairs. Because agriculture is so central to the Community, it isserved by a separate Committee on Agriculture. Beneath this structure is acomplex structure of committees, dealing with every subject.

The European Parliament59
Originally called the Assembly, Article 189 of the EC Treaty provides that:
The Assembly which shall consist of the peoples of the states brought together
in the Community, shall exercise the advisory and supervisory powers whichare conferred upon it by this Treaty.
Members of the Assembly, now Parliament, were initially delegates
designated by the parliaments of Member States. In constitutional terms, thedelegates had a dual mandate: that of membership of both the domestic andEuropean Parliaments. The Treaty, however, envisaged that the Assemblyshould draw up proposals for direct elections and that the Council would laydown the appropriate provisions, which it would recommend to MemberStates for adoption. It was to be in 1976 that agreement could be reached onthe proposals drawn up in 1960, and only in 1979 did direct election take placein the United Kingdom. The Council Decision and Act of September 1976 onDirect Elections simply stated that the representatives in the EuropeanParliament of the peoples of the states brought together in the Communityshall be elected by direct universal suffrage.
60 The European Parliamentary
Elections Act 1999 regulates elections to the European Parliament in theUnited Kingdom.
Article 189 of the EC Treaty provides that the number of members shall
not exceed 700. Seats in the European Parliament, the name formally adoptedin 1962, are allocated according to the size of population of the Member States,although there is no absolute equality in voting powers. For example,Germany now has 99 seats and France, Italy and the United Kingdom nowhave 87 seats, whereas Luxembourg has six seats; although the population ofthe United Kingdom is 150 times that of Luxembourg, yet the number of seatsis less than 14 times that of Luxembourg.
61Representative are elected for a
term of five years.62
An elected European Member of Parliament may also be a Member of the
national parliament. This arrangement has both advantages anddisadvantages. On the one hand, it facilitates close links being maintainedbetween the two parliaments, on the other hand, retaining a dual mandatemay involve a conflict of interests.
63
Under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999, the United
Kingdom is divided into electoral regions. England is divided into nine,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each constitute a single electoral region.Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

three Members of Parliament were also Members of the European Parliament.

Structure and Institutions
The number of MEPs elected in the United Kingdom is 87, of whom 71 are
elected for England, eight for Scotland, five for Wales and three for NorthernIreland (s 1). With effect from January 2004, the number of United Kingdomrepresentatives will be 72.
64
The Members of Parliament do not sit in groupings organised by
nationality but rather by political party groupings. Article 191 of the Treatyrecognises the importance of political parties as ‘a factor for integration withinthe Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and toexpressing the political will of the citizens of the Union’. The major politicalparties are the Socialists, European Peoples’ Party, European Democrats,Communists and Liberals. Unless otherwise provided for under the Treaty,the Parliament acts by an absolute majority of the votes cast.
65
The European Parliament is required to hold an annual session, and may
meet in extraordinary session at the request of a majority of its Members or atthe request of the Council or of the Commission.
66In practice, the Parliament
meets approximately 12–14 times a year for a few days per session. Membersof the Commission may attend all parliamentary meetings and are entitled toaddress the Parliament.
67The Parliament holds plenary sessions in
Strasbourg, committee meetings and additional plenary sessions in Brusselsand has its secretariat based in Luxembourg. Much of the work of Parliamentis undertaken by committees on, for example, agriculture, legal affairs and soon. Before a matter goes before Parliament sitting in plenary session, it willnormally be considered by the relevant standing committee. 
The original intention in relation to Parliament’s function was that it would
be a ‘supervisory and advisory’ body, with no legal effect being attached to itsdeliberations. Under specific Treaty articles, the Council of the EU is obliged toseek the advice of the Parliament, and failure to consider Parliament’s viewwould cause the Council to be in violation of an essential proceduralrequirement of Community law, and could cause the decision of the Council tobe declared void by the European Court of Justice.
68As will be seen, the
powers of the European Parliament have been increasing since 1986 (under theSingle European Act 1986), but even now it remains a very differentconstitutional institution from that of domestic parliaments.
The European Parliament can adopt its own ideas and try to persuade the
Commission to adopt them. Usually this takes the form of an initiative report– around 100 a year are approved by the European Parliament. However,Parliament has no power to insist that the Commission adopt a proposal fromParliament – the right of initiative is firmly in the hands of the Commission

itself, other than where the European Parliament or the Council requests a
proposal from the Commission.
The European Parliament has decision making powers regarding the
annual budget. This power in relation to the Community budget has alwaysbeen of significance. The revenue of the Community comes primarily fromagricultural levies, customs duties on imports from outside the Communityand value added tax (VAT) levied within the Community. When the draftbudget is drawn up by the Council, after receiving proposals from theCommission, it is then submitted to Parliament which has power to accept,amend or reject the budget. The right of amendment depends on the type ofexpenditure proposed. There are two categories of expenditure: compulsoryexpenditure, which necessarily arises from Treaty provisions, and non-compulsory expenditure. The non-compulsory expenditure can be amendedbut, in relation to compulsory expenditure, Parliament may suggestamendments but the Council of the EU has the last word.
Parliament has the power to reject the Community budget in total if there
are ‘important reasons to do so’: Article 272 of the EC Treaty. There must be amajority of votes in Parliament and also two thirds of the votes cast. Rejectionof the budget occurred in 1979, when a new budget was subsequently drawnup.
Parliament has the right to question the Commission and Council,
69and
replies are given both orally and in writing, and published in the Official
Journal of the European Communities . Parliament also has the power to dismiss
the entire Commission on a vote of censure if the vote is carried by a twothirds majority of the votes cast, a vote which must represent an overallmajority of the votes in Parliament.
70If the vote is carried, the Commission
resigns as a body. However, in one sense, the power is too great to beeffective, for Parliament has no power to force the incoming Commission toadopt a different policy from that of its predecessor. Under the TEU, however,nominations for appointment to the Commission must hereafter be approvedby Parliament.
71
Extension of Parliament’s powers
The powers of the European Parliament have been extended significantly. Thelegislative process is now more complex and, in specific instances, it isnecessary to consult the substantive Articles of the Treaty in order to establishthe precise procedure to be followed.
The co-operation and co-decision procedures
The Single European Act 1986 provided for a new ‘co-operation procedure’,which applied to many, but not all, instances in which the Treaties requireChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
25669 EC Treaty, Article 197.
70 EC Treaty, Article 201.

Parliament to be consulted. This procedure, which gave the Parliament the
power to propose amendments to legislative proposals, has been largelysuperseded by the co-decision powers introduced at Maastricht. The co-operation procedure does continue to apply, however, to some issues relatingto European monetary union. 
Under the Treaty on European Union 1992, Parliament was given legal
powers in addition to its consultative powers.
72The Parliament was also
given powers of co-decision in relation to the internal market, education,consumer affairs and other areas. The Treaty on European Union 1992 furtherextended Parliament’s role in the legislative process.
73The procedure adopted
extends the role and power of Parliament to a considerable extent – althoughnot to the point where it can be equated with the normally understoodmeaning of a democratic legislature. Articles 251–54 of the EC Treaty regulatethe legislative process and consolidates the provisions relating to theEuropean Parliament.
Articles 251 and 252 of the EC Treaty, as revised, define the procedure to
be followed where references are made to it in the substantive Treaty articles.The 1997 Treaty has considerably extended the Parliament’s right to co-decision with the Council. The new areas to which the co-decision procedureapplies include: non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality; freedom ofmovement and residence; social security for migrant workers; right ofestablishment for foreign nationals; rules governing professions;implementation of transport policy; provisions arising from the socialprotocol; decisions implementing the Social Fund; vocational training; publichealth; provisions relating to trans-European networks; decisionsimplementing the European Regional Development Fund; research; theenvironment; development co-operation; equal opportunities and equaltreatment; openness; measures to counter fraud; statistics; creation of anadvisory body on data protection; incentive measures for employment;customs co-operation; incentive measures for combating social exclusion.
74
Where Parliament is given a role in the decision making process,
Parliament will give an opinion on a Commission reading. The first reading isconcluded when the Council adopts a common position. A time limit thenapplies to Parliament reaching its decision, on the expiry of which the Councilmay adopt the measure in accordance with its common position. Article 251requires that, at second reading, Parliament must act by an absolute majorityof its Members in order to reject or amend the common position adopted bythe Council. If the Parliament rejects the common position, then the measure

fails completely. Parliament also has the right to request the Commission to
submit legislative proposals, although this power is limited.75There is no
power given to Parliament to draft a proposal itself if the Commission doesnot act within the time limit suggested by the Parliament. 
The Treaty on European Union 1992 provided that Parliament shall
appoint an ombudsman to inquire into allegations of maladministrationwithin the Community.
76Article 195 of the EC Treaty, as revised by the
Amsterdam Treaty, now regulates this matter. Parliament may also establishcommittees of inquiry to investigate allegations of maladministration.
77 It was
a committee of inquiry which led to the downfall of the Santer Commission in1999.
78
How should the Parliament’s role be evaluated? Prior to the extension of
Parliament’s legislative role under the Single European Act and the Treaty onEuropean Union, in many instances, the European Parliament had limitedcontrol over what happened after it had been consulted. The Council could inmany areas, if acting unanimously, ignore the views of Parliament. Nor wasthe Council bound by Opinions issued by the Parliament. If a matter requiredurgent attention, the Council might act without gaining Parliament’s opinion.Parliament was not consulted on all Council legislation. For example,traditionally, no consultation was required on external trade agreementswhich the Council concluded on behalf of the Member States. 
The Single European Act gave the Parliament power to agree or to veto
special trade agreements. The Single European Act also extended Parliament’srole in the admission of new Member States, whose admission must beapproved by a majority, thus giving the Parliament a power of veto. WhereParliament is given a role in the legislative process under Article 251, asrevised, its role is subject to the limitations of being required to act by anabsolute majority – rather than simple majority – of its Members, and the timelimits imposed, although extendable (Article 249), represent a real restrictionon what Parliament may be expected to accomplish – particularly given therelative infrequency of its meetings, and the short duration of its sessions. 
With the powers of Parliament enhanced under the Single European Act
and the Treaties on European Union and, most significantly, the extensiveincrease in the areas over which the Parliament has a right of co-decision withthe Council introduced by the Maastricht Treaty but reformed under theAmsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament has gradually been given thepowers needed to offset the perception that the Parliament lacked a real rolein legislation, including a properly functioning veto power.Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The European Council79
The year 1974 saw the formalisation of an informal arrangement which had
pertained from the 1960s. A communiqué was issued at the Paris Summit ofHeads of Government and Foreign Ministers of Member States, of which thefollowing is the most important:
Recognising the need for an overall approach to the internal problems
involved in achieving European unity and the external problems facingEurope, the Heads of Government consider it essential to ensure progress andoverall consistency in the activities of the Community and in the work onpolitical co-operation.
The Heads of Government have therefore decided to meet, accompanied by
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, three times a year and, whenever necessary, in theCouncil of the Community and in the context of political co-operation.
The constitutional implications of the communiqué are twofold. In the first
place, the communiqué represented an adjustment of the institutionalarrangements of the Community (now Union) which were brought aboutwithout recourse to the formal Treaty amending provisions, a mechanismdemonstrating the dynamic and flexible means by which the Community andUnion can evolve. Secondly, the motivation behind the communiqué lay inthe perception that the role of the Commission had been reduced by theMember States’ insistence on protection of their national interests, asexemplified in the increasing use of the unanimous vote in Council which hadthe effect of stultifying the growth of the Community. The first officialrecognition of the communiqué, which had no legal standing, is found in theSingle European Act 1986,
80which specified the membership of the European
Council and reduces the minimum number of annual meetings from three totwo. The Treaty on European Union confirms this arrangement and Article 4of the Treaty states that:
The European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for
its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof. 
...The European Council shall submit to the European Parliament a report after
each of its meetings and a yearly written report on the progress achieved bythe Union.
The Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers accordingly meet twice a
year, together with the President of the Commission, two Members of theCommission and officials. A primary purpose of the meetings is to revieweconomic and social matters such as inflation, economic growth,unemployment, the European monetary system, international political issues,reform of the Common Agriculture Policy and constitutional issues such asapplications for membership of the Union and political integration.
25979 Not to be confused with the Council of the EU.
80 EC Treaty, Article 28.

The decisions reached are political, the European Council having no law
making powers. The impact on the Commission, Council of the EU and
Parliament are of constitutional significance. The Commission loses its ownpower of initiative, the Council of the EU loses power because decisions arereached at Head of State level, and the Parliament is bypassed in the decisionmaking process.
The Court of Auditors
The Court of Auditors originates in the Financial Provisions Treaty of 1975 buthas now been given formal recognition as an institution of the EuropeanUnion under the Treaty on European Union 1992: see Articles 246–48 of theEC Treaty. The Court of Auditors comprises 15 members, appointed undersimilar terms and conditions to judges of the European Court of Justice. Theterm of years is six, and Members are under a duty to act completelyindependently in the performance of their duties and to act in the generalinterests of the Community. A President of the Court, appointed for arenewable term of three years, heads the Court of Auditors. It is the Court ofAuditors which has responsibility for monitoring the expenditure of theCommunity. It carries out audits, examining the accounts of all revenue andexpenditure of the Community. At the end of each financial year, the Court ofAuditors is under a duty to draw up an Annual Report which is forwarded tothe other institutions of the Community and published, with replies fromthese institutions, in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The significance of the Court of Auditors being given the status of a
Community institution under the Maastricht Treaty is that it makes availableto the Court the full range of legal remedies available to other institutions,thus reinforcing the safeguards which ensure that it is able to performeffectively. The Court of Auditor’s task is to assist the European Parliamentand the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementationof the budget. The Court may also submit observations on specific questionsand deliver opinions at the request of one of the European institutions.
The Court of Auditors is required to provide the Council and Parliament
with a Statement of Assurance relating to the reliability of accounts and thelegality of the underlying transactions. In its auditing function, the Court ofAuditors may examine records in the European institutions and the MemberStates. The Court of Auditors examines the accounts of Community revenueand expenditure and considers whether these have been received andincurred in a lawful manner and whether the financial management has beensound. The Court of Auditors is independent and has the power to carry outits audits at any level. In addition to monitoring the internal revenues andexpenditure of the Union, the Court of Auditors also monitors co-operationagreements between the European Union and many developing countries,and the system of Community aid to Central and Eastern Europe.Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Economic and Social Committee
The Economic and Social Committee is appointed by the Council, and
currently has 222 members, appointed on the basis of the populations ofMember States.
81The Member States submit lists of nominees for
appointment, and are required to nominate twice as many persons as will beappointed (Article 259 of the EC Treaty). Members of the Committee arerepresentative of different occupational and social groups. Article 257 of theEC Treaty stipulates that the Committee has advisory status. Article 257 alsostipulates that, in particular, the Committee shall have representatives ofproducers, farmers, carriers, workers, dealers, craftsmen, professionaloccupations and representatives of the general public.
The Committee of the Regions
Under the Treaty on European Union 1992, the Committee of the Regions,currently comprising 222 representatives of regional and local bodies, wasestablished, with advisory status (Articles 263–65 of the EC Treaty). Withenlargement, the number of members will increase to 344. It advises theCouncil and Commission on education, culture and regional development.The Committee, headed by a Chairman, meets at the request of the Council orCommission, and may also meet on its own initiative. The Committee must beconsulted by the Council or the Commission where the Treaty so provides.
The European Investment Bank
Established under the Treaty on European Union 1992 (see Articles 266–67 ofthe EC Treaty), the European Investment Bank is charged with the task ofpromoting the ‘balanced and steady development of the common market inthe interest of the Community’. The Bank operates on a non-profit makingbasis, and grants loans and can give guarantees which facilitate the financingof a number of projects, including projects for developing less developedregions, modernising or conversion projects and projects of common interestto several Member States.

Assisting the judges are eight Advocates General,whose duties aredefined in Article 222 of the Treaty as ‘acting with complete impartiality andindependence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases broughtbefore the Court of Justice ...’. It is the Advocates General who will examineeach case and present the legal arguments to the Court for its decision.
Pressure on the ECJ resulted in a Court of First Instance being introduced
under the Single European Act 1986. Starting work in 1989, the Court of FirstInstance consists of 15 Members with the majority of cases being heard inChambers comprising three or five judges. The Court of First Instance is notempowered to hear and determine questions referred for a preliminary rulingunder Article 234 of the EC Treaty, on which see further, Chapter 9.
The role of the ECJ is provided for in the most general terms by Article 220
of the EC Treaty: ‘The Court of Justice shall ensure that in the interpretationand application of this Treaty, the law is observed.’ At first sight, given thatthe jurisdiction of the Court is derived solely from the treaties, Article 220would seem to confine the ECJ to consideration of Community law, a pointreinforced by the wording of Article 234 of the Treaty. In the early days, theCourt adopted this narrow interpretation of its jurisdiction and the Courtrejected any invitation to draw on the law of Member States in the forming ofdecisions. From the 1970s at least, a change in attitude can be discerned in thereasoning of the Court. From that time, judges felt able, indeed compelled, tomake recourse to domestic law of Member States in order to ensure both theeffectiveness of Community law within a particular Member State and toproduce harmony between the laws of all Member States. The Courtaccordingly draws particularly on fundamental concepts existing in the lawsof Member States in order to enable common legal concepts to be incorporatedinto Community law.
83However, the ECJ can only rule on the interpretation
and legality of EC/EU law: it has no power to rule on the domestic laws ofMember States. It is the need for uniformity of the law within the legalsystems of Member States which represents a major function of the Court. 
Under Article 226 of the Treaty, the Court of Justice may make rulings on a
matter brought before it by the Commission alleging breach of the treaties bya Member State. Prior to bringing the matter to the ECJ, the Commissionexercises a quasi-judicial function. The Commission must first consider that aMember State has failed to fulfil a Treaty obligation and, secondly, give areasoned opinion to that state and advise as to the action which must be taken,and the time limit for action to be taken to comply with the opinion. Only if aMember State fails to comply with the opinion will the matter be taken to theChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
26283 See Mendelsen, 1981; Dauses, 1985.

Structure and Institutions
ECJ. In Commission of the European Communities, supported by Kingdom of Spain
and United Kingdom v French Republic (1997),the Court of Justice ruled that
France had failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty (Article 28, in
conjunction with Article 10), in that it had failed to adopt appropriatemeasures to prevent farmers and others from obstructing the free movementof fruit and vegetables. The Court ruled that the free movement of goods wasone of the fundamental principles of the Treaty. The French government hadfailed to prevent violent and obstructive behaviour by farmers and others andtherefore its failure placed it in breach of the Treaty requirements.
In Commission of the European Communities v United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (2000), the Commission sought a declaration that the
United Kingdom had failed fully to comply with a Directive
84concerning the
protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agriculturalsources. The United Kingdom authorities had identified only surface watersintended for extraction of drinking water, whereas the Directive also requiredthe identification of surface freshwaters not intended for the abstraction ofdrinking water which contained excessive nitrate concentrations or could doso. In addition, no ‘vulnerable zones’ had been identified in Northern Ireland,and those areas which had been designated had been designated on theincorrect criteria, as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The fact that theauthorities were now taking action to remedy the failure did not exclude thestate’s liability for breach of its obligations under the Directive.
Two early examples of the circumstances giving rise to the use of this
power are provided in Commission v Italy (1979) and Commission v United
Kingdom (1979). In the latter case, a Regulation issued by the Council came
into effect on 1 January 1976, requiring Member States to introduce
tachographs
85into certain commercial vehicles. In February 1976, the United
Kingdom government sent a draft statutory instrument, which showed theintention to introduce a voluntary rather than compulsory scheme. TheCommission reiterated the compulsory nature of the scheme and, in May1977, the government indicated that it would not comply. In October 1977, theCommission initiated action under Article 169 of the EC Treaty (now Article226). In January 1978, the government stated that, due to trades unionobjections, it was unable to comply. In February 1978, the Commission gaveits reasoned opinion requiring compliance and a two month period in whichto comply. In June 1978, the matter went to the European Court. In February1979, the ECJ ruled that the United Kingdom was in breach of the Treaty.Failure to transpose a Directive into national law by the stipulated date willnot be excused on the basis that transposition required revision of provisionsof a Member State’s constitution. The Court of Justice so held in Commission v
Kingdom of Belgium (1998), in which an action was lodged under Article 169 of
26384 Council Directive 91/676/EC of 12 December 1991.

the EC Treaty for a declaration that Belgium had failed to bring into force
within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrativeprovisions necessary to comply with Council Directive 94/80/EC, which laiddown detailed arrangements for the exercise of the right to vote and to standas a candidate in municipal elections by citizens of the Union residing in aMember State of which they are not nationals. 
Under Article 227 of the Treaty, one Member State may bring a fellow
Member State before the Court. Again, a procedure is specified which givesthe Commission a quasi-judicial function. Before an action is brought beforethe Court the aggrieved Member State must bring the matter to the attentionof the Commission. Once again, the Commission must give a reasonedopinion, the Member State having been given the opportunity to make oraland written submissions on the allegation. Once this procedure has beencompleted, the Member State has a discretion whether or not to bring thematter before the Court. If the Commission fails to act and deliver its opinionwithin three months from the date of the allegation, then the aggrieved statemay proceed with the action before the Court. 
Article 228 of the Treaty provides that, if the ECJ finds that a Member State
has failed to fulfil its obligations, the state shall be required to take thenecessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. However, oneof the principal defects in the ECJ’s power lay in its inability to imposesanctions. 
The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced two significant reforms. In relation
to policies relating to free movement of persons, visas, asylum andimmigration, the Court of Justice is given jurisdiction to make rulings onquestions of interpretation of the relevant Treaty provision and to rule on thevalidity or interpretation of acts of the institutions of the Community. Thisright is confined to courts or tribunals against which there is no judicialremedy, and provides that that tribunal or court must refer the matter for a
ruling. The Court may also give rulings on the interpretation of these matterswhen requested by the Council, Commission or a Member State. The Courtdoes not have jurisdiction, however, to rule on any measure relating to themaintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.
86The
Court’s jurisdiction is also extended in relation to the third pillar (Police andJudicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters, formerly Justice and HomeAffairs), to give preliminary rulings, in respect of which Member States havemade a declaration stating that they accept this jurisdiction. The Court alsohas jurisdiction to rule on any dispute between Member States or between theMember States and the Commission in respect of the third pillar. 
The increasing volume of work undertaken by the Court of Justice and the
Court of First Instance, has led the Court to propose reforms designed to
improve efficiency. The Court had advocated a form of accelerated orChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
26486 EC Treaty, Article 68.

Structure and Institutions
simplified procedure for dealing with cases of a ‘manifestly urgent nature’,
and for dealing with certain cases on the basis of written procedure alone. Inrelation to preliminary rulings (under Article 234, on which see below), whilethe system should remain, the Court has proposed that where an answer to aquestion is apparent from existing case law, it should rule more frequently byway of simple order, and that Member States could set up judicial bodies withresponsibility for dealing with references for preliminary rulings within theirterritorial jurisdiction.
With the future membership of the Union being set to increase, the Court
has expressed concern that the increasing number of judges would ‘cross theinvisible boundary between a collegiate court and a deliberative assembly’, adevelopment which could pose a threat to efficiency and the consistency ofcase law.
Penalties for failure to comply with rulings of the European Court
The Treaty on European Union empowered the Court to impose a lump sumor penalty payment against a Member State which fails to respect thejudgment of the Court.
87 In January 1997, the Commission agreed the
procedures for the imposition of fines on Member States who fail to complywith rulings of the European Court of Justice. Where a Member State is inbreach of Community law, the Commission will apply to the Court for adetermination of the fine. The levels of fines will be relative to the size of theeconomy of the state. 
Article 230 of the EC Treaty provides the ECJ’s jurisdiction to review the
legality of acts adopted ‘jointly by the European Parliament and the Council,of acts of the Council [and] of the Commission ...’. The Court is also givenjurisdiction to rule on complaints brought by Member States, the Council orthe Commission on grounds of ‘lack of competence, infringement of anessential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule oflaw relating to its application, or misuse of powers’. If an action is wellfounded, the Court may declare the act concerned to be void.
88It is by these
means that the ECJ controls the exercise of powers by the institutions of theCommunity.
89
Article 232 of the Treaty provides the means whereby Member States and
institutions of the Community can challenge the Council and Commission onthe basis that they have failed to act as required under the Treaty. The use ofArticle 232 is illustrated by the European Parliament’s attempt to push theCouncil over the implementation of direct elections to Parliament. Article138(3) of the original EC Treaty (now Article 190(4)) stated that the Assembly

shall draw up proposals for direct elections, which it did in 1960. Article
138(3)(2) stated that the Council shall, acting unanimously, lay down theappropriate measures for the elections and make recommendations toMember States for their implementation. The Council failed to act and in 1969the Assembly again requested action, threatening the Council with an actionunder Article 175 (now Article 232) for failure to act. Agreement was finallyreached and direct elections took place in 1979. Article 138 also provided thatthe voting procedure employed within Member States for the election ofMembers of the European Parliament would be ‘uniform’. This measurelapsed in 1979, when it became clear that uniformity would not beachievable.
90 Article 190(4) now simply provides that representatives in the
European Parliament ‘shall be elected by direct universal suffrage’.
Article 234 of the EC Treaty91
The single most important jurisdiction in terms of ensuring that Communitylaw is uniformly interpreted within national legal systems is that conferred onthe Court to give preliminary rulings under Article 234. The Court may ruleon the interpretation of the Treaty, and on the validity and interpretation ofacts of the institutions of the Community. Article 234 provides that:
The Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings
concerning:
(a) the interpretation of this Treaty;(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions of the Community
and of the European Central Bank (ECB);
(c) the interpretation of the statutes of bodies established by an act of the
Council, where those statutes so provide.
Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State
that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question isnecessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court of Justice to give aruling thereon.
Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal
of a Member State against whose decision there is no judicial remedy undernational law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court ofJustice.
It is this Article which raises directly the nature of the legal system of the
Community and the relationship between Community law, the EuropeanCourt of Justice and domestic law and the role of judges in national courts.Article 234 is crucial to the development of Community law and the Treaty ofRome (the EEC Treaty, now the EC Treaty) extended the jurisdiction of theCourt in a significant manner. Under the European Coal and Steel Treaty, theCourt had power to rule on the validity of Community actions when the issuewas in question before the national court – but it did not, unlike the Court ofChapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
26690 Council Decision and Act of 20 September 1976 on Direct Elections.
91 See Arnull, 1988b, 1989 and 1990.

Structure and Institutions
Justice under the EEC Treaty, have jurisdiction to interpret the Treaty. There is
a vast difference in power between being able to rule on the vires of an action
of an institution and the power to interpret the Treaty provisions themselves.
The latter power gives to the Court a dynamic function as opposed to the
more limited review function, which, whilst important, did not entail anydevelopment of substantive law by interpretative methods. Under Article 234,the ECJ has been given a role in the creation of law at least as important as thelegislative powers of the Commission and Council. This power, as utilised, is amatter of some controversy with the European Court, being both criticisedand praised for adopting a deliberate policy making stance which goesbeyond that of interpretation of the Treaty.
92
Article 234 envisages a partnership approach between the domestic courts
and the European Court of Justice. It is important both as a matter of principleand as a practical matter that the domestic courts are actively involved in theapplication of Community law, and that a measure of discretion is left todomestic courts in the matter of referring a matter to the ECJ under Article234. It must also be recognised, however, that the discretion left to domesticcourts carries with it the potential for a distortion of the meaning ofCommunity law within the 15 legal systems. A particular difficulty faces thecourts in the United Kingdom, whose traditional approach to theinterpretation of statutes has been one very much constrained by the detailedwording of statutes and the pedantic literal, golden and mischief rules. Bycontrast, in civil law systems,
93the judges are experienced in interpreting
broadly phrased statutory provisions, using the teleological94interpretative
method. Lord Diplock explained the approach of the European Court in Henn
and Darby v Director of Public Prosecutions (1981) :
The European Court, in contrast to English courts, applies teleological rather
than historical methods to the interpretation of the Treaties and otherCommunity legislation. It seeks to give effect to what it conceives to be thespirit rather than the letter of the Treaties; sometimes, indeed, to an Englishjudge, it may seem to the exclusion of the letter. It views the Community asliving and expanding organisms and the interpretation of the provisions of theTreaties as changing to match their growth. [p 852]
Under Community law, both the common law and civil law systems must
coexist in a manner which best promotes the harmony of the new legal systemcreated by the treaties. For harmony to be achieved, it is axiomatic that judgeswith very differing backgrounds and experience adopt a common approachboth to interpretation and to the circumstances under which it is appropriateand necessary to refer a matter to the European Court of Justice forinterpretation. In order to understand the relationship between the EuropeanCourt of Justice and national courts, and the issue of the supremacy of

93 Defined as those deriving primarily from Roman law.94 That is to say, seeking the interpretation which most closely fits the objective sought by
the legislature.

Community law, it is first necessary to examine the sources of Community
law, and the manner in which Community law comes into effect in domesticlaw. This matter is discussed in the next chapter. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN
CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS
The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and FundamentalFreedoms – drafted and enacted in 1950 under the aegis of the Council ofEurope
95– establishes a charter of rights and freedoms which are protected by
the Commission and Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.96The Treaty of
Rome 1957 (now Article 303 of the EC Treaty) envisaged close links with theCouncil of Europe.
97The EC itself, however, has not as such been bound by
the Convention.98
In 1979 the Commission of the European Community adopted a
Memorandum endorsing the option of accession by the EC to theConvention.
99A number of obstacles lie in the way of such accession. First, it
would enable the rights enshrined in the Convention to enter indirectly intothose dualist states
100which had not incorporated the Convention into
domestic law. Secondly, it would further increase the workload of the alreadystretched Strasbourg machinery. Thirdly, it would pose problems for theenforcement of rights in those states seeking admission to the EuropeanCommunity which do not yet conform to the principle of the rule of law andprotection of rights which underlies membership of the European Communityand Union.
101
The Preamble to the Single European Act 1986 had already made explicit
the concern for the protection of human rights within the Community. ThePreamble stated a:
... determination to promote Democracy on the basis of the Fundamental
Rights recognised in the constitutions of the Member States, in the Conventionfor the Protection of Human Rights and the European Social Charter, notablyfreedom, equality and social justice.
Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union goes further, and states that:Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law
26895 Of which all Member States of the European Community are members.
96 Institutional changes have been effected to unify the Commission and the Court; see,
further, Chapter 19.
97 Article 230 states that ‘The Community shall establish all appropriate forms of co-
operation with the Council of Europe’.

Structure and Institutions
The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedomssigned in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutionaltraditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Communitylaw.
The original Treaties gave no explicit reference to the protection of individual
rights in their entirety, although Treaty articles such as Article 119102provide
for equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment. Themanner in which the ECJ has developed the jurisprudence on rights is linkedinextricably with its insistence on the supremacy of Community law over thedomestic law of Member States. In 1969, the Court of Justice turned itsattention specifically to the status of fundamental individual rights in relationto the principles of Community law. In Stauder v City of Ulm (1969), the ECJ
stated that it had a duty to protect the rights of individuals as provided for bythe constitution of the Member State, and that such provisions formed part ofthe general principles of Community law. Internationale Handelsgesellschaft
mbH v EVST (1970) clarified the relationship between domestic constitutional
law and Community law in matters of rights. The ECJ expressed its opinionthat respect for fundamental rights ‘forms an integral part of the generalprinciples of law protected by the Court of Justice. The protection of suchrights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MemberStates, must be ensured within the framework of the structures and objectivesof the Community’ (p 1134). In Nold v Commission (1974), a case concerning a
person’s status as a wholesaler, the ECJ ruled that, consistent with its earlierjudgment in Handelsgesellschaft, constitutional rights protected under Member
States’ constitutions must be respected, but also declared that ‘internationaltreaties for the protection of human rights’ can ‘supply guidelines whichshould be followed within the framework of Community law’ (para 13). TheEuropean Convention on Human Rights,
103the International Labour
Organisation treaties,104the Council of Europe’s European Social Charter, the
International Covenants on Civil and Political and Economic, Social andCultural Rights
105have all been cited by the ECJ as aids to interpretation of
Community law. 
On a piecemeal, case by case basis, the ECJ has gradually and steadily
incorporated the protection of individual rights into its case law. However,while all Member States of the Community are signatories to the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights (ECHR), the EC is not a party to the ECHR, andthe relationship between the EC and ECHR remains indistinct. The ECJaccepts the significance of the ECHR, and regards the ECHR provisions aspart of the general principles of Community law. However, that position does

not go so far as to amount to the ECHR being regarded as a central, integral
part of Community law. Academics disagree as to whether the ECHR isbinding on the law of the EC. HG Schermers has argued that the EC is boundby the ECHR.
106Conversely, A Dremczewski argues that the ECHR does not
bind the EC.107Whatever the precise status of the ECHR, and its relationship
with the Community, it is clear that the ECJ is committed to the protection ofrights. What remains unclear is the breadth of the protection which the ECJwill afford to provisions of the ECHR. On the question of whether accessionby the Community to the European Convention on Human Rights wascompatible with the Treaty establishing the Community, the European Courtof Justice has itself ruled that there is no legal basis in the Treaty for suchaccession, and that accession could only be brought about by amendment ofthe Treaty.
108
The Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, reiterating the fundamental commitment
of the Union to human rights and fundamental freedoms, introduces thepower to issue penalties to Member States who are in breach of rights. Awareof the potential problems entailed in the enlargement of the Union and theadmission of Member States with a poor record on human rights, the Treatyprovides for a penalty falling short of expulsion from the Union, a penaltywhich itself could undermine the protection of rights of that Member State’scitizens. Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union (formerly Article F.1)provides that:
The Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government
and acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or bythe Commission and after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament,may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a MemberState of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), after inviting the government ofthe Member State in question to submit its observations.
Where such a determination has been made, the Council, acting by a qualified
majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from theapplication of this Treaty to the Member State in question, including the votingrights of the representative of the government of that Member State in theCouncil. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possibleconsequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural andlegal persons.
The principle of respect for human rights is also binding on Member States
when acting within the scope of Community law, namely when implementingan EC measure,
109or seeking to derogate from a fundamental freedom.110Chapter 8: Constitutional and Administrative Law

CHAPTER 9
SOURCES OF COMMUNITY LAW
Having examined the structure, institutions and law making process of the
European Union and Community in the previous chapter, it is now necessaryto turn attention to the forms of Community law and the interaction betweenCommunity law and domestic law. The primary sources of Community laware the Treaties, as amended. Secondary legislation is law made by theCommunity institutions, and includes the interpretation of both primary andsecondary sources by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Secondarylegislation comprises regulations, directives and decisions. Article 249 of theEC Treaty defines these terms as follows:
In order to carry out their task, the Council and Commission shall, in
accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, make regulations, issuedirectives, take decisions, make recommendations or deliver opinions ...
• A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its
entirety and directly applicable in all Member States;
• A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each
Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national
authorities the choice of form or methods;
• A decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is
addressed;
• Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force. 
It is clear from Article 249 that regulations and directive have ‘binding effect’in all Member States, but, as discussed below, this takes different forms.Decisions and recommendations, on the other hand, have more limited effect,the former binding those to whom they are addressed, the latter having ‘nobinding force’. There are, however, other ‘sources’ which, while not havinglegally binding force, nevertheless have a significant impact on the working ofthe Community and Union.
1The institutions of the Union, for example,
formulate their own procedures for self-regulation. In addition, as will be seenbelow, the Council has the power to enter into international agreementsbetween the Community and non-EU states on behalf of the Member States ofthe Union. In addition, there are measures which are labelled ‘soft’ (asopposed to ‘hard’) law. In addition to recommendations and opinions underArticle 249, Jo Shaw (2000) cites ‘communications, conclusions, declarations,action programmes and communiqués’ as examples of soft law. Joint actionstaken by Members States in pursuit of Union objectives also fall within soft
271EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW 
AND NATIONAL LAW

law, as do conventions and ‘framework decisions’ made in relation to policy.
While the principal concern in this chapter is with the ‘hard law’ of theCommunity and Union, it must also be recognised that these disparatemechanisms exist in order to further European objectives across wide rangingfields of policy on which it may not be possible always to secure completeagreement between all 15 Member States, and therefore translate a soft lawmeasure into hard law which has binding legal effect.
DIRECT APPLICABILITY AND DIRECT EFFECT2
The principles of direct applicability and direct effect3
As can be seen from the text of Article 249, a regulation is ‘binding in its
entirety’ and has direct applicability. By ‘direct applicability’ it is meant thatthe measure leaves no discretion to the Member States but, rather, confersrights and duties within the Member States without further legislativeparticipation. In other words, the provision is self-executing. On the otherhand, a directive, whilst binding in its objective, leaves to the Member Statesome leeway in its introduction and the manner in which a Member Stateimplements and achieves the objectives set by the Council, Commission andEuropean Parliament.
In order to understand the way in which Community law operates within
Member States’ legal systems, the principle of direct effect must be examined.
The basic principle of direct effect of Community measures is that nationals ofMember States may invoke certain provisions as conferring direct rights,which individuals may rely in national courts. While Article 249 statesspecifically that regulations are directly applicable, the Article is silent as tothe legal consequence of this applicability, and as to whether a Treaty provision
itself, or regulations or directives, can have direct legal effect on individuals.
4
The principle of direct effect is linked to Article 10 of the EC Treaty which
provides, in part, that:
Member States shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or
particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Treaty orresulting from action taken by institutions of the Community. They shallfacilitate the achievement of Community tasks. They shall abstain from anymeasure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of thisTreaty.

3 The two terms are used synonymously by the Court of Justice of the European
Communities. See Winter, 1972; Eleftheriadis, 1996.
4 See Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v Asda Food Stores Ltd (1999), in which the Court of
Appeal ruled that a regulation did not have direct effect, inter alia , since it was not
sufficiently clear and precise and itself indicated that it was not intended to have direct
effect.
5 See Temple-Lang, 1990.

European Community Law and National Law
As can be seen from Article 10, Member States are under a legal duty both to
take action to ensure compliance with Community law and to refrain fromany action which might impede the application and effectiveness ofCommunity law. Article 10 forms the basis for much of the jurisprudence ofthe ECJ, and the foundation for the enforcement of individual rights againstMember States.
Direct effect and Articles of the Treaty
In 1963, the ECJ articulated the theoretical basis for the principle of directeffect in Van Gend en Loos (1963), a case which involved a reference to the ECJ
from the Dutch courts. From this case, many significant later developments ofCommunity law can be seen to originate. Under Article 25 of the EC Treaty(formerly Article 12):
Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect
shall be prohibited between Member States. This prohibition shall also apply tocustoms duties of a fiscal nature.
Before 1958, and the coming into force of the EC Treaty, the Dutch firm of Van
Gend en Loos had been importing glue from Germany, applying a customsduty of three per cent. In 1959, the Dutch government ratified an agreementwith other countries establishing an eight per cent duty. The companyprotested to the Customs Court, relying on the direct effect of Article 12 of theEC Treaty. The Court referred the matter to the ECJ under Article 177 (nowArticle 234). The principal question for the court was whether, as claimed,Article 12 had direct effect on the legal position on the company. The TreatyArticle did not stipulate its legal effect, and Article 189 of the EC Treaty (nowArticle 249) refers only to regulations having direct applicability. The ECJ heldfirst that, if a Treaty provision is to confer individual enforceable rights, itmust indicate that it applies not just to Member States but also to individualswithin the state. Secondly, the provision must be clear and precise. Thirdly,the provision must be unconditional and unqualified and not subject to anyfurther measures on the part of Member States. Finally, the provision must beone which does not leave any substantial latitude or discretion to MemberStates.
Specifically in relation to Article 12, as it then was, the ECJ held that the
text was clear and unconditional, that it required no legislative intervention bythe Member State and that the Member State had no power to subordinateArticle 12 to its own law. Thus, it can be seen that both provisions in theTreaty and regulations are capable of having direct effect if they satisfy therequirements laid down by the ECJ.
The principle of direct effect of Treaty provisions was examined by the
House of Lords and the ECJ in Henn and Darby v the Director of Public
Prosecutions (1979–81). In that case, the accused defended a criminal
prosecution on the basis that the subject matter of the charge offended against
273

Treaty provisions. The accused were charged with conspiracy to import
obscene materials contrary to the law of the United Kingdom. Article 28 of theEC Treaty (formerly Article 30), however, prohibits quantitative restrictionson imports. The House of Lords referred the matter to the ECJ under Article177 (now Article 234), asking the ECJ to interpret Article 30 (now Article 28) inorder to establish whether English law was bound by the restriction in Article30. In response, the ECJ ruled that English law infringed Article 30 but thatlawful restrictions on pornography could be imposed by a Member Stateunder Article 36 of the EC Treaty (now Article 30), which provides thatrestrictions on imports otherwise contrary to Article 30 are justified on thegrounds of, inter alia, public morality, public policy or public security.
Accordingly, the prosecution was able to proceed, but the point wasestablished that the defendants could raise the direct effect of Article 30 intheir defence.

A further question which arises is whether directives are similarly capable ofhaving direct effect. It has been seen from Article 249 that directives leave nodiscretion as to their objectives, but do leave some discretion as to manner ofimplementation. Nevertheless, the ECJ has found provisions of directives tobe capable of having direct effect. The reasoning of the ECJ is revealed in Van
Duyn v Home Office (1975). Article 39 of the EC Treaty (formerly Article 48)
provides (in part) that:
1 Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the
Community.
2 Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination
based on nationality ... as regards employment, remuneration, conditions
of work and employment.
3 It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public
policy, public security and public health to accept offers of employment ...
Yvonne Van Duyn, a Dutch national, arrived in England in May 1973, having
accepted a job as a secretary with the Church of Scientology. ImmigrationOfficials refused Ms Van Duyn admission to the United Kingdom on the basisthat the Secretary of State considered employment with the Churchundesirable. In an action against the Home Office, Ms Van Duyn sought torely on Article 48 of the EC Treaty and a reference was made to the ECJ underArticle 177 (now Article 234 of the EC Treaty).
The directive in question was that of the Council
8which set out the
objective of co-ordinating measures concerning movement and residence. The
public policy issue, relied on by the Home Office, was regulated by ArticleChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
2746 See, also, Erich Ciola v Land Vorarlberg (1999).
7 See Craig, 1997.
8 64/221/EEC, Article 3.

European Community Law and National Law
3(1) of Directive 64/221, which stipulates that: ‘... measures taken on grounds
of public policy and public security shall be based exclusively on the personalconduct of the individual concerned.’ 
The ECJ held that it would be incompatible with the binding effect
attributed to a directive to exclude in principle – as the United Kingdomgovernment sought to argue – the possibility that the obligation which itimposed might be invoked by those concerned: that the Directive’s usefulnesswould be weakened if an individual could not rely on it before nationalcourts. Since the directive laid down an obligation which was not subject toany exception or condition, and by its nature did not require intervention onthe part of the Community or Member States, it followed that the directivewas to be regarded as directly effective and conferred enforceable individualrights which national courts must protect.
Thus, it can be seen that, in some cases, directives, as well as regulations
and Treaty provisions, may have direct effect – depending on their wordingand clarity and whether or not Member State action is required as aprerequisite to implementation. The deadline for implementation of theDirective must, however, have passed.
9Where a directive is not precise, and a
right insufficiently defined, it will not have direct effect. The Court of Appealso ruled in Gibson v East Riding of Yorkshire Council (2000). At issue was Article
7 of the Working Time Directive, which requires Member States to takenecessary measures to ensure that workers are entitled to ‘paid annual leaveof at least four weeks’ in accordance with relevant national legislation.Mummery LJ stated that the right that the applicant wished to assert againstthe council was quite simply not sufficiently defined in Article 7 to beenforceable by an individual in national courts and tribunals. Compare,however, the approach taken by the ECJ in Francovich (1991), where the fact
that an amount payable was determinable was enough – in principle – to bedirectly effective, even if the Member State had a discretion to award a greateramount.
Vertical and horizontal effect of Community law
In addition to the concept of direct effect, Community law utilises the notionof vertical and horizontal effect of legal provisions, and this complicatingfactor is one which is the subject of a good deal of argument. In essence, theconcept of vertical effect means that a Community measure – whether aregulation or directive (depending on whether the qualifying criteria are met)– is directly enforceable by an individual against the Member State. In otherwords, the rights conferred and obligations imposed by Community law areenforceable at the suit of an individual against his or her own Member State,which is responsible for giving effect to the Community provision. Forexample, in Van Duyn v The Home Office (above), the citizen was challenging
the decision of a government minister: the action was thus vertical in nature
2759 See Pubblico Ministero v Ratti (1979).

and the Directive could be invoked. Of greater difficulty is the question of
whether an enforceable obligation exists which entitles an individual topursue his or her rights, not directly against the Member State, buthorizontally against institutions, organisations or individuals within theMember State other than the government of the state. The form of direct effect– that is to say, vertical or horizontal – will determine the liable bodyconcerned.
With vertical effect, Community law imposes a duty on the Member State
to comply and confers an enforceable right on the citizen. The Member State is
thus responsible to the citizen for the enforcement of his or her Communityrights. Directives enjoy vertical, but not horizontal, effect and can only beinvoked against the state and emanations of the state. The Court of Justicedenies the possibility of horizontal direct effect of directives,
10which would
extend the liability for failure to comply with Community law requirements tonon-state bodies or individuals. However, the concept of indirect effect (onwhich, see below) of directives complicates this theoretically straightforwardposition. Under the concept of indirect effect, the Court of Justice insists thatnational courts have a duty to interpret national law in a manner consistentwith Community law directives so far as possible. This doctrine applies evenin actions between two individuals, and regardless of whether the directive ornational law is earlier in time. Where indirect effect applies, therefore, adirective appears to have been given horizontal effect. 
PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC BODIES
In Defrenne v SABENA (1978) ,the ECJ confirmed the principle of horizontal
direct effect of Treaty provisions. In that case, the provision in question wasArticle 119 of the EC Treaty (now Article 141). Gabrielle Defrenne, an airhostess with the Belgian airline SABENA, was required, under the contract ofemployment, to retire at the age of 40, whereas men did not have to retire atthat age. Moreover, she was paid less than male employees, and wouldreceive a smaller state pension then men. The state pension question went tothe ECJ, which ruled that Article 119 of the EC Treaty did not cover statepension rights.
11Ms Defrenne then commenced actions against her employer,
on the issue of equal pay and on the discriminatory retirement ages. Inrelation to the question of equal pay (but not retirement age), the action wassuccessful.
12The matter was referred to the ECJ, which ruled that Member
States were obliged to implement Article 119 by the end of a transitionalperiod, and that the principle of direct effect of the Article entitled individualsto rely on Article 119, (now Article 141 of the EC Treaty) against both publicChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law

12Defrenne v SABENA (1978).

European Community Law and National Law
and private sector employers, even where the provisions implementing the
principle of equal pay had not been implemented by the state.13
The duty imposed on Member States under Article 10 of the EC Treaty is
clear, and forms the basis for the European Court’s jurisprudence on directeffect. The question of whether a directive could be relied on by individualsagainst employers was tested in the English courts in Marshall v Southampton
and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority (1986). The UK Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 enabled differing retirement ages to be fixed for menand women. Mrs Marshall challenged the legality of the requirement forwomen to retire at the age of 60, alleging that the Act was contrary to theEuropean Community’s Equal Treatment Directive.
14Two issues, therefore,
fell for consideration by the court. First, were different retirements ages inbreach of the EC Directive and, secondly, if so, could an individual rely on theDirective to challenge an Area Health Authority? In other words, the issuewas whether the Directive was directly effective against an employer in itscontractual relationship with an employee or, alternatively, whether the AreaHealth Authority was an ‘emanation of the state’. An Area Health Authoritywas deemed to be a public (as opposed to a private) body, and accordinglybound by Community law. The ECJ made clear that in principle a directivecould not, of itself, create obligations for non-state actors.
In Foster v British Gas plc (1991), however, which also entailed differing
retirement ages for employees, the Court of Appeal had held that British Gas,a statutory corporation, was not a public body against whom the Directivecould be enforced. The House of Lords sought clarification on this issue fromthe ECJ under Article 177 (now Article 234). The ECJ refused to accept BritishGas’s argument that there was a distinction between a nationalisedundertaking and a state agency and ruled that a directive might be relied onagainst organisations or bodies which were ‘subject to the authority or controlof the state or had special powers beyond those which result from the normalrelations between individuals’. The Court accordingly ruled that a directivemight be invoked against ‘a body, whatever its legal form, which has beenmade responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for providing apublic service under the control of the state and has for that purpose specialpowers beyond those which result from the normal rules applicable inrelations between individuals’. Therefore, British Gas was a public bodyagainst which a directive might be enforced, a ruling which the House ofLords subsequently accepted. In Doughty v Rolls Royce plc (1992) ,however, the
Court of Appeal distinguished Foster and held that Rolls Royce plc, although
‘under the control of the state’ had not been ‘made responsible pursuant to ameasure adopted by the state for providing a public service’. Rolls Royce was

women, see Chapter 20.
14 Directive 76/207/EEC.

at the time a nationalised body, responsible for providing defence equipment.
However the court distinguished between services for the public and servicesprovided to the state, and thereby ruled Rolls Royce not to be a public bodyfor the purposes of the effectiveness of directives.
The European Court of Justice, in Faccini Dori v Recreb srl (1994), re-
examined the principle of the horizontal effect of directives. An EC consumerdirective,
15which had not yet been implemented by the Italian authorities,
founded a claim against a private undertaking. The Advocate General arguedthat the ECJ should extend the principle of direct effect of directives to claimsagainst all parties (irrespective of their public or private nature). The ECJdeclined to do this, and reasserted its view that directives could not beinvoked directly against private bodies. However, the ECJ referred to thepossibility that directives could be deemed to be indirectly effective and alsothat they might be enforceable via the principle of the liability of the state togive effect to Community measures, as seen in Francovich and Bonifaci v Italy
(1992) (on which, see below). 
In relation to directives, the Court of Justice has ruled that these can, at
best, have vertical effect against an emanation of the state – as laid down inMarshall v Southampton Area Health Authority (No 1) and subsequently
confirmed, as in Faccini Dori v Recreb srl (1994) – and not horizontal effect. The
role of directives in ensuring the harmonisation and approximation of lawswithin the legal systems of the Member States of the Union, and the manner inwhich direct effect ensures harmonisation is illustrated by the case of CIA
Security International SA v Signalson SA and Securitel SPRL (1996),
16which also
has significant implications on the direct effect of directives. Involved in thiscase was the interpretation of Article 30 of the EC Treaty (free movement ofgoods) and of Directive 83/189/EEC, which came before the European Courtof Justice under a reference under Article 177 (now Article 234 of the ECTreaty).
17
Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 83/189 lay down procedures for the provision
of information in the field of technical standards and regulations. Under theseprovisions, Members States must notify the Commission of all draft technicalregulations, and, except in particularly urgent cases, suspend their adoptionand implementation for specified periods until the requirement of notificationhas been complied with. The provisions are unconditional and sufficientlyprecise in terms of their content to have direct effect and so enable anindividual to rely on them before a national court, which must decline to apply
a national technical regulation which has not been notified in advance inaccordance with the directive. The purpose of making such regulationsinapplicable is in order to ensure the effectiveness of Community control forwhich the directive is made. The Court of Justice ruled that:Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law

17 The reference was made by the Tribunal de Commerce, Commercial Court, Liège.

European Community Law and National Law
It is settled law that, wherever provisions of a directive appear to be, from the
point of view of their content, unconditional and sufficiently precise, they maybe relied on against any national provision which is not in accordance with thedirective. [CIA v Signalson (1996), judgment, para 42]
This decision appears to undermine the clear rule against the horizontal effect
of directives as expressed in Faccini Dori. Where previously an individual who
suffers from the failure of a Member State to implement a directive couldresort to a claim for compensation, the decision in CIA Security enables an
individual to claim in a national court that the directive in question isunenforceable, even in proceedings between private parties.
18
The principle of indirect effect
Whereas the principle of direct effect entails rights which are directlyenforceable against the Member State or an emanation of the state, indirecteffect provides a more subtle mechanism for ensuring compliance withCommunity law. Indirect effect involves the application of the duty imposedon Member States, including courts of law under Article 10 of the EC Treaty,which provides that:
Member States shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or
particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Treaty orresulting from action taken by the institutions of the Community. They shallfacilitate the achievement of the Community’s tasks. They shall refrain fromany measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of thisTreaty.
In securing the uniformity of the application of Community law within
Member States, the European Court of Justice has utilised Article 10 to greateffect. National courts are required to interpret all national law in light ofCommunity law, and that duty exists irrespective of whether a Communitymeasure has direct effect.
InVon Colson v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (1984), Article 5 of the EC Treaty
(now Article 10) and the Equal Treatment Directive 76/207 fell forconsideration by the ECJ (see, also, Harz v Deutsche Tradax GmbH (1984)). As
seen above, Article 10 of the Treaty provides that Member States are under aduty to ‘take all appropriate measures’ to ensure fulfilment of theirCommunity obligations. Ms Von Colson’s application for employment in theprison service was rejected. The rejection was based on gender, and wasjustifiable according to the German court. Under German law, the onlycompensation payable to Ms Von Colson was her travelling expenses. Thequestion arose as to whether such compensation gave effect to therequirements of Article 5, as it then was. On a reference under Article 177(now Article 234), the ECJ examined Article 5 (now Article 10) of EC Treaty.
27918 See Shaw, 2000, p 451.

The ECJ ruled that Article 5 imposed a duty not just on the governments of
Member States, but on all national authorities, including the courts. It istherefore the duty of the domestic courts to interpret national law in such away as to ensure that the obligations imposed by Community law areachieved. The result is that, although a provision is not directly effective, itmay be applied indirectly as law by means of interpretation. 
The question of the relationship between domestic law and subsequently
introduced Community law came before the ECJ in the Marleasing case in
1989. In Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA (1992),
19
the ECJ, on a reference from a Spanish court, had ruled that, whereas adirective cannot of itself impose obligations on private parties, national courtsmust as far as possible interpret national law in order to achieve a resultpursued by a directive, and that this must be done whether the nationalprovisions in question were adopted before or after the directive. InMarleasing, no legislation had been passed to comply with the directive: the
duty was nevertheless on the courts to give effect to the Von Colson principle,
that is to say, the court must interpret domestic law in accordance withCommunity law. This principle enables directives to have horizontal effect ‘bythe back door’. A gap in protection, however, still remained. Where there wasno domestic law on a Community matter and where, as a result, there was nodomestic provision to construe in line with Community law, a problem wouldremain. The Court of Justice reaffirmed the interpretative duty in Centrosteel
Srl v Adipol GmbH (2000), in which the Court stated that it was well settled that
‘in the absence of proper transposition into national law, a directive cannot ofitself impose obligations on individuals’. However, the Court went on to statethat: ‘... when applying national law, whether adopted before or after thedirective, the national court that has to interpret that law must do so, as far aspossible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive so as toachieve the result it has in view ...’ Note, however, that this is linked to thedate on which the implementation period expires. This requirement isdesigned to frustrate the argument that horizontal effect should not be createdon grounds of legal certainty.
20Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
28019 See, also, Criminal Proceedings Against Arcaro (1997); and Perceval-Price v Department of
Economic Development (2000).
20 In Aannemersbedrijf PK Kraaijeveld BV ea v Gedeputeerde Staten van Zuid-Holland (1996)
and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) v Autonome Provinz Bozen (1999) the Court of Justice
considered the question of whether directives could be invoked by individuals in their
national courts in the context of judicial review applications, and accepted that thiscould be the case, without enquiring into their capacity for direct effect. The implicationof this is that directives may have an effect distinct from direct effect, which is labelledthe ‘public law effect’. See Scott, 1998, pp 123, 157.

European Community Law and National Law
The liability of the state
As seen above, Article 10 imposes an obligation on Member States to facilitate
and not to impede the objectives of the Community. Where a Member Statehas failed to undertake its duty, the concept of state liability arises. InFrancovich and Bonifaci v Italy (1991), employees were seeking compensation
against Italy for failure to implement a directive which was designed toguarantee the payment of arrears of wages to employees in the event of theiremployer’s insolvency. The time limit set down by the Community forimplementation of the directive had expired and, as a result, Italy was held tobe in breach of its Community obligations under Article 5 (now Article 10).
21
The ECJ held that, while the directive was not sufficiently clear to be
directly effective against the state, as regards the identity of institutionsresponsible for payments, Italy was under an obligation to implement thedirective under Article 5 of the EC Treaty. Accordingly, since Italy had failedin its obligation, it was under a duty to compensate individuals for damagesuffered as a result of its failure.
22The ECJ laid down three conditions which
applied to the issue of compensation for loss, namely that:
(a) the directive confers individual rights;(b) the content of those rights can be identified on the basis of the provisions
of the directive; and
(c) there is a causal link between the state’s failure and the damage suffered
by individuals affected.
23
Under such conditions, an individual may proceed directly against the state.
Accordingly, the importance of the principle of direct effect diminishes, andliability falls not on the employer – whether public or private – but on thestate, by virtue of its obligations under the Treaty. 
However, many questions remained unanswered. Was the state liable only
for failure to implement the directive? Was the state liable, irrespective ofwhether there was any fault involved on the part of the state? Furthermore,was the state liable for loss incurred prior to the ECJ finding the Member Statein breach of its obligations? What form of compensation is recoverable? Doesit include loss of profits? Is compensation confined to economic loss? 
In Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany (1996)
24and R v
Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Ltd (No 4) (1996) ,the
European Court of Justice ruled on the principles which regulate the grant ofcompensation to bodies suffering damage as a result of Member States’ breach
28121 See Gibson v East Riding of Yorkshire DC (1999).
22 Cf Evans v Motor Insurers Bureau (1999).
23 See, also, Marks & Spencer plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners (No 1) (2000); and R v
Durham County Council ex parte Huddleston (2000).
24 For the development of this case, see R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte
Factortame Ltd (No 1) (1989); (No 2) (1991); (No 3) (1992); (No 5) (1998).

of Community law. Member States are obliged to make good the loss suffered
by individuals when: 
• the national legislature, executive or judiciary is responsible for the breach
of Community law;
• the rule of law breached is intended to confer rights on individuals; 
• the breach must be sufficiently serious, defined as a manifest and grave
disregard of the limits on the Member State’s discretion; and 
• there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and
the damage suffered. 
As to the degree of seriousness of the breach, the considerations to be taken
into account by the court considering the issue of compensation, as stipulatedby the Court of Justice, are:
... the clarity and precision of the rule breached; the measure of discretion left
by that rule ...; whether the infringement and the damage caused wasintentional or involuntary; whether any error of law was excusable orinexcusable; the fact that the position taken by a Community institution mayhave contributed towards the omission, and the adoption or retention ofnational measures or practices contrary to Community law.
On any view, a breach of Community law will clearly be sufficiently serious if
it has persisted despite a judgment finding the infringement in question to beestablished, or a preliminary ruling or settled case law of the court on thematter from which it is clear that the conduct in question constituted aninfringement. [ Ex parte Factortame (No 4) (1996)]
Note that Brasserie and Factortame concerned loss suffered as a result of
breaches of Treaty provisions that are directly effective. In other words, the
scope of state liability is neither limited to the failure to implement directivesnor to the absence of direct effect. Member States must compensateindividuals at a level which is commensurate with the loss or damagesuffered. Further, if damages could be awarded under English law to similarclaims based on domestic law, it is possible to award exemplary damages forthe breach of Community law.
The question of compensation was also considered by the Court of Justice
in R v HM Treasury ex parte British Telecommunications plc (1996). The United
Kingdom had incorrectly transposed a directive into domestic law. TheDivisional Court referred the matter to the Court of Justice which ruled thatcompensation for loss caused was only payable under the circumstances laiddown in Factortame (No 4) (above). In the instant case, no reparation was
payable because the breach was not sufficiently serious. The directive wasimprecisely worded and was reasonably capable of being interpreted in themanner adopted by the United Kingdom.Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
282

European Community Law and National Law
InR v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex parte Hedley Lomas
(Ireland) Ltd (1996), the European Court of Justice ruled that the United
Kingdom had an obligation to pay compensation for damage caused to an
individual by its failure to comply with Community law. The UnitedKingdom authorities decided that they would not issue export licences for theexport of live animals intended for slaughter in Spain, on the basis that Spaindid not comply with the directive on the welfare of animals and that, if theexport licence was granted, the animals would suffer treatment contrary to thedirective. However, the export licence was intended to enable the export to aspecific slaughterhouse in Spain, which complied with Community directiveson animal welfare, and the United Kingdom authorities had no evidence thatit did not so comply. As a result, the United Kingdom was in breach of Article34 of the Treaty (now Article 2a), and its action could not be justified underArticle 36 (now Article 30) (justifications for quantitative restrictions onexports). The breach was sufficiently serious and there was a direct causal linkbetween the breach and the damage sustained by the individuals.
In Dillenkofer and Others v Federal Republic of Germany (1996), the European
Court ruled, once again, that, if a Member State failed to take ‘timeous’(timely) action to implement a Community directive, individuals injured bythat failure were entitled to seek reparation from the Member State. MemberStates had been required to bring a directive
25into effect before 31 December
1992. Germany brought the directive into effect as from July 1994. Travellersadversely affected by this delay sought compensation for their loss. The Courtof Justice held that:
The first question to be answered concerned the conditions under which a state
incurred liability towards individuals where a directive has not beentransposed within the prescribed period.
The crux of that question was whether such a failure was sufficient per se to
afford individuals who had suffered injury a right to reparation, or whether
other conditions had to be taken into account ...
Reciting Francovich and Bonifaci v Italy (1991), Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal
Republic of Germany (1996), R v HM Treasury ex parte British Telecommunications
plc (1996) and R v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex parte Hedley
Lomas (Ireland) Ltd (1996), the Court stated that individuals who had suffered
damage were entitled to compensation where the three conditions set out
above were met. Germany had argued in its defence that the time allowed forfull implementation of the directive was too short. This argument, however,did not succeed and the Court ruled clearly that failure to implement adirective within the specified time period per se constituted a sufficiently
serious breach of Community law.
28325 Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990, Article 9.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NATIONAL COURTS 
AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE: ARTICLE 234 
OF THE EC TREATY (FORMERLY ARTICLE 177)26
Article 234 represents a vital means by which the harmony of laws between
Member States is achieved. The European Court of Justice is insistent boththat Community law has supremacy and that it be uniformly applied withinMember States. And yet, the treaties establish a partnership between thejudges within the national legal systems and the European Court. It is notdifficult to see that the task of uniformity is a difficult one as 15 nation statesadopt and adapt to the requirements of Community law. For optimumeffectiveness, a balance needs to be struck between making references to theECJ where necessary and the domestic courts being able to apply Communitylaw without undue delay or cost. 
The text of Article 234 is set out in Chapter 8 (see p 266) and, from this, it
can be seen that courts or tribunals may refer a question, provided that it is aquestion of Community law – and not national law – which requiresinterpretation, and provided also that a decision of the ECJ is necessary toenable the national court to reach a decision in the case.
27A reference becomes
mandatory when the question of Community law is before a court or tribunalof last resort, that is to say, a court or tribunal from which there is no furtherappeal. This does not always mean the House of Lords: in many cases, theappeal structure will end lower in the hierarchy, or leave to appeal may beneeded and be refused. Accordingly the court of last resort may effectively beat any level in the judicial hierarchy. If no appeal is possible and the othercriteria of a question of Community law and the necessity for interpretationexist, a reference must be made. In Costa v ENEL (1964), the reference was
from a magistrates’ court and involved a claim of less than £2.00 in value: noright of appeal existed because the amount in issue was so small. 
The English Court of Appeal, in Bulmer v Bollinger (1974),considered the
question of when references to the ECJ should be made and Lord Denninglaid down the following guidelines for English courts to apply when areference was a matter of discretion:
(a) the decision must be necessary to enable the court to give judgment – a
court must feel that it cannot reach a decision unless a reference is made;
(b) the decision of the question must be conclusive to the case – not just a
peripheral issue;
(c) even if the court considers a reference to be necessary, regard must still be
paid to:Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law

European Community Law and National Law
• the delay involved;
• the expense;• the difficulty of the point of law;
• the burden on the European Court.
These ‘guidelines’ are questionable in so far as they may impede the
willingness of a court to refer matters to the ECJ, and they represent a gloss onthe wording of Article 234. A further impediment to referral may arise fromthe doctrine of acte clair – the concept which states that if a matter is so
obvious in its meaning to the domestic court, then no reference need be made.As with the Bulmer v Bollinger guidelines, the doctrine of acte clair can lead to
distortions in interpretation within domestic legal systems. The ECJ has itselfconsidered the circumstances under which courts should refer, and thedoctrine of acte clair,
28in the CILFIT case of 1983.29The Court was asked to
consider the meaning of Article 177(3) (now 234(3)) which relates tomandatory references from a court of last resort. The Court ruled that:
(a) there is no duty to refer where a question of Community law was
irrelevant – that is, if the interpretation can have no effect on the outcome
of the case;
(b) there is no duty of refer when the question is one substantially the same as
one previously answered by the ECJ;
30
(c) there is no need to refer where no real doubt about the law exists. The
national court must, however, be satisfied that the matter is equallyobvious to courts of other Member States and to the ECJ. To this limitedextent, the doctrine of acte clair is endorsed.
In CILFIT , the ECJ emphasised that the purpose of Article 177 (now Article
234 of the EC Treaty), in general, was to ensure the proper application anduniform interpretation of Community law in all Member States and to preventdivergencies occurring within Member States.
Whereas national courts have some discretion as to whether to refer a
matter to the ECJ, the position is different in relation to matters of validity – as
opposed to interpretation – of Community law. It is clear that the ECJ has thesole power to rule on whether a measure of Community law is invalid. It isnot for national courts to rule on that question. National courts only have thepower to uphold the validity of Community legislation.
31
The House of Lords had adopted a similar approach to that endorsed by
the ECJ in the CILFIT case, in Henn and Darby v Director of Public Prosecutions in
1981, discussed above. The Court of Appeal had ruled that quantitativerestrictions on imports prohibited by Article 30 did not amount to a total banon such imports, and had refused to refer the case to the ECJ. On appeal to the

30 See Da Costa en Schaake NV (1963).
31 See Foto-Frost v Hauptzollamt Lubeck Ost (1987). See, also, Arnull, 1988a; and Bebr, 1988.

House of Lords, a reference was made to the ECJ, which ruled that a total ban
could be within Article 30 of the EC Treaty (now Article 28). The House ofLords warned that lower courts should be slow to assume that a matter was‘clear’. As Lord Diplock put it:
... judicial minds can differ on questions of interpretation ... this serves as a
timely reminder to English judges not to be too ready to hold that because themeaning of the English text (one of the nine equally authoritative EClanguages) seems plain to them that no question of interpretation can beinvolved.
As seen from the text of Article 234 of the EC Treaty, the questions which may
be referred are:
(a) interpretation of the treaties;
(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of institutions of the Community:
regulations, directives, etc;
(c) the interpretation of statutes of bodies established by acts of the Council.
Once the ECJ accepts jurisdiction – and a discretion is conferred on the ECJ
over whether or not to accept jurisdiction – and gives a ruling, the matter isthen returned to the domestic court for application, thus preserving thepartnership ideal. 
THE QUESTION OF LEGAL SUPREMACY
The question of legal supremacy can be examined both from the standpoint ofthe Community itself and from that of national law.
The European Court of Justice’s view
The ECJ claims that Community law is supreme over national law. This claim
carries the following implications:
(a) Community law confers rights on individuals to which national law must
give effect;
(b) national law cannot prevail over Community law;(c) the effectiveness of Community law must be the same in all Member
States – it cannot vary in effect from one Member State to another;
(d) courts of Member States must follow the interpretation of laws given by
the ECJ or, where there is no authority, and under certain conditions, must
refer the matter to the ECJ under Article 234 of the Treaty;
(e) where the ECJ gives a ruling, Member States are under an obligation to
amend their national laws so as to conform to Community law.
32Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
28632 In January 1997, the Commission agreed the procedures for the imposition of fines on
Member States who fail to comply with rulings of the European Court of Justice. Where
a Member State is in breach of Community law, the Commission will apply to the Courtfor a determination of the fine. The levels of fines will be relative to the size of theeconomy of the state.

European Community Law and National Law
The ECJ has asserted the supremacy which Community law assumes on many
occasions. The early cases lay the foundations for the current relationshipbetween domestic law and Community law. The starting point is once againthe case of Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Tariefcommissie (1963), in which the
ECJ enunciated the view that, by signing the treaties, the Member States hadcreated a new legal order, in which individual states had limited theirsovereign rights. In Costa v ENEL (1964), this view was reaffirmed by the ECJ:
The transfer by the states from their domestic legal system to the Community
legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries withit a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights against which a subsequentunilateral act incompatible with the concept of Community law cannot prevail.
Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v EVST (1970) takes the principle of
Community supremacy further. Under Community law, in order to export
produce, the company was required to obtain a licence, for which a‘permanent deposit’ had to be paid. If the goods were not exported within thelicence period, the deposit was to be forfeited. The company paid the deposit,failed to complete the export, and forfeiture was made. The firm sued theagency involved for return of the deposit, arguing that the forfeiture wascontrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany. TheConstitution provided that powers could be transferred to internationalorganisations, but that no transfer could be made of powers which the centralgovernment itself did not have. Since the retention of the deposit was contraryto the Federal Constitution, it could not, according to German law, be lawfulunder the law of the Community. The matter was referred to the ECJ underArticle 177 (now Article 234). 
The ECJ declared that giving effect to rules or concepts of national law
contained even within the constitution of a state, for the purposes of judging
the validity of Community measures, would have an adverse effect on theuniformity and efficacy of Community law. The validity of Communitymeasures could be judged only in the light of Community law and could notbe affected by allegations that the measures ran counter to fundamental rightsas formulated by the constitution of the Member State. Having made thisunequivocal and controversial statement, the ECJ softened its tone, ruling thatthe respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the ‘generalprinciples of law’ protected by the Court of Justice, and that the protection ofsuch rights, inspired by traditions common to Member States, must be ensuredwithin the framework of the structure and objectives of the Community. 
The Simmenthal case (1976–80) further developed the jurisprudence of the
ECJ in relation to supremacy. Simmenthal imported beef from France intoItaly. Under Italian legislation of 1970, fees for veterinary and health checkshad to be paid by the importer at the frontier. Simmenthal sued the ItalianMinister of Finance for return of the money, arguing that the fee wasequivalent to a customs duty and was contrary to Article 12 (now 25) of theTreaty and Community regulations on the common organisation on beef
287

imports. The national court ordered the Ministry to return the money. The
minister pleaded that the domestic 1970 Act was binding unless and until setaside by the Italian Constitutional Court. 
The Italian court was thus faced with a conflict between Article 12, as it
then was, of the Treaty and a later Italian statute. A reference was made underArticle 177 (now Article 234), the question at issue being whether directlyapplicable regulations issued under Article 189 (now Article 249) requirednational courts to disregard subsequently passed domestic legislation,without waiting for the Constitutional Court to declare it invalid. The ECJheld that regulations take precedence over previous and subsequent domesticlegislation and that a national court, whatever its position or role in thenational judicial hierarchy, must set aside any provision which conflicts withCommunity law and apply Community law in its entirety, without waitinguntil the domestic legislation had been set aside by the Constitutional Court.
The European Road Transport Agreement (ERTA) case ( Commission v Council)
(1971) offers another perspective.
33In 1962, several European states, five of
which were EC Member States, others being Eastern European states, signedthe European Road Transport Agreement, which sought to establish commonrules concerning conditions of work of long distance lorry drivers crossingseveral state boundaries. As such, the Agreement was not an EC agreement.In 1969, the EC had acted for the (then) six Member States by issuing aregulation covering the same issue. In 1970, the matter was furthercomplicated by the Council meeting to attempt to find a common basis for anew transport agreement. The Commission attempted to have theproceedings of the Council annulled on the basis that the Council was notcompetent to reach agreements of this kind.
34
At the heart of the matter lay the question as to who had the power –
Member States, the Council or the Commission – to make such ‘international’agreements. If Member States retained the power to enter into internationalagreements (and such a power is a basic attribute of sovereignty), then theCouncil proceedings were merely recommendatory; if the Council had powerthen the proceedings took on more of a law making character, which deprivedthe Member States of competence to act either unilaterally or collectively. TheCourt held that, having regard to the legal personality of the Community andthe exercise of Community competence in 1969, the sole power to enter intosuch agreements lay with the Community institutions, thus deprivingMember States of any capacity in this regard. The ECJ’s decision had therebyconferred an implied external relations power on the Community. 
Under the EC Treaty, express powers to enter into treaties is provided
under Article 310. It might have been thought that, given such powers, therewould be no need for the ECJ to confirm that the Community has impliedChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
28833 See Mancini and Keeling, 1991.
34 Acting under the EC Treaty, Article 173 (now Article 230).

European Community Law and National Law
powers, as in ERTA. In summary, the effect of these early cases is that, since
1962, the ECJ has declared the existence of a new legal order, one to which
Member States have limited their sovereign rights by transferring these to theCommunity. These rights include even the protection of constitutionallyguaranteed individual rights. Further, it matters not whether a domestic lawin conflict with Community law was passed prior to accession to the EC orsubsequently: neither can prevail over Community law. Thirdly, where theCommunity has the power to act on behalf of Member States in the making ofinternational agreements, Member States have lost that capacity.
It is clear that Community law prevails not only over domestic law, but
also over issues of domestic policy. In R v Secretary of State for the Environment
ex parte Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; the Port of Sheerness Ltd , intervener
(1995), for example, a Council directive
35on the conservation of wild birds fell
for interpretation by the Court of Justice on a reference from the House ofLords under Article 177 of the EC Treaty (now Article 234).
36The questions
referred by the House of Lords were:
(a) whether a Member State was authorised to take account of the economic
requirements mentioned in Article 2 of the Birds Directive when
designating a special protection area and defining its boundaries;
(b) whether a Member State, when designating a special protection area and
defining its boundaries, was allowed to take account of economicrequirements as constituting a general interest superior to that representedby the ecological objectives of the Directive;
(c) whether a Member State could take account of economic requirements to
the extent that they reflected imperative reasons of overriding publicinterest of the kind referred to in Council Directive 92/43/EC on theconservation of the natural habitats of wild fauna and flora.
37
The Court of Justice ruled that the Secretary of State was not entitled to take
economic considerations into account when designating a special protectionarea for wild birds and defining its boundaries. 
Before examining the position of the English courts, it is necessary to
consider the means by which Community law is received into English law.
THE RECEPTION OF COMMUNITY 
LAW INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM
The concepts of monism and dualism
At a conceptual level, the manner in which international law, of whichCommunity law may be regarded as a sui generis (that is to say, unique)
28935 Directive 79/409/EEC (OJ L103pl, 2 April 1979).
36 On the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds’ standing in judicial review
proceedings, see Chapter 24.
37 21 May 1992 (OJ L206, 1992, p 7).

example, is dependent upon whether a particular state adopts a monist or
dualist approach to international law. Monism is the doctrine wherebyinternational law and national law form a single whole, or part of the sameconceptual structure, in which international law takes precedence. Under thisdoctrine, adhered to by, inter alia, France and Italy, the obligations of
international law, once assumed, enter automatically into the legal system,needing no domestic legislative acts. Once entered, the obligations takeprecedence over national law. 
Dualism, on the other hand, regards the systems of international law and
national law as separate: in order for international law to enter into nationallaw, some domestic legislative action must be enacted by the nationalparliament. This is the view adopted by the United Kingdom and is oneconsistent with the sovereignty of parliament; see Chapter 7. Treaties are partof international law, and can have no effect in domestic law unless and until astatute of the sovereign United Kingdom Parliament is enacted to give themeffect. (Note that this matter assumed primary importance in the debate overthe ratification of the Treaty on European Union, the Maastricht Treaty, in1993.)
In 1972, Lord Denning MR confirmed this view in Blackburn v Attorney
General (1971):
Even if a Treaty is signed, it is elementary that these courts take no notice of
treaties as such. We take no notice of treaties until they are embodied in lawsenacted by Parliament, and then only to the extent that Parliament tells us.[p 1382]
Accordingly, the signing of the EC treaties, without any further parliamentary
action, had no effect in English law. In order to have effect, it was necessaryfor parliament to pass the European Communities Act 1972.
The European Communities Act 1972
Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 provides that:
(1) All such rights powers liberties obligations and restrictions from time to
time created or arising by or under the treaties, and all such remedies and
procedures from time to time provided for by or under the treaties ... arewithout further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the UnitedKingdom shall be recognised and available in law and be enforced,allowed and followed accordingly ...
(2) Subject to Schedule 2 of this Act, at any time after its passing Her Majesty
may by Order in Council and any designated Minister or Department mayby regulations make provision:
(a) for the purpose of implementing any Community obligation of the
United Kingdom, or of enabling any rights enjoyed or to be enjoyed by
the United Kingdom under or by virtue of the treaties to be exercised ...
(4) The provisions that may be made under section 2(2) include, subject to
Schedule 2, any such provision (of any such extent) as might be made byChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
290

European Community Law and National Law
Act of Parliament, and any enactment passed or to be passed ... shall be
construed and have effect subject to the foregoing provisions of this section...
Section 3(1) provides that:
For the purposes of all legal proceedings any question as to the meaning andeffect of any of the treaties, or as to the validity, meaning or effect of anyCommunity instrument, shall be treated as a question of law (and if notreferred to the European Court of Justice, be for determination as such inaccordance with the principles laid down by and any relevant decision of theEuropean Court).
Here, then, are the most fundamental provisions of the Act – specifying that
rights and duties which are directly applicable or effective are to be givenlegal effect within the United Kingdom; that the executive has the power togive effect to Community obligations, and that existing and future enactmentsare to be interpreted and have effect and that the meaning or effect of Treatyprovisions is to be decided according to Community law.
The view of the United Kingdom courts
The manner in which, and extent to which, the United Kingdom courts haveaccommodated Community obligations requires consideration. First, it shouldbe noted that nothing in the European Communities Act (ECA) 1972represents an attempt to entrench its provisions, that is to say, to make themimmune from amendment or repeal. There is no statement in the Actpurporting that EC law is a ‘higher form of law’, or that the Act cannot berepealed, or could be repealed but only by some specified ‘manner and form’. 
Nevertheless, section 2(4) has produced controversy among
commentators, given that it directs the courts to interpret Acts of Parliamentpassed in the future in conformity with the principle expressed in section 2(1).The dominant view is that this section does not achieve entrenchment as such,but rather should be viewed as a directive to the courts in the form of a rule ofconstruction (interpretation) which must give way to an express contraryintention expressed by parliament.
Two early challenges were made to the signing of the Treaty on the basis
of the potential or actual loss of parliamentary sovereignty. In Blackburn v
Attorney General in 1971, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the
government, by signing the Treaty of Rome, would surrender part ofparliament’s sovereignty which it could not lawfully do, as no parliamentcould bind another. In R v Home Secretary ex parte McWhirter (1969), the
plaintiff adduced that joining the EC was contrary to the Bill of Rights 1689,which declared that all powers of government are vested in the Crown andparliament could not, therefore, by means of a Treaty, transfer those rights.
In both cases, the arguments were disposed of with speed. In Blackburn,
Lord Denning MR stated that ‘even if the Treaty is signed, it is elementary that
291

the courts take no notice of [it] until embodied in an Act of Parliament’.
Further, in McWhirter , Lord Denning stated that ‘even though the Treaty of
Rome has been signed, it has no effect as far as the courts are concerned untilimplemented by Act of Parliament. Until that day, we take no notice of it’.
A challenge to the government’s Treaty making power also came in R v
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte Rees-Mogg (1994).
Lord Rees-Mogg sought a declaration from the court to the effect that thegovernment could not lawfully ratify the Treaty on European Union 1992, theMaastricht Treaty, without the consent of parliament. The Court of Appealgave short shrift to the argument, relying on the earlier precedents, and noappeal was made to the House of Lords.
Conflicts between Community law and domestic law38
One area of law which has given rise to an instructive array of case lawconcerning the relationship between domestic law and Community law is thatof sex discrimination. There are, of course, a variety of ways in whichdiscrimination on the basis of sex may arise: in relation to equal pay or equaltreatment in respect of access to employment, promotion, training, workingconditions, social security and retirement ages. Article 141 and directives
39
form the framework of the law of the Community. 
In Macarthys v Smith (1981), Mrs Smith was employed by Macarthys as a
stockroom manageress. The man who had previously held the position hadbeen paid a higher wage than Mrs Smith. The applicable domestic legislationwas the Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975,which provided, inter alia , that men and women employed in the same job
should be paid equal amounts. The Act was silent, however, as to whetheremployers were required to pay the same wage to a woman who came to thejob after the man had left their employment. The relevant point forinterpretation, therefore, was whether men and women, employed at differingtimes for the same job, were required to be paid equally.
Article 119 of the EC Treaty (now 141) provides for equal pay for men and
women. This Article is couched in far broader terms than those used by theEqual Pay Act 1970. The matter was referred by the Court of Appeal to theEuropean Court of Justice under Article 177 (now Article 234). The ECJ heldthat Article 119 required equal pay for men and women whether they wereemployed contemporaneously or in succession. On receiving the judgment ofthe ECJ, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Mrs Smith. Lord Denning’sjudgment is of particular significance:
We should, I think, look to see what those [EC] provisions require about equal
pay for men and women. Then we should look at our own legislation on theChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
29238 See, inter alia , Szyszczack, 1990; de Búrca, 1992a and 1992b.
39 75/117, 76/207, 79/7, 86/378, 86/613.

European Community Law and National Law
point – giving it, of course, full faith and credit – assuming that it does fully
comply with the obligations under the Treaty. In construing our statute, we areentitled to look to the Treaty as an aid in its construction: and even more, notonly as an aid, but as an overriding force. If on close investigation it shouldappear that our legislation is deficient – or is inconsistent with Community law– by some oversight of our draftsmen – then it is our bounden duty to givepriority to Community law. Such is the result of section 2(1) and (4) of theEuropean Communities Act 1972.
Thus far, I have assumed that our Parliament, whenever it passes legislation,
intends to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty. If the time should come whenour Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating theTreaty or any provision in it – or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it –and says so in express terms – then I should have thought that it would be theduty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament.
Article 119 fell for further consideration in Garland v British Rail Engineering
Ltdin 1983, this time by the House of Lords. British Rail made concessionary
travel facilities available to the children of male employees reaching
retirement, but not to the children of women reaching retirement. Thequestion was whether this policy amounted to discrimination contrary toArticle 119, as it then was, of the Treaty, and whether the courts in theEngland should construe the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in a manner so as tomake it compatible with the requirements of Article 119. The House of Lordsreferred the matter to the ECJ, which ruled that the policy amounted todiscrimination contrary to Article 119, and that Article 119 must prevail. 
In Duke v GEC Reliance Ltd (1988), the House of Lords considered the
construction of section 6(4) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. In the Duke
case, the plaintiff’s claim for damages based on unequal treatment was for aperiod prior to parliament’s amendment of the Sex Discrimination Act tobring English law into line with the requirements of Community law. TheHouse of Lords declined to give retrospective effect to the amendment in lightof parliament’s express decision not to amend the Act retrospectively. Oneinterpretation of Duke is that, being a pre- Marleasing case – which makes it
clear that the Article 5 duty is imposed on national courts – the House ofLords was in line with the ECJ’s interpretation of the Community law at thetime. 
In Litster v Forth Dry Dock Ltd (1990), however, the House of Lords
interpreted a domestic regulation contrary to its clear meaning in order tocomply with a directive as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The domesticregulation had been introduced for the purpose of complying with thedirective and, accordingly, the House of Lords was complying with its dutyunder section 2(4) of the European Communities Act 1972 to give effect toCommunity law.
40Thus, from the House of Lords’ perspective, one important
29340 See, further, below on the 1972 Act. See, also, Finnegan v Clowney Youth Training
Programme Ltd (1990).

factor in the matter of the interpretation and application of Community law is
the response which parliament has made to the Community measure. Ifparliament had implemented a measure before a directive was made, or ifparliament has responded to the requirements of Community law by notamending domestic law in line with Community law, the judges may holdthat domestic law prevails over Community law. Where, however, parliamenthas responded by amending the law, with the intention of bringing Englishlaw into line with Community law, the English courts would undoubtedlygive effect to the Community law, even where the wording of a domesticregulation required imaginative interpretation to give primacy to Communitylaw.
41
For example, in Pickstone v Freemans plc (1989), the applicants were female
warehouse workers – operatives – who were paid the same as male operativesbut claimed that their work was of equal value to that of warehouse checkers,who were paid more than they were. The Equal Pay Act 1970 did notencompass the concept of equal value, but had been amended in 1983, bystatutory instrument under section 2(2) of the ECA 1972, following a ruling bythe ECJ that the Equal Pay Act was in breach of a Community directive. The1983 amendment was intended to bring the Equal Pay Act protection in linewith Article 119 and the Community directive, but had been obscurelyworded. The result was that the House of Lords was forced to strain toachieve an interpretation which could give effect to what Lord Oliverdescribed as the ‘compulsive provision of section 2(4)’ of the ECA 1972. Therequired result was achieved by the House of Lords departing from the strictliteral interpretation of the text and implying words to fill the legislative gapin order to reach conformity with Community law.
In Webb v EMO Cargo (UK) Ltd (1992) ,the issue of dismissal on the basis of
pregnancy was considered in relation to the EC’s Directive on EqualTreatment. See, further, Chapter 20. The English Trades Union Reform andEmployment Rights Act 1993 provides that dismissal on the grounds ofpregnancy is unfair.
42However, in Webb v EMO Cargo (UK) Ltd (1992), the
Court of Appeal ruled, and the House of Lords affirmed, that a woman whowas dismissed from employment because of her pregnancy was notunlawfully dismissed, since – comparing her to a man with a temporaryphysical disability who would also have been unable to work – the manwould also have been dismissed. Under Article 177 (now Article 234), areference was made to the European Court of Justice. The ECJ ruled thatEnglish law was inadequate and held, first, that pregnancy was not apathological condition to be compared with illness and, secondly, that apregnant woman’s inability to work was temporary and not permanent.Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
29441 As in Litster v Forth Dry Dock and Engineering Company Ltd (1989).
42 Trades Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993, ss 23–25 and Scheds 2 and 3;
EC Pregnancy Directive 92/85.

European Community Law and National Law
Accordingly, the dismissal had amounted to sex discrimination.43The Court
ruled that the Article ‘precludes dismissal of an employee who is recruited for
an unlimited term with a view, initially, to replacing another employee duringthe latter’s maternity leave and who cannot do so, because, shortly afterrecruitment, she is herself found to be pregnant’. The House of Lords, in Webb
v EMO Air Cargo (UK) Ltd (No 2) (1995) ruled that sections 1(1)(a) and 5(3) of
the 1975 Act were to be construed in accordance with the ECJ’s ruling and thatin the case where a woman was engaged for an indefinite period, the fact thatthe reason why she would be temporarily unavailable for work at a timewhen her services would be particularly required was pregnancy was acircumstance relevant to her case, being a circumstance that could not bepresent in the case of the hypothetical man.
44
In Grant v South West Trains Ltd (1998), the Court of Justice apparently
reached the limits of its respect for equality. A Southampton industrialtribunal had referred a question under Article 234 of the Treaty concerningwhether the female partner of a lesbian woman was entitled to the sameemployment benefits enjoyed by married or cohabiting heterosexual couples.The applicant had enjoyed a stable relationship for over two years. When sheapplied for the same benefits as heterosexual couples enjoy for her partner,she was refused on the basis that concessions were only granted to cohabitingcouples who were heterosexual. The Court of Justice ruled that there had beenno violation of the Treaty on the basis of sexual inequality. 
Undoubtedly, the most constitutionally significant British case revealing
the relationship between Community law and domestic law is that of R v
Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame (1991). In 1970, the Council of
Ministers passed a regulation relating to the common organisation of themarket in fishery products. The basic principle employed was that, subject tocertain exceptions, there should be equal access for the fishing vessels of allMember States to the fishing grounds of fellow Member States. In 1983, due tofears of over-fishing caused by such open access, the Council established, byway of regulation, a system for the conservation and management ofresources. This entailed, in part, setting limits to the amount of fish to becaught in certain periods by way of ‘total allowable catches’ – the allocation oftotal allowable catches being fairly distributed among the Member States byway of national quotas. The quotas were based on the number of ships flyingthe flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State.
29543Dekker v VJV Centrum (1991).
44 In Strathclyde Regional Council and Others v Wallace and Others (1998), the House of Lords
ruled that an objectively justifiable employment practice which was not ‘tainted’ by
sexual discrimination, which resulted in unequal pay, did not contravene the Equal PayAct 1970, relying on Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz (1987), EC Treaty, Article
119 (now Article 141). In a significant ruling by a tribunal on equal pay in March 1998, aformer female teacher at an independent school, Eileen Halloran, in an action broughtby the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, was found to have been discriminatedagainst in receiving less pay than male teachers.

Spain acceded to the EC in 1986. Before 1986, the extent to which Spanish
vessels could ship in British waters was determined under agreements
between the Spanish and United Kingdom governments. Under English law,the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 prohibited non-British nationals from owningBritish fishing vessels but did permit corporate ownership by Britishcompanies. Thus, directors/shareholders of Spanish vessels were able toregister under the 1894 Act. Some 96 Spanish fishing boats were registeredunder the Act, and each of these vessels counted as part of the UnitedKingdom’s quota under Community law.
The United Kingdom government, understandably alarmed at the
restrictions imposed on the domestic fishing industry and the ability offoreign companies to register and therefore take up part of the UnitedKingdom’s quota, imposed additional conditions for registration which cameinto force in 1986. The three principal conditions for registration were to bethat a proportion of the catch was to be sold in the United Kingdom; that 75per cent of the crews were to be EC nationals ordinarily resident in the UnitedKingdom; and that all crew were to be required to contribute to the NationalInsurance Scheme.
In 1988, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the Merchant Shipping
Act and enacted fresh merchant shipping regulations. The new system ofregistration
45entailed qualification on the basis of a ‘genuine and substantial
connection with the United Kingdom’. The revised conditions required thatnot less than 75 per cent of vessels be owned by United Kingdom citizensresident in the United Kingdom; or wholly owned in the United Kingdom,with 75 per cent of shareholders and directors in the United Kingdom; or partowned, with 75 per cent of owners in the United Kingdom; and, further, thatvessels be effectively operated from the United Kingdom. Registration wouldbe lost with effect from 31 March 1989 until vessel owners could satisfy thegovernment that they were eligible for registration. 
As a result, Factortame, which did not comply with these more stringent
requirements, challenged the domestic requirements as incompatible with EClaw, on the grounds of discrimination on the grounds of nationality contraryto Article 14 of the Treaty and the rights of companies to establishment underArticles 43–48. The Divisional Court wanted to refer the matter to the ECJunder Article 177 (now Article 234) – a move opposed by the plaintiffs unlessthe Divisional Court was prepared to grant an interim order protecting theirputative Community rights by way of an injunction restraining thegovernment from imposing the requirements of the new regulations. TheDivisional Court, in 1990, granted an interim injunction against thegovernment restraining it from applying the Merchant Shipping Actregulations until final judgment was made following a reference to the ECJunder Article 177.Chapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
29645 SI 1988/1926.

European Community Law and National Law
The government appealed to the Court of Appeal, which ruled that the
court had no jurisdiction to grant interim relief disapplying an Act of
Parliament. On appeal to the House of Lords, the decision of the Court ofAppeal was upheld: injunctive relief against the Crown was not within thecourt’s jurisdiction.
Lord Bridge of Harwich stated that:
In this situation, the difficulty which faces the applicants is that the
presumption that an Act of Parliament is compatible with Community lawunless and until declared incompatible must be at least as strong as thepresumption that delegated legislation is valid until declared invalid. ... if theapplicants fail to establish their claim before the European Court of Justice, theeffect of interim relief granted would be to have conferred upon them rightsdirectly contrary to Parliament’s will ... I am clearly of the opinion that, as amatter of English law, the court has no power to make an order which hasthese consequences.
It has been seen previously that Community law is supreme and requires the
protection – by domestic courts – of Community rights and that English courtscannot rely on parliamentary sovereignty to justify the denial of protectionunless there is a clear and unequivocal parliamentary intention to defeatCommunity law.
46Three complicating and constitutionally significant factors
arose in Factortame. First, whether the court could protect alleged rather than
established rights under Community law; secondly, whether – contrary to allprevious precedent – the provisions of Community law could conferjurisdiction on the English courts to grant injunctive relief against the Crown;and, thirdly, the conditions under which, should such jurisdiction exist, suchrelief could be granted.
The ECJ, in its preliminary ruling on the first point (Case 213/89), held
that the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act should besuspended, pending a full determination of Factortame’s claim, stating that:
The full effectiveness of Community law would be impaired if a rule of
national law could prevent a court seized of a dispute governed byCommunity law from granting interim relief in order to ensure the fulleffectiveness of the judicial decision to be given on the existence of rightsclaimed under Community law.
The ECJ reverted to its decision in Simmenthal (1979), reiterating that directly
applicable rules were to be fully and uniformly applied in all Member States
in accordance with the principle of precedence of Community law overnational law. Article 5 of the EC Treaty (now Article 10 of the EC Treaty)imposes an obligation, as has been seen above, to ensure the legal protectionwhich is provided for under the principle of direct effect. The House of Lordsin R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Ltd (No 2) accepted the
ECJ’s ruling and granted interim relief.
29746 See Macarthys v Smith (1979); Garland v British Rail Engineering (1983).

While legal action being pursued by Factortame was in progress, a
separate action was commenced by the Commission, alleging that the United
Kingdom was in breach of its Treaty obligation, and seeking an order that theUnited Kingdom should suspend the Merchant Shipping Act in respect offishing vessels.
47The ECJ held that an interim order could be granted, on the
basis that the Act could be in breach of the prohibition against discriminationon the grounds of nationality under Articles 43 and 294.

case), the applicant sought an interim injunction which would have had theeffect – as in Factortame – of causing national legislation to be disapplied while
the substantive issue was being considered by the ECJ. In Factortame, great
weight was attached to the very strong prima facie case put forward by the
applicants. In the BTcase, the Court of Appeal cautioned against over-reliance
on the likelihood of success in the ECJ as a basis for granting relief. In part,this caution was based on the fact that a reference had been made to the ECJunder Article 177 (now Article 234), and that to give great weight to theprognosis for success was to pre-judge the interpretation to be given by theECJ. The fact that a reference had been made meant that the English court wasuncertain as to the question in issue. Accordingly it would be inappropriate toprejudge the issue by granting relief at an interim stage. The Court of Appealalso warned of the difficulties in disapplying domestic legislation. As thecourt stated, there should be a distinction drawn between a ‘major piece ofprimary legislation’ and a ‘minor piece of subordinate legislation’. In relationto the former, the court ruled that it would be far more circumspect than inrelation to secondary legislation. In the instant case, unlike Factortame , the
issues were not clear-cut. The court, ruling that it would only grant an interimorder ‘in the most compelling circumstances’, declined to grant theinjunction.
49
The question of the compatibility of domestic law with Community law
arose once more in the case of R v Secretary of State for Employment ex parte
Equal Opportunities Commission and Another (1995) (the EOC case). There, the
Equal Opportunities Commission had brought an action challenging allegedlyChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law
29847Re Nationality of Fishermen: EC Commission (Spain intervening) v United Kingdom (Ireland
intervening) (1991).
48 In R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Ltd and Others (No 5) (1999), the
House of Lords ruled that the United Kingdom’s breach of Community law wassufficiently serious as to warrant damages. For contrasting interpretations of theFactortame case, see Craig, 1991; Wade, 1996; Allan, 1997, and see Chapter 8.
49 In a challenge to a directive, a company sought to restrain the United Kingdom
government from laying before parliament regulations to implement a CouncilDirective. Proceedings were already before the Court of Justice which was not expectedto give judgment until some four months after the time limit for implementation byMember States. The Court of Appeal declined to interfere, stating that interim reliefcould only be given in cases where there would be irreparable damage and that, in anycase, the UK government should not be constrained from making regulations: R v
Secretary of State for Health ex parte Imperial Tobacco Ltd (2000).

European Community Law and National Law
discriminatory employment protection provisions in English law, arguing that
these contravened European Community legislation. The House of Lords, in abold decision, granted a declaration to the effect that national law wasincompatible with Community law. However, the House of Lords did not goso far as to rule that the English provisions were void, rather, the Houseconfined its ruling to the compatibility issue – thus avoiding any potentialconflict with parliament and the concept of sovereignty.
In Ratcliffe and Others v North Yorkshire County Council (1995), the House of
Lords ruled that the County Council had violated section 1 of the Equal PayAct 1970. The action had been brought by Unison, the public service union, onbehalf of 1,300 dinner ladies employed by the Council, whose pay had beenreduced from £3.31 per hour to £3.00 per hour, a rate below that of dustmen,gardeners, cleaners and street sweepers, with whom they had been comparedfor equal pay purposes. Section 1 of the Equal Pay Act 1970
50provides that:
‘An equality clause shall not operate in relation to a variation between thewomen’s contract and the man’s contract if the employer proves that thevariation is genuinely due to a material factor which is not the difference ofsex ...’ Under the Local Government Act 1988, local councils were obliged toput the provision of school meals out to tender, and could only lawfullycontinue to provide such services if their own tender was accepted. In order torender its bid competitive, the Council had made a number of womenredundant and re-employed them at lower hourly rates of pay. The House ofLords ruled that the Council ‘had paid women less than men engaged onwork rated as equivalent’. There was no material difference between the caseof the women and that of their male comparators and, accordingly, theCouncil had discriminated against the women.
The Equal Opportunities Commission welcomed the decision, pointing
out that women still received wages which on average were only 79 per centof those earned by men, and that any clarification which would eliminateinequalities was a step forward. 
In a significant case for part time women workers, the European Court of
Justice, in Magorrian and Another v Eastern Health and Social Services Board and
Another (1998), ruled that national provisions which limited access to
occupational pensions for part time workers amounted to indirect sexualdiscrimination and were contrary to the Treaty. The Occupational PensionSchemes (Equal Access to Membership) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1976violated the right to equality enshrined in Article 141, in specifying limitedrights to membership of pension schemes.

In Marschall v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (1997) ,the Court of Justice ruled
that the equal treatment directives of the Community were not breached

where a national rule allowed female candidates for promotion to be favoured
over equally qualified male applicants, where women were under-represented in a particular field of employment, provided certain conditionswere met. The purpose of the national legislation was to correct the imbalancein employment opportunities, which discriminated against women. The goalwas accordingly to achieve greater gender based equality, not to discriminateagainst men.
52
In 1994 and 1995, public concern over animal welfare in the export of live
animals to Europe for slaughter on the point of destination led to incidents ofpublic disorder and the disruption of exports of animals. In April 1995, theChief Constable of Sussex decided that no policing would be provided toprotect the transport of livestock to the port of Shoreham other than on twoconsecutive days a week or four consecutive days per fortnight, excludingFridays, weekends or bank holidays. The Chief Constable later resolved not tochange the earlier decision or to delay its implementation. InternationalTraders’ Ferry Ltd challenged the decision in an application for judicialreview. 
InR v Chief Constable of Sussex ex parte International Traders’ Ferry Ltd (1995),
the Court of Appeal ruled that the Chief Constable’s restrictions on policingcould be justified under Article 36 of the EC Treaty (now 30), and wereproportionate. The export of live animals from the United Kingdom wasconsidered by the Court of Justice on a reference to the Court by the HighCourt in R v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex parte Compassion in
World Farming Ltd (1998). The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (RSPCA) and Compassion in World Farming Ltd (CIWF) had askedthe minister to prohibit the export of veal calves for rearing in veal crates.They contended that the Government had power under Community law torestrict exports to other Member States where the system of rearing calves wascontrary to the standards in force in the United Kingdom
53and the
international standards laid down by the European Convention for theProtection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes, to which all the MemberStates and the Community had agreed to adhere. Council Directive91/629/EC laid down minimum standards for the protection of calves, whichwere lower than the standards laid down by the Convention. CIWF acceptedthat a ban or restriction on the export of live calves would constitute aquantitative restriction on exports contrary to Article 34 of the Treaty, butnevertheless maintained that such a restriction would be justified havingregard to Article 36 ( inter alia, restrictions justified on the grounds of publicChapter 9: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Court ruled that a Member State cannot rely on Article 36 in order to justifyrestrictions where the Commission has adopted harmonised rules to regulatethe area. Directive 91/62a/EC laid down standards and, even though thesewere less stringent than the national provisions, the Directive overrode thenational requirements. 
CONCLUSION
As the discussion of the aims, development and structure of the EuropeanUnion and Community in Chapter 8 demonstrates, the original aims of theCommunity established under the Treaty of Rome have been expanded anddeveloped into an ambitious, expansive and vigorous Union and Community,founded on the principles of individual rights and the rule of law. Europeanintegration has extended from the limited goals of a common market toincorporate full economic and monetary union and towards ever closer co-operation in relation to matters concerning common defence and securitypolicies and matters relating to co-operation in police and judicial matters. Asthe aims and objectives of the Union have expanded, so too has the law of theCommunity. The European Court of Justice, through its dynamic approach,has ensured the supremacy of Community law over domestic law, to theextent that the Court of Justice’s early statement that the Communityrepresents a ‘unique legal order’ is now a reality which touches onincreasingly wide aspects of domestic law.

PART IV
CENTRAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT



CHAPTER 10
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the structure and roles of the institutions of central
government – the Crown, Privy Council, Prime Minister, Cabinet, ministersand government departments – are examined. In Chapter 11, the concept ofresponsible government is introduced, and the fundamentally importantconcept of ministerial responsibility is considered. If government is to beconducted under the law, and in line with the principles of democracy andconstitutionalism, it is of the utmost importance that those holding powershould be accountable to citizens through their elected legislature. Theresponsibility of ministers of the Crown is thus fundamental to theconstitution, and the more so in the absence of an authoritative constitutionaldocument which defines the scope and limits of ministerial power. Note thatthe procedural means by which parliament scrutinises government action isconsidered in Chapter 16. 
THE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT
THE CROWN
It is commonly hidden like a mystery, and sometimes paraded like a pageant,
but in neither case is it contentious. The nation is divided into parties, but theCrown is of no party. Its apparent separation from business is that whichremoves it both from enmities and from desecration, which preserves itsmystery, which enables it to combine the affection of conflicting parties – to bea visible symbol of unity to those still so imperfectly educated as to need asymbol.
1
While the Monarch is titular head of the government and all governmental
acts are carried out in the name of the Crown, the role of the Queen is largely,but not completely, formal and ceremonial. In the study of the government itis necessary to bear in mind that the United Kingdom remains a constitutionalmonarchy and that the Crown is the symbolic head of the executive,legislature and judiciary. The remaining prerogatives of the Crown have beendiscussed in Chapter 6, which should be referred to for discussion of theCrown’s role in the appointment of the Prime Minister and the dissolution ofparliament. 
305CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

Succession to the Crown
The Act of Settlement 1700 provides that succession to the throne is confined
to members of the Protestant religion and specifically excludes RomanCatholics, or those married to Roman Catholics, from succession to thethrone.
2This religious exclusion has been under recent discussion. Any
amendment to the Act of Settlement would require the consent of theparliaments of the United Kingdom’s Dominions,
3 and may also require the
assent of the parliaments of all independent member countries of theCommonwealth which recognise the Queen as Head of State.
The line of succession
Succession to the Crown traditionally devolves according to the principles ofprimogeniture, that is to say that male heirs, and their children (irrespective ofsex), take precedence over female heirs. Again, this matter is said to be undercurrent discussion with a view to reform. Because of primogeniture, the current
line of succession is Prince Charles, his sons Prince William and Prince Henry,Andrew, Duke of York, his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie,Prince Edward, Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, and then her children,Peter and Zara Phillips, and thereafter to other members of the Royal Familyin a predetermined line of succession.
Were the Queen to abdicate, in favour of an early succession by Prince
Charles, the assent of the parliaments of the Dominions would be required.The only precedent case is that of King Edward VIII, who abdicated in 1936 inorder to avoid the constitutional crisis which was perceived to be imminent ifhe persisted in his intention to marry the American divorcee, WallisSimpson.
4
The Regency Acts
Should the Crown fall ‘vacant’, through death or (more rarely) abdication, orthe Monarch becomes too ill to fulfil his or her constitutional duties,
5and the
successor has not yet reached the age of majority, there will be a need for theappointment of an adult with responsibility for the Crown’s duties during thesuccessor’s minority. This situation is regulated under the Regency Acts1937–53. 
The Regency Act 1937 provides that the Sovereign may appoint
Counsellors of State, charged with the responsibility of carrying out theChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law
3062 For this reason, Prince Michael of Kent was excluded from the line of succession upon
his marriage to a Catholic in 1978.
3 Statute of Westminster 1931. Australia and Canada have Dominion status. New
Zealand ceased to be a Dominion in 1987: see the Constitution Act 1986 (NZ), s 26.
4 See His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936.
5 As occurred in the reigns of George III (in 1811) and George VI (in 1938).

Central Government
Sovereign’s duties whenever he or she is either absent from the United
Kingdom, or suffering from temporary physical or mental illness. Thoseeligible to be appointed include the Monarch’s spouse and the next fourpersons in line of succession.
Where there is the need to appoint a Regent, the Regency Act 1937
provides that, until the heir to the Throne reaches the age of 18, his or herduties will be carried out by a Regent.
6The appointment of a Regent
continues until it is declared to be no longer necessary by the wife or husbandof the Monarch, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker, the Lord Chief Justice andthe Master of the Rolls.
The Royal Titles Act 1953
By statute, the Monarch may assume whatever title she thinks fit, with theassent of member governments of the Commonwealth. The Royal Titles Actprovides the title:
Elizabeth II by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of theCommonwealth, Defender of the Faith.
Within the Commonwealth, it was agreed in 1952 that the title of the Monarch
within the Commonwealth was for each state to determine.7Accordingly, the
only title of the Monarch which is uniform throughout the Commonwealth isthat of ‘Head of the Commonwealth’. 
Prince Charles has recently made it known that he would prefer, on
succession, to be known as ‘Defender of Faith’, rather than Defender of the(Protestant) Faith.
The Civil List
The Civil List is a fund provided by parliament for the financing ofexpenditure on official business by the Monarch and specified members of herfamily. The Civil List is designed to offset expenditure incurred on officialbusiness; the cost of maintaining royal residences and the salaries andpensions payable to employees of the Crown.
8The List was established in the
reign of George III (1760–1820) and represents an agreement wherebyparliament will vote monies for the official business of the Royal Family inexchange for the surrender of hereditary revenues held by the Crown.

9 With the exception of revenues from the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster.

revenues are paid directly into the Exchequer and become part of the
Consolidated Fund.10Payments under the Civil List are provided for by the
Civil List Act 1952, as amended.11The Civil List Act 1972 made separate
provision for the Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Familywho undertake public duties in the name of the Crown. In 1992, the Queentook over financial responsibility for members of the Royal Family, althoughthe Duke of Edinburgh still receives separate provision under the Civil List, asdid the late Queen Mother. Financial provision for the Prince of Wales is madefrom the revenues accruing from the Duchy of Cornwall.
Taxation and the Sovereign
Until 1992, the Sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her private property12
unless an Act of Parliament so determined. From 1993, the Queen, on her ownundertaking, has paid tax on her private income. 
The Crown Estate
Revenues from Crown lands and from other sources are managed by theCrown Estate Commissioners
13under the authority of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Commissioners lay anannual report before parliament. It is these revenues which are exchanged forprovision under the Civil List.
The role of the Monarch in the United Kingdom’s constitutional
democracy
In Walter Bagehot’s often-quoted phrase, the Monarch has the right to ‘be
consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn’ (1867). As such, theQueen must be fully informed of the actions of her government, and givenadequate opportunity to express her views.
If the role of the Monarch is to remain respected by governments of all
political persuasions, and the nation, it is axiomatic that the Queen be seenformally to be immune from party-political differences and to fulfil her dutiesin an even-handed manner. This is not to suggest that the Queen has no viewson her government’s policies or that she should not express them to the PrimeMinister. What is required, however, is the absolute confidentiality ofdiscussions between herself and the Prime Minister, and, should there be adisagreement over policy, it is required that, once the Monarch’s views areChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Central Government
made known, irrespective of her approval or otherwise, she follows the advice
of her Prime Minister on policy matters.14
Queen Elizabeth II, since her accession to the throne in 1952, has presided
over 35 years of Conservative rule and 15 years of Labour rule. She has thusaccumulated a wealth of experience in political matters unmatched by herindividual Prime Ministers. 
The ‘modernisation’ of the monarchy? 
Public perceptions that the monarchy is out-dated and needs reform havebeen recognised by the Royal Family. The Queen heads the ‘Way AheadGroup’, which comprises senior members of the Royal Family and meets toconsider reform. Among recent proposals are that the use of the royal titleHRH should be confined to the monarch and his or her immediate successors;that, in the future, the right of those members of the Royal Family entitled totake their seats in the House of Lords should be removed;
15and that the state
opening of parliament should be less formal. It has also been suggested thatKensington Palace, former home of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, andhome to other members of the Royal Family, should become an art galleryhousing the royal art collection. On the matter of style, the Queen supports theview that people should not be required either to curtsey or bow on meetingthe monarchy.
The state opening of parliament
At the start of each new parliamentary session, the Monarch formally opensparliament. The Queen’s Speech is formally delivered to the House of Lordswith members of the House of Commons having been summoned to theLords by Black Rod. The Speech outlines the government of the day’sproposals for legislation in the forthcoming session. Thereafter, there is a fouror five day debate on the Speech in the Commons.
THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION 
BETWEEN CROWN AND GOVERNMENT
Government papers
The Monarch receives copies of all significant government papers. She alsoreceives copies of reports from ambassadors abroad and Commonwealth
30914 See the letter to The Times , by the Queen’s Press Secretary, Sir William Heseltine, 29 July
1986.
15 This proposed reform is consistent with the government’s plans to abolish the right of
hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. See, further, Chapter 17.

High Commissioners. All Cabinet papers and the minutes of Cabinet meetings
are received by the Queen. 
The weekly prime ministerial audience
Whatever the pressure of work, the Prime Minister attends a weekly half toone hour audience with the Queen. It is at this weekly meeting that issues willbe discussed and the Queen’s views made known to the Prime Minister.
16
Channels of communication are facilitated by the Queen’s Private Secretary,whose appointment is the choice of the Queen, and who on appointment willbecome a Member of the Privy Council. The Private Secretary may not belongto any political party. Very rarely will the Queen’s Private Secretary be drawninto public debate although, in 1986, the then Private Secretary, Sir WilliamHeseltine, wrote to The Times (following public claims that the Queen and
Prime Minister – then Mrs Thatcher – disagreed on policy matters). In hisletter, Sir William Heseltine spelled out three main points concerning therelationship between the Crown and the Prime Minister:
(a) the Sovereign has the right and duty to counsel, encourage and warn her
government. She is thus entitled to have opinions on government policy
and to express them to the Prime Minister;
(b) whatever the Queen’s personal opinions may be, she is bound to accept
and act on the advice of her Ministers;
(c) the Sovereign is obliged to treat communications with the Prime Minister
as entirely confidential.17
Privy Council meetings
See below.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Historical origins
Since 1066, the monarch has appointed a Chancellor, who was head of the
King’s administration and had custody of the Great Seal. The Chancellor hadresponsibility for the administration of law, drawing up royal writs andexercising judicial powers. The Chancellor has always been a Member of theKing’s Council. The Privy Council may be viewed as the successor to the Curia
Regis , the supreme legislative, executive and judicial body. The Council is
traceable to the thirteenth century. It was through the Privy Council thatmonarchs would rule without recourse to parliament. Under Edward IChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law
31016 See, further, Brazier, 1990, Chapter 8 and 1994b, Chapter 9.
17 (1986) The Times , 29 July; see, also, Marshall, 1986b.

Central Government
(1271–1307), it was difficult to discern whether legislative acts emanated from
the King in Parliament or the King in Council.18Throughout the fourteenth
century, however, there were serious conflicts between the Council andparliament and, in the reigns of Henry IV (1399–1423) and Henry V (1413–22),there is evidence of the Commons petitioning the King against the jurisdictionseized by the Council. The Council by this time was exercising judicial powersin relation to both criminal and civil litigation. Enforcement of the criminallaw, where offences against the state were alleged or officers of state wereinvolved, was effected by the feared Court of Star Chamber.
19To this claim to
wide civil and criminal jurisdiction came parliamentary objection on the basisthat the Star Chamber was usurping the function of the common law courts.FW Maitland writes of the Council at this time that:
The Tudor reigns are, we may say, the golden age of the Council: the Council
exercises enormous powers of the most various kinds; but it is not anindependent body – as against the King it has little power or none at all. [1908,p 256]
By the reign of Henry VIII (1509–47), the Council comprised Privy Councillors
– the elite King’s advisers – and ordinary Councillors – lawyers andadministrators. Over time, the Council fragmented into committees dealingwith specified matters. The Council survived the abolition of the StarChamber, although its powers were much weakened. Following therestoration of the monarchy, it became the body on which the King relied foradvice. With the abolition of the Star Chamber, did the Council lose all itsjudicial powers? From early times the Council had asserted jurisdiction overterritory overseas which fell under the suzerainty of the English Crown. Withthe Channel Islands and the Isle of Man coming under the Crown’s protectionin the thirteenth century, the seeds were sown for the Privy Council’sjurisdiction over civil and criminal appeals from the British Empire andCommonwealth. 
With the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the rise of parliamentary
sovereignty, the role of the Council changed. Under William, the inner circleof the Council became known as the Cabinet Council. Through this Cabinet,the King could exercise all his powers, although he had to have recourse to thewider membership of the Privy Council in order to undertake acts whichrequired Orders in Council, the formal means by which such prerogative actscame into effect. It was the Privy Council which determined the summoningand dissolution of parliament, although it seems clear that the King would actthrough Orders in Council published after consultation with an inner circle ofthe Privy Council. The early origins of Cabinet government can be seen here.As FW Maitland observed:
31118 Maitland, 1908, p 136.
19 Abolished in 1640.

We now see how it is legally possible for the work of government to fall into
the hands of a small number of the Council – those Members who hold thehigh offices of state and who have control over the seals of office. If the Kinghas with him the Chancellor, the Treasurer or First Lord of the Treasury, theLord Privy Seal, and the Secretaries of State, he can get his work done withoutconsulting the mass of Privy Councillors. If, for any purpose, an Order inCouncil is required, a meeting of the King with just these few intimate adviserswill be a good enough meeting of the Privy Council at which Orders inCouncil can be made. So much is the legal possibility of Cabinet government.[1908, p 394]
While King William and Queen Anne attended Council meetings regularly, a
change of practice occurred with the reign of George I (1714–27) and George II(1727–60). Neither could speak English, and nor were they particularlyconcerned with English matters. Accordingly, the Cabinet began to meetwithout the King. Under George III (1760–1820), the same situation prevailed,the Cabinet meeting without the King and communicating its decision to theKing. Again, we find the origins of today’s Cabinet, with the three principlesof Cabinet government becoming apparent: those of ‘political unanimity,common responsibility to parliament and a common leader’.
20With the rise of
the Cabinet system of government in the eighteenth century, the PrivyCouncil gradually lost much of its power.
21
Composition of the Privy Council
The Privy Council has some 420 members, half of whom are peers, halfcommoners. There is no fixed number of members. Appointments are madeby the Crown, with the advice of the Prime Minister. By convention, allpresent and past Cabinet members are appointed to the Privy Council. Alsoincluded in the membership are members of the Royal Family, senior judges,two Archbishops, British Ambassadors, the Speaker of the House ofCommons, present and former leaders of the Opposition, and leadingCommonwealth spokesmen and judges. On appointment, a new member ofthe Council takes the oath of allegiance, or affirms loyalty. The Privy Counciloath binds the member to secrecy in relation to any matters discussed in theCouncil.
22
Meetings of the Privy Council
The Privy Council may meet wherever the Queen so decides although,normally, the Council will meet at Buckingham Palace. The quorum is three. Chapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

21 See Mackintosh, 1977, Chapter 2. On the constitutional struggles between King, courts
and parliament, see Chapter 6.
22 Privy Councillors would in any event be prevented from disclosing confidential
information by virtue of the Official Secrets Acts 1911–89.

Central Government
FUNCTIONS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Proclamations and Orders in Council
Proclamations are used for the summoning, proroguing and dissolving of
parliament and declarations of war and peace. Orders in Council give effect todecisions reached under the royal prerogative and under statute. Orders inCouncil may be legislative, executive or judicial. 
Committees of the Privy Council
The majority of Privy Council functions are undertaken in committees.Miscellaneous committees have been established. These include committeesdealing with scientific research, universities and the granting of charters. Themost important committee is the Judicial Committee. 
The Judicial Committee was established under statute by the Judicial
Committee Act 1833. The Judicial Committee Act 1844 provided that theQueen may, by Order in Council, admit appeals from courts of Britishcolonies or overseas territories. The Judicial Committee is composed of theLord Chancellor, Lord President and former Lord Presidents of the Council,Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and the Lord Justices of Appeal, former LordChancellors and retired Lords of Appeal; senior judges or former judges ofthose Commonwealth countries from which a right of appeal still lies.
23
In addition to its appellate jurisdiction, the Judicial Committee will on
occasion examine and report on matters of constitutional importance. It has,for example, examined the legality of telephone tapping, issues of Statesecurity, and British policy in relation to the Falkland Islands. 
THE OFFICE OF PRIME MINISTER24
As with so much of the United Kingdom’s constitution the office of PrimeMinister is one which developed by convention rather than by law. The officedates from the early eighteenth century,
25but had become firmly established
as a necessary and inevitable post in the latter half of the nineteenth century,when the extension of the franchise combined with the growth of politicalparties to produce both a (reasonably) accountable government and anopposition party. The first official recognition of the post of Prime Ministerderives from the Treaty of Berlin 1878, and statutory and other formalreferences to the office remain scant.

II.

and Other Pensions Act 1972, the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975,
Ministerial and Other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991.

In 1889, Lord Morley27stated that:
... the Prime Minister is the keystone of the Cabinet arch. Although in Cabinet
all its members stand on an equal footing, speak with an equal voice, and, onthe rare occasions when a division is taken, are counted on the fraternalprinciple of one man, one vote, yet the head of the Cabinet is primus inter pares,
and occupies a position which, so long as it lasts, is one of exceptional andpeculiar authority.
Little has changed over the intervening century and the judgment expressed
above remains true today. Sir Anthony Eden28has written that:
A Prime Minister is still nominally primus inter pares, but in fact his authority is
stronger than that. The right to choose his colleagues, to ask for a dissolution of
Parliament and, if he is a Conservative, to appoint the Chairman of the partyorganisation, add up to a formidable total of power.
Contemporary interest focuses on the power of the office, the relationship
between the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and the occasional dominance ofthe Prime Minister over Cabinet colleagues.
29One question which inevitably
arises is whether government has changed from being parliamentarygovernment, through to being best described as Cabinet government and nowthrough to prime ministerial government.
30The assessment of this question is
a matter for evaluation on consideration of the evidence. It must berecognised, however, that the extent to which there exists prime ministerialdominance will depend very much upon the individual personality of theincumbent Prime Minister: there can be no broad generalisations. It must alsobe recognised that, whatever the personal power of the Prime Minister, he orshe is ultimately dependent upon the support of Cabinet, party andparliament; and, in turn, that support is dependent upon the support of theelectorate expressed not just through the vote at a general election, butcontinually expressed in that amorphous concept ‘the mood of the people’.

Central Government
formally in charge of the Treasury, although in practical terms it is the
Chancellor of the Exchequer who runs the Treasury. It is in part because of therole of First Lord of the Treasury that the Prime Minister must be a Member ofthe House of Commons which has parliamentary supremacy over financialmatters.
33Since 1937, the Ministers of the Crown Act has assumed that the
office of Prime Minister and First Lord are held by the same person. Since1968, the Prime Minister has also held responsibility for the Civil Service asMinister for the Civil Service.
34On occasions, Prime Ministers will assume
other offices. For example, Ramsey MacDonald also held office as ForeignSecretary (Labour government, 1924); Winston Churchill was also Minister ofDefence.
The Prime Minister and membership of the House of Commons
Between 1837 and 1902, six Prime Ministers were peers.35However, as early
as 1839, the Duke of Wellington expressed the view that:
I have long entertained the opinion that the Prime Minister of this country,
under existing circumstances, ought to have a seat in the other House ofParliament, and that he would have great advantage in carrying on thebusiness of the Sovereign by being there.
36
With the extension of the franchise in 1832, 1867 and 1884, the supremacy of
the Commons over the Lords was firmly established and the role of the Houseof Lords in legislation was reduced significantly by the Parliament Acts of1911 and 1949. There are good reasons – aside from the office of First Lord ofthe Treasury – for arguing that the Prime Minister must be a member of theHouse of Commons. First, he is today the elected leader of the parliamentaryparty and must lead that party into a general election for an affirmation – ordenial – of the party’s, and hence his own, mandate. Secondly, the doctrine ofindividual and collective ministerial responsibility applies to the PrimeMinister as it does to all other holders of office. Above all, the doctrinesrequire that a minister is accountable to the electorate through parliament. Forthe Prime Minister not to be accountable to the democratically-elected Houseof Commons would effectively defeat the concept of collective responsibilityand would be an affront to democracy and the very idea of constitutionalism.Certainly, no breach of law would follow if the Queen invited a peer to takeoffice as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury: but it would clearly flyin the face of convention.

The choice of Prime Minister37
A change in Prime Minister will be brought about by either resignation or
death or – rarely – dismissal of the office holder. Resignation from office maystem from electoral defeat at a general election, from conflict within thegovernment, from losing the support of the party, from losing a vote ofconfidence in the House, from a challenge to the leadership of the party, fromillness or old age, from death, from voluntary retirement or from loss ofsupport of the Cabinet.
38
Whatever the explanation for a change in Prime Minister, it is for the
monarch to appoint the succeeding Prime Minister. It was seen in Chapter 6that it is the prerogative right of the Crown to appoint whosoever she please,but that by convention rather than law the Queen appoints as Prime Ministerthe leader of the political party who can command a majority in the House ofCommons. In the days before the major parties chose their leaders by someform of election, some discretion was left to the Queen as to the choice ofPrime Minister. Nowadays, such discretion is all but dead, other than where ageneral election produces a situation where there is no overall majority partyin the House of Commons.
The actual choice of Prime Minister will thus be dictated by the election
process within the major political parties
39and, where relevant, by the result
of a general election.40The three major parties, Conservative, Labour and
Liberal Democrat, all differ in their approach to choice of leadership. TheConservative Party elects its leader annually, by ballot, at the start of the newparliamentary session. If there is only one nomination, as may occur wherethere is unity as to the choice of a new leader, or where the incumbent leadercontinues to enjoy the support of the Party, that person is declared leader.Should there be a contest for the leadership, as in 1990, the choice will bedetermined by up to three secret ballots among the Party’s Members ofParliament. In order to win on the first ballot the candidate must receive anoverall majority of the votes cast and 15 per cent more votes than any othercandidate.
41If the matter goes to a second ballot, all candidates must resubmit
their names and the result will be determined by a simple majority. If nocandidate wins an outright majority of votes on the second ballot, a thirdChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

42Until 1993, the Labour Party’s arrangements were complex and
involved not only Members of Parliament. The Party’s Constitution providedthat the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Party shall be elected from membersof the Parliamentary Labour Party at the annual Party Conference, with votesgiven to Members of Parliament, Trade Unions (but not their individualmembers) and members of local parties, each being proportionallydetermined. The procedure for the election of Leader of the Labour Party wasreviewed in 1992–93, with John Smith being determined to reform the systemin order to give one vote to each member of trade unions, thus replacing the‘block’ union vote. Following John Smith’s death in 1994, Tony Blair waselected under the reformed system.
The Constitution of the Liberal Democrats provides the circumstances
under which a leadership election may be called for, and the rules for election,which include entitlement to vote by Liberal Democrat Members ofParliament and members of local parties and specified associatedorganisations.

THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PRIME MINISTER44
Formation of Cabinet45
Once in office, the first task of the Prime Minister is to form his Cabinet.Constitutionally, the appointment of all ministers is a decision for themonarch but, in practice, it is the Prime Minister who determines who shall beappointed. The Prime Minister decides which government departmentsshould be represented in Cabinet although, by convention, certainDepartments are always represented. Thus, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Home
31742 Four contested elections have taken place: 1965, Edward Heath elected; 1975, Margaret
Thatcher elected; 1990, John Major elected; 1997, William Hague elected.
43 Only two elections have been held under the constitution of the new merged Liberal
Democrat Party, electing first Paddy Ashdown and, subsequently, Charles Kennedy as
Leader of the Party.
44 The Prime Minister (Office, Role and Functions) Bill 2001 provides, inter alia , for the
Prime Minister to be appointed with the consent of the House of Commons; permits thePrime Minister to appoint ministers from outside parliament; and invests the PrimeMinister with most of the remaining prerogative powers, but not the dissolution orprorogation of parliament.
45 See Jennings, 1959a, Chapter III.

Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Defence, the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Leader of the House of Commonsalways hold a seat in Cabinet. Further constraints on membership exist. Forexample, under the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975, certain Cabinet positionsare allocated to Members of the House of Lords. Accordingly, the LordChancellor and three other ministers are appointed from that House. Further,under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975, the size of Cabinet iseffectively controlled – if indirectly – by limiting the number of ministers whomay draw a ministerial salary. 
It is also for the Prime Minister to decide whether Cabinet Members
should remain in office, and he has the right to require a member to resignand, if he refuses, to request the Queen to dismiss him. This form of controlwas most strikingly seen in 1962 when Harold Macmillan in ‘the night of thelong knives’ removed seven ministers (from a Cabinet of 20) overnight. TheCabinet normally comprises approximately 20 senior members of thegovernment of the day. The actual membership is not fixed, and is (subject toconvention) for the Prime Minister to determine.

Cabinet meetings
The Prime Minister has almost total control over the conduct of Cabinet. The
holding and conduct of Cabinet meetings is a matter for the Prime Minister todecide. Traditionally, but not invariably, full meetings of Cabinet are heldtwice a week. Under the leadership of Mrs Thatcher, the number of fullCabinet meetings was reduced, and the number of Cabinet Committeesincreased. Matters which are to be discussed in Cabinet are for the PrimeMinister to determine.
47In the course of the ‘Westland affair’ (discussed
below, p 348) the Secretary of State for Defence, Michael Heseltine, wasexpecting to be able to put his case for the European rescue bid of thehelicopter company to a Cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister, however,allegedly cancelled that meeting, thus precipitating Heseltine’s resignationfrom office.
48
Timing of dissolution of parliament
The timing of the dissolution of parliament is within the Prime Minister’sdiscretion and there is no requirement, either in law or convention, that thePrime Minister submit his choice of date to the Cabinet. On the dissolution ofparliament, see, further, Chapter 6.
Appointments
The Prime Minister has significant powers and influence over theappointment of persons to senior positions. For example, it is the PrimeMinister who is responsible for the appointment of a Commission to overseethe work of the Security Service, and his consent is required for theappointment of most senior civil servants. Prime Ministerial nomination leadsto the appointment of, inter alia , senior judges, bishops, and the Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration. His advice is given to the Queen on thegranting of new peerages, on honours and on appointments to the PrivyCouncil.

The role and functions of Cabinet49
A Cabinet is a combining committee – a hyphen which joins, a buckle which
fastens the legislative part of the state to the executive part of the state. In itsorigins, it belongs to the one and in its functions, it belongs to the other.
50
The Cabinet represents the nucleus of government. It is the Cabinet as a whole
which, at least in theoretical terms, formulates, initiates and implements thepolicy of the government. Because there is no written constitution definingand controlling the working of Cabinet, it is not possible to give a fixedpicture of its role. The use and working of Cabinets will vary with differentgovernments and the different style and personality of the Prime Minister ofthe day. 
As the central decision making body, the Cabinet has great power in
relation to parliament as a whole, in relation to the political party it representsand in relation to the Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister may controlthe composition and working of Cabinet, no Prime Minister can ultimatelysurvive in office without the support of Cabinet and party.
51The style of
leadership will depend upon the personality of the premier, and an evaluationof whether it is parliamentary government, Cabinet government or PrimeMinisterial government will also depend upon the strength of the PrimeMinister vis à vis his or her colleagues.
Cabinet committees
In order to facilitate efficiency, the Cabinet is supported by a system ofcommittees which, again, is largely determined by the Prime Minister.
52Some
of these are standing committees which will exist for the life of thegovernment. Ad hoc committees may be established to consider particularmatters. In addition, a whole range of official committees staffed by civilservants exist to complement the work of Ministers. Professor Peter Hennessyhas analysed the pattern of committee formation under several governments:
Attlee accumulated 148 standing and 313 ad hoc groups in six and a quarter
years, and Churchill 137 and 109 respectively in three and a half years. Thefigures for Eden are incomplete, and those for Macmillan and Home remain amystery which the current Cabinet Secretary refuses to resolve. Thanks to MrsCastle’s Diary we have some intelligence on Wilson Mark I. Elected in October
1964, he had by early 1969 (that is, after four and a quarter years) reached his236th ad hoc group. The Heath era is another unknown. Wilson Mark II,between March 1974 and March 1976, ran up a total of somewhere around 120ad hoc groups. Callaghan, in the three years between April 1976 and AprilChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Central Government
1979, commissioned about 160 ad hoc committees, a similar growth rate to
Attlee’s. Judging by the Cabinet committee criterion, Mrs Thatcher has doneexceedingly well. Under her, there have been 30–35 standing committees andjust over 120 ad hocs in six and a half years. So Cabinet andCabinet committee
discussion is down. [1986b, pp 100–01]
While the use of committees is both necessary and inevitable, it raises
important constitutional questions concerning the doctrine of collectiveresponsibility. Collective responsibility requires that each member of Cabinet,and all government ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries, is boundby the decision of the Cabinet. The extent to which the doctrine will in practicebe binding will depend upon the extent government members are prepared tomaintain confidentiality and unanimity over decisions in which they mayhave played no part.
The Prime Minister’s Private Office
While often mooted, and its absence an apparent anomaly in a sophisticatedsystem of government, there has never been a ‘Prime Minister’s Department’dedicated to the task of organising, co-ordinating and liaising on behalf of thePrime Minister. Instead, a British Prime Minister’s team comprises civilservice support and non-civil service political support in the form of aspecially appointed team of advisers. Heading the Prime Minister’s supportsystem is his Principal Private Secretary who heads the Private Office, whohas close relations with both the Cabinet Secretary and the Queen’s PrivateSecretary. A civil servant, usually seconded from the Treasury for a three yearperiod, it is the Private Secretary who co-ordinates the work of the PrimeMinister, controlling the flow of paper into Number 10, and prioritisingmatters for prime ministerial attention. In addition to the Private Secretary,there is a Private Secretary for Overseas and Defence Affairs, Economic andHome Affairs, Europe, Central and Constitutional Affairs and Security andIntelligence. The Private Secretaries link the Prime Minister with Cabinet,other government ministers and civil servants, and attend prime ministerialmeetings and Cabinet meetings. The Prime Minister’s Diary Secretary – apolitical appointment since 1979 – also plays a key role in the inner corpus ofprime ministerial support, controlling the Prime Minister’s time andengagements. A Duty Clerk is responsible for maintaining links betweenNumber 10 and the outside world, and manning the Prime Minister’s office inthe absence of the Private Secretary. The Prime Minister’s secretariat, knownas the ‘Garden Room Girls’ ( sic) since Lloyd George’s premiership, completes
the support staff at Number 10. These appointments represent the PrimeMinister’s staff in his role as head of government. In addition, the PrimeMinister must maintain close links with his parliamentary party and with theparty in the country. Given the requirement of political neutrality in civil
321

servants, this would be an inappropriate task for the Private Office and, as a
result, this responsibility falls on the Prime Minister’s Political Secretary, apost funded by the party rather than the taxpayer. Harold Wilson was the firstPrime Minister to formally appoint a Political Secretary, Marcia Williams, andall subsequent Prime Ministers have felt the need for this particular supportmechanism. A Parliamentary Private Secretary, a Member of Parliament,assists in liaison with the party, meeting Members of Parliament,accompanying the Prime Minister for Prime Minister’s Question Time andgenerally facilitating lines of communication between the party and its leader. 
The Cabinet Office53
The daily working of Cabinet is assisted by the Cabinet Office,54established in
1917, headed by the Secretary to the Cabinet. It is the Secretary to the Cabinetwho is responsible for the recording of Cabinet meetings and circulation of theagreed conclusions. Within the Cabinet Office, there exists a number ofsecretariats, including the Economic Secretariat; Overseas and DefenceSecretariat; European Secretariat and Home and Social Affairs Secretariat.
55
Between 1970 and 1983, there existed within the Cabinet Office the CentralPolicy Review staff whose principal task was to keep policy choices andimplementation under review and to advise ministers.
56The Central Policy
Review staff – or ‘Think Tank’ – stood between the Civil Service and theCabinet and was regarded as invaluable by Prime Minister JamesCallaghan.
57However, in Mrs Thatcher’s first administration,58some of the
Think Tank’s proposals were too radical and the unit was destined to beclosed down,
59to be replaced with a Policy Unit whose function is to serve
the Prime Minister rather than Cabinet as a whole.
THE CIVIL SERVICE60
A civil servant has been defined as: ‘... a servant of the Crown, other thanholders of political or judicial offices, who is employed in a civil capacity andwhose remuneration is paid wholly and directly out of monies voted byParliament.’

HMSO.

Central Government
The constitutional relationship between the Civil Service and the
government of the day is a matter directly linked to ministers’ responsibility
to the electorate – through parliament – and the extent to which thatresponsibility is affected by the role of civil servants. Before considering therelationship between ministers and departments, some preliminary pointsrequire attention. Some doubt exists as to the precise number of personnel inthe Civil Service, doubts which arise from the difficulties concerning theappropriate classification of some occupations within the public service. Forexample, employees of the National Health Service are not technicallyemployees of the Crown – and therefore not civil servants – althoughresponsibility for the Health Service lies with the Secretary of State. 
One further difficulty in evaluating the operation of the Civil Service arises
from the disparity in size between government departments, with somedepartments having a staff of over 100,000, while others may have less than10,000. The size of a department has a practical bearing on the extent to whichministers can realistically be said to be making decisions. Added to thatdifficulty is the preference of some governments for large departments ofstate. Moreover, recent changes to the structure of the Civil Service to enhanceits efficiency have led to a proliferation of government agencies (see below). 
By way of example of the disparity in size of departments, in 1951, the
Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, appointed Lord Leathers as Secretary ofState with responsibility for the co-ordination of transport, fuel and powerand Lord Woolton as Lord President of the council with special responsibilityfor the co-ordination of food and agriculture. These two ministers becameknown as the ‘Overlords’ and the appointments were much criticised by theOpposition as weakening the responsibility of ministers running theDepartments and also on the basis that both ‘Overlords’ were Members of theHouse of Lords and not the Commons.
In debate,
62the Prime Minister defended the appointments, emphasising
the close links between collective and individual responsibility, and assertingthat the co-ordinating minister’s role could best be viewed as an aspect ofcollective responsibility. In 1970, the Prime Minister, Mr Edward Heath,regarded the merging of departments as a means of achieving greaterefficiency in both management and in the implementation of governmentpolicy.
63As a result, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, Ministry
of Transport, Ministry of Public Building and Works were amalgamated toform the Department of the Environment with some 72,000 civil servants.
64
When considering responsibility for the Civil Service and accountability to
parliament, a further feature of political life must be borne in mind: that of
32362 6 May 1952.
63 White Paper, The Reorganisation of Central Government . 
64 The Ministry of Transport subsequently became independent once more, but is now
linked with the environment and the regions.

ministerial mobility. The average tenure of responsibility for a department is
two years. The Department of Education and Science, between 1944 and 1986,had 21 ministerial heads. During the Thatcher administration (1979–90),Cabinet reshuffles were frequent with several ministers holding a number ofportfolios during that government. 
A final practical preliminary point to consider is the sheer volume of work
entailed in government. An estimated
65two-thirds of a minister’s working
week is taken up by non-departmental business: Cabinet meetings, Cabinetcommittees, parliamentary party meetings, debates and questions in theHouse, official visits, and constituency duties. The task of heading a majordepartment of state in addition to all the other duties is a major one, and thepractical impact of regular government ‘re-shuffles’, the size of departmentsand non-departmental duties is great. Such considerations lead the observer towonder whether ministers, rather than senior civil servants, can truly be saidto be in charge of their Departments. 
Not too much must be made of this matter, but it can be noted that senior
politicians such as Tony Benn, Richard Crossman, Michael Meacher andBarbara Castle (each of whom has held Cabinet office) have all given somecredence to what may be dubbed the ‘conspiracy theory of government’. TonyBenn advances this criticism of the Civil Service:
The Civil Service sees itself as being above party battle, with a political position
of its own to defend against all-comers, including incoming governmentsarmed with their philosophy and programme. 
However, Peter Hennessy warns that:
It is easy but wrong to take away the impression from reading the literature onWhitehall that officials do behave rather like keepers at the zoo watching theantics of their charges – Ministers – with a mixture of familiarity, superiorityand detachment.
66
THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE
Improving efficiency in the Civil Service
From November 1986 to March 1987, the Efficiency Unit, under the
supervision of Sir Robin Ibbs, inquired into the future of the Civil Service.67
A principal interest of the Unit was expressed to be not so much the
detailed working of the Civil Service or its efficiency, but rather therelationship between the Civil Service and ministerial responsibility, and theimpact which any recommendations as to the improvement of efficiencywithin the Civil Service might have on this constitutional relationship.Chapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

66 Hennessy, 1986b, p 499.67 Report to the Prime Minister, Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps, 1988,
London: HMSO.

Central Government
On the management and efficiency front, the Unit reported several
difficulties, inter alia : that there was a lack of clear and accountable
management responsibility within departments; that there was a lack of
clarity as to what was expected of individuals; that the size and diversity ofthe Civil Service made it difficult to impose a uniform system; that there was aneed to reorganise the Civil Service in such a way that efficiency wouldimprove so as to ensure ‘value for money’.
The report recommended that agencies be established – either within or
outside of the departments – charged with the responsibility of overallmanagement of the Department. By 1996, 130 agencies had been created.
The main controls would continue to lie with ministers or the Permanent
Secretary but, once policy objectives and budgets had been established, theAgency should have as much independence as possible in deciding howobjectives should be met. The crucial question was that of the line ofresponsibility. The Head of the Agency should be given personalresponsibility to achieve the best results.
As to the future role of ministers, the report recommended that ministers
continue to be wholly responsible for policy but that it was unrealistic tosuppose that they could have in-depth knowledge about every operationalquestion:
... the convention that they do is part of the cause of the overload which we
observed. We believe it is possible for Parliament, through Ministers, to regardmanagers as directly responsible for operational matters.
The (Social Security) Benefits Agency is the largest. Others include the Child
Support Agency,68the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Stationery
Office, the Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, Patent Office and UnitedKingdom Passport Agency. Issues of responsibility of ministers are also raisedin respect of non-departmental public bodies – ‘quangos’ – whereby stateenterprises are privatised.
69A non-departmental public body is defined as a
body ‘which has a role in the processes of national government but is not agovernment department’.
70The movement towards increased government
involvement in commerce and industry stems from 1945, although publiccorporations had been earlier established.
71Today, the movement is towards
privatisation, with, among others, British Rail, British Gas, British Telecom,Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, and the Naval Dockyards being sold into

inefficiency.

private ownership. Accountability for such organisations, when publicly
owned, was weak. Today the question is to what extent these organisationsare truly private; to what extent ministers exert control over them, whether viafinancial power or the power to issue policy guidance; and, more importantly,the extent to which parliament assures that ministers are accountable for theimplementation of policies. 
The Labour government and the civil service
When the government entered into office in May 1997, it arrived with not onlya radical mandate to reform the constitution, but also one to improveefficiency in the civil service. In March 1999, the government published itsWhite Paper, Modernising Government, described by Cabinet Secretary Sir
Richard Wilson as ‘a key document which signals a change of course for theCivil Service for the next ten years as important as Next Steps ten years ago’.
72
The aim, he said, was ‘modernisation with a purpose: better policy making,better responsiveness to what people want, and more effective publicservices’. The White Paper introduced a range of reforms, including thecommitment to make public services available on a 24 hour a day, seven day aweek basis; removing unnecessary regulation and requiring departmentswhich are preparing policies involving new regulations to submit RegulatoryImpact Assessments following consultation with the Cabinet Office; creatinggreater incentives for civil servants, which includes considering financialrewards for staff who identify financial savings or service improvements. InWhitehall, all Permanent Secretaries are required to ‘ensure that theirDepartment has the capacity to drive through achievement of the keygovernment targets and to take a personal responsibility for ensuring that thishappens’. To facilitate this, the government calls for the introduction of morepeople from outside the civil service. While the focus is on improvedmanagement and the delivery of service to the consumer, sight has not beenlost of the core civil service values. Selection and promotion will remain basedon merit; political impartiality and the giving of best independent advice togovernment will be maintained. 
Five key commitments were presented in the White Paper. The first relates
to policy making which is designed to ‘deliver outcomes that matter’, ratherthan simply reacting to short term pressures. A new Centre for Managementand Policy Studies is introduced to identify and spread best practicethroughout the service. There is to be a refocus on the delivery of publicservices to ensure that services meet the needs of citizens, rather than theservice providers – ‘joined-up working’ of departments to ensure that thecitizen is not faced with bureaucratic barriers to responsibility for services.

best suppliers of services. All public bodies will be set new targets for
improving quality and effectiveness, and there will be closer monitoring toensure the maintenance of quality. The government’s information technologysystems will be geared to meeting the needs of citizens and business. APeople’s Panel, 5,000 randomly selected individuals, will be appointed toadvise government on all aspects of the provision and delivery of services.Equality, on the basis of gender, race and physical disabilities, within theservice has been highlighted. In 1999, only 18 per cent of senior civil servantswere women, and 1.6 per cent from ethnic minority backgrounds. By 2004–05,the target is to have 35 per cent women and 3.2 per cent ethnic minorities, andtargets are to be set for people with disabilities.
In January 2000, the Prime Minister’s Performance and Innovation Unit’s
report, Wiring It Up , reinforced the White Paper’s aims on modernisation
while focusing on the need for departments to engage in closer co-operationover issues which cross departmental boundaries, and the introduction ofbonuses and promotion for those who work on multi-faceted problems suchas social deprivation, crime reduction, young people at risk and rural issues. 
PERMANENCE, POLITICAL 
NEUTRALITY AND ANONYMITY
The role of the Civil Service must be considered against the constitutionalfeatures of permanence, political neutrality and anonymity.
Permanence
In many countries, such as the United States of America, the Civil Service is asemi-permanent body, the most senior posts of which change hands with achange in government. A variation on this model, which is employed inGermany and France, involves incoming ministers bringing into thedepartment with them a small body of hand picked professional advisers.Under the constitution of the United Kingdom, Civil Servants hold permanentposts, in law ‘holding office at the pleasure of the Crown’. Many aspects ofemployment protection legislation
73apply to the Civil Service, but such rights
as, for example, the right of appeal against unfair dismissal and the right tobelong to a trades union, may be revoked, under the royal prerogative.
74
Moreover, at common law, the position of civil servants is precarious. Being aservant of the Crown, they may be dismissed with no common law action forwrongful dismissal.
75However, while the formal position is insecure, in
32773 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978.

6.

practical terms civil servants enjoy a high degree of security. Terms and
conditions of employment are regulated under the prerogative, and theMinister for the Civil Service has power to make regulations relating to theconditions of service of all civil servants.
76
The constitutional significance of permanency lies in the development of
expertise and the natural growth of a Civil Service ‘ethos’. Most importantly,permanency ensures the availability of such expertise to governments ofdiffering political persuasions. The Private Secretary is a minister’s closestcontact with a department, and his adviser. Of his Private Secretary, RichardCrossman wrote:
I have got to face it that his main job is to get across to me what the department
wants. The Private Office is the department’s way of keeping a watch on me, ofmaking sure that I run along the lines they want me to run on, of dividing mytime and getting the department’s policies and attitudes brought to my notice.[1977, Vol 2, p 385]
Political neutrality
The Civil Service owes its loyalty to the government of the day, irrespective of
political party, and it is imperative that the Civil Service avoids creating theimpression of political bias. While the writings of leading Labour Partypoliticians referred to above reveal scepticism as to this, its theoreticalimportance cannot be underestimated.
Following the trial of senior civil servant Clive Ponting for unauthorised
disclosure of information to a Member of Parliament,
77the Head of the Civil
Service issued Notes of Guidance on the Duties and Responsibilities of Civil
Servants in Relation to Ministers (1985, revised 1987) in which it was stated that:
The Civil Service has no constitutional personality or responsibility separate
from the duly elected government of the day. The rules make it clear that acivil servant who cannot conscientiously comply with his or her official dutiesbecause of personal opinions or convictions should take the matter up with hisor her superiors, but if unable to carry out instructions should resign from theService.
The anonymity and political neutrality of civil servants is reinforced by the
rules restricting political activity. If the Civil Service is to serve governmentsof all political persuasions, it is imperative that civil servants, whatever theirprivate political views, should not be seen to be politically active in a mannerwhich would inevitably compromise their neutrality under one political partyor another. Chapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law
32876 Civil Service Order in Council 1995.
77 See R v Ponting (1985). Ponting was charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911. He was
acquitted by the jury.

Central Government
The Civil Service is divided, for the purpose of control over political
activity, into three groups:
(a) the ‘politically free’ category which comprises industrial staff and non-
officer grades, which may freely engage in either national and local
politics; 
(b) the ‘politically restricted’ category, comprising higher staff grades who are
debarred from participating in national political activities, but may bepermitted to engage in local politics;
(c) an intermediate group which comprises those who are neither employed
in the highest or lowest grades. 
Political activities which are subject to restriction are divided into activities atboth national and local level. Those activities subject to restriction at nationallevel include standing as a candidate for election to the European Parliament;holding office in party political organisations which relate to party politics inrelation to the United Kingdom or the European Parliament; and speaking onmatters of national political controversy, or expressing such views to the pressor in books, articles or leaflets. Canvassing on behalf of a candidate forelection to the United Kingdom Parliament or the European Parliament, or onbehalf of a political party in respect of such elections, is also prohibited. Atlocal level, civil servants in the restricted category may not stand as candidatesfor local elections; hold office in party political organisations relating to localgovernment; speak on local politically controversial matters or express suchviews in the media or other publications; and may not canvass on behalf ofeither a candidate or a political party in the course of local elections.
78
Anonymity
In order that the minister be seen to be responsible and accountable for theworking of his Department, the Civil Service has traditionally been shieldedfrom the public gaze and protected from public inquiry. By protecting theCivil Service, its impartiality and integrity is enhanced. Further, if civilservants become public figures scrutinised in parliament or the media, theircapacity for maintaining the appearance of political impartiality, so importantto the concept of permanence, would be damaged.
It has been seen that the minister in charge of a particular government
department is absolutely responsible to parliament for the conduct of civilservants, and that this responsibility in turn involves two aspects. The first ofthese is that the minister has an obligation to explain and answer for the workof his department to parliament; the second is that the minister is responsiblein constitutional terms for any failure of departmental policy andadministration. As a corollary to ministerial responsibility, the Civil Service isnot accountable to parliament and is protected by the concept of anonymity.
32978Pay and Conditions of Service Code .

While, in theoretical constitutional terms, the anonymity of civil servants is
important in buttressing the responsibility of ministers of the Crown, it is
becoming, as will be seen below, an increasingly less notable feature of theCivil Service. The explanations for the decrease in anonymity are manifold:the vagaries of individual ministerial responsibility, the increasing strength ofdepartmental select committees and the televising of those proceedings andrecent developments in the management of government departments.
The official Guidance for Officials Appearing before Select Committees
79
stressed that civil servants should be ‘as helpful as possible’ to parliamentarycommittees, but that advice given to ministers should never be disclosed (inorder to protect collective ministerial responsibility), nor should advice givenby a Law Officer be revealed. Further, officials should not give evidence aboutmatters of political controversy, or ‘sensitive information’ relating tocommercial or economic matters or related to inter-governmentalnegotiations. The rules make it clear that civil servants give evidence tocommittees on behalf of their ministers, and that they are subject toinstructions given by ministers.
THE CIVIL SERVICE MANAGEMENT CODE
In 1994, the Treasury and Civil Service Committee reviewed the position ofcivil servants.
80In its report, The Role of the Civil Service , it concluded that a
new Civil Service Code should be drafted to clarify the position of civilservants. The Nolan Committee also recommended clarification in theconstitutional framework within which civil servants work and ‘the valuesthey are expected to uphold’.
81The new Code was introduced under the royal
prerogative,82and came into force in 1996, replacing Sir Robert Armstrong’s
statement. The Civil Service Management Code , as amended, now states that:
... the constitutional and practical role of the Civil Service is, with integrity,
honesty, impartiality and objectivity, to assist the duly constitutedgovernment, of whatever political complexion, in formulating policies ofgovernment, carrying out decisions of the government and in administeringpublic services for which the government is responsible.
Civil servants are under a duty to give honest and impartial advice to
ministers and to:
... endeavour to deal with the affairs of the public sympathetically, effectively,
promptly and without bias or maladministration of public money.Chapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Central Government
They are also required to conduct themselves in such a manner as to:
... deserve and retain the confidence of Ministers and to be able to establish the
same relationship with those whom they may be required to serve in somefuture administration.
The Code also states that civil servants must not misuse their official position
to further their own, or another’s, personal interests.
Special advisers
The appointment of special advisers to ministers blurs the lines of
responsibility between ministers and civil servants. The Committee onStandards in Public Life examined a whole tranche of issues in 1999, includingthe role of special advisers, lobbying, sponsorship and public appointments.On special advisers, the Committee recommended that there be introduced acode of conduct enshrined in a Civil Service Act and for there to be a statutorylimit to the number of ministerial aides appointed.
83However, while
accepting that there was no evidence that special advisers were ‘politicisingthe civil service’, the Committee expressed the concern that ‘the considerableincrease in numbers, particularly at Number 10, where influential roles areplayed by special advisers, raises the question of whether their authorityoutweighs that of objective advisers’ and that ‘any future growth in numberswould raise questions about a move towards the establishment of a “cabinetsystem” within departments’.
84
Special advisers are servants of the Crown. As such there is no entitlement
to a period of notice before the termination of employment. However, theModel Contract for Special Advisers (May 1997) provides that, other than where
employment is terminated by agreement or results from disciplinaryproceedings, inefficiency or grounds justifying dismissal at common law,advisers will be given not less than three months’ notice in writing. Otherwiseemployment automatically terminates at the end of the current governmentadministration or when the relevant Cabinet minister leaves the governmentor moves to another appointment or, in the event of a general election, on theday after polling day. Schedule 1 to the Model Contract, The Role and Duties of
Special Advisers , states that special advisers ‘must always be guided by the
basic principle that they are employed to serve the objectives of thegovernment and the department in which they work’. They are exempt fromthe general civil service requirement that appointments must be made onmerit on the basis of fair and open competition, providing that they are

Assembly.
84 See Reinforcing Standards , the Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, 2000.

appointed ‘for the purpose only of providing advice to any minister’.85Their
constitutional position is ambivalent: they are ‘servants of the Crown but not a
formal part of the departmental hierarchy, do not work directly under apermanent civil servant or have permanent civil servants working for them’.‘Special Advisers are appointed to advise the minister in the development ofgovernment policy and its effective presentation.’
86As Crown employees
paid out of public funds, special advisers operate to support the interests ofthe government rather than the government’s political party, although theyact as a channel of communication between government and party.
87
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COURTS
The government, acting in the name of the Crown, has a historic right toprivileges and immunities.
88Before the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, two
main principles governed the question of the legal liability of the Crown. Thefirst principle was that ‘the King could do no wrong’ and, accordingly, couldnot be held liable for any actions which would be unlawful if committed byindividuals. The second rule was that the King could not be sued in his owncourts. Designed to protect the unique constitutional position of the Crown, asstate regulation increased, Crown privilege extended to a wide range ofcentral government activities, thereby weakening the legal protection given toindividuals aggrieved by government action. In 1947, the Crown ProceedingsAct extended the liability of the Crown to areas of tort and contract. In relationto tortious liability, the Crown is placed in the same legal position as any otheradult individual, and has the same liability for the tortious acts of itsemployees and agents as do private persons and organisations. Twoimportant exceptions to liability remain: liability in respect of actions ofmembers of the armed forces while on duty or on premises used for thepurposes of the armed forces, and liability for tortious actions committed byChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law
33285 Civil Service Order in Council 1995, Article 3(2), as amended by Civil Service
(Amendment) Order in Council 1997. A position affirmed by the Employment Appeal
Tribunal, which ruled in Lord Chancellor and Another v Coker and Another (2001) that the
Lord Chancellor did not discriminate against two women, one of whom was black, onthe grounds of sex or race when he appointed as special adviser a white male who waswell known to him, without advertising the post. The appointment process with regardto special advisers was not subject to the general rules that applied to the appointmentof civil servants since special advisers were not civil servants. In appointing a specialadviser, a key quality of the applicant was a commitment to the political understandingof the particular minister.

the Post Office.89In respect of a breach of statutory duties imposed on private
persons, the Crown is liable where the statute in question is one which binds
the Crown.90It was originally thought that the unique position of the Crown
meant that the remedies of specific performance and injunctions were notavailable against the Crown. In M v Home Office (1993), however, the Home
Secretary was held to be liable in his official, but not personal, capacity for hisfailure to obey an order of the court and it was declared by the House of Lordsthat injunctions could be issued against officers of the Crown. 
Public interest immunity91
The phrase ‘Crown privilege’ has been superseded by the term ‘public interestimmunity’ or more colloquially ‘gagging orders’. One aspect of the immunitywhich is of contemporary and continuing concern is the extent to whichgovernments – and agencies of government – may be required to discloseinformation to a court of law. While the immunity from disclosure ofinformation relates principally to the government, it extends to other personsand organisations. Public interest immunity was raised, for example, in D v
NSPCC (1978)
92in order to protect the sources of information given to the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 
The need for confidentiality was also accepted in Bookbinder v Tebbit (1992)
in relation to sources of information given to the Audit Commission, whichwas investigating alleged irregularities in the financial dealings of a localauthority. The court must, however, be satisfied that there is a real need toprevent the disclosure of an informant’s identity.
93
Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, a court may order the disclosure
of documents in the interests of justice. Section 28, however, also provides thatthe power of the court in civil proceedings does not extend to disclosureswhich it would not be in the public interest to make.
There are two aspects of public interest entailed within this area of the law:
the public interest in the administration of justice and the public interest innon-disclosure of damaging information. The questions which arise are, whoit is who has the power to decide whether disclosure would or would not bein the public interest, and on what basis the ‘public interest’ is to beevaluated? 
In Duncan v Cammell Laird (1942), dependants of victims who died in the
submarine Thetis, which sank during trials, sued the builders of the

in 1969. The restrictions on liability were nevertheless retained.

submarine. Disclosure was sought of documents relating to contracts between
the Admiralty and the building contractors, and salvage reports on thesubmarine. The Admiralty refused to disclose the information, relying onnational security, and the minister certified that disclosure was against thepublic interest. The House of Lords held that the minister’s certificate wasconclusive and could not be questioned. Accordingly, the rule emerged that acourt of law could never question a claim of Crown privilege (or publicinterest immunity), irrespective of the type of documents being sought. TheHouse of Lords ruled that public interest immunity could lie in respect of thecontents of a particular document, or to a class of documents which ought tobe withheld in the interests of the proper functioning of the public service(pp 941–42). This decision altered the law and, in the words of ProfessorWade, gave the Crown the right to withhold information and thereby ‘tooverride the rights of litigants not only in cases of genuine necessity but in anycase where a government department thought fit’.
94
In 1957, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, issued a Statement.95He drew
a distinction between such documents which were absolutely necessary toprotect the ‘proper functioning of the civil service’, and documents which arerelevant to litigation but which do not require ‘the highest degree ofconfidentiality ... in the public interest’, and stated that privilege relating tomedical and other documents relevant to the defence in criminal proceedingsshould not be routinely claimed.
96The rule in Duncan v Cammell Laird ,
however, prevailed until 1967. In Conway v Rimmer (1968), the House of Lords
took a more robust attitude to a claim of public interest immunity, reversingits own decision in Duncan v Cammell Laird . In an action for malicious
prosecution against his former Superintendent of Police, the Home Secretaryobjected to the disclosure of reports made on the former police probationaryofficer. The court refused to follow the broad ruling in Duncan v Cammell Laird
and ruled that it was for the court – and not the person seeking to preventdisclosure – to rule on the competing public interests in the administration ofjustice and confidential information. Accordingly, it is for the person seekingto withhold information to assert – through the use of a public interestimmunity certificate – the right to non-disclosure, and for the court todetermine whether or not non-disclosure is in the public interest. Lord Reid,in rejecting that the power of decision lay solely with ministers of the Crown,stated that he did not doubt that:
There were certain classes of documents97which ought not to be disclosed
whatever their content may be ... To my mind the most important reason is
that such disclosure would create or fan ill informed or captious public orChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

political criticism. The business of government is difficult enough as it is, and
no government could contemplate with equanimity the inner workings of thegovernment machine being exposed to the gaze of those ready to criticisewithout adequate knowledge of the background and perhaps with an axe togrind.
In Burmah Oil Co v Bank of England (1980),the oil company sought disclosure
of information relating to the rescue of the company by the bank, in exchange
for low-priced stock in the company. The Attorney General produced a publicinterest immunity certificate from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, inwhich objection was made against producing documents sought on the basisthat it related to government policy. The House of Lords inspected thedocuments, but felt that their disclosure was unnecessary. 
A question relating to public interest immunity certificates (PIIs) which
assumed particular importance in the Arms to Iraq affair, was whether theminister was under a duty to sign the certificate when advised to do so by theAttorney General. The notion of duty arose in Air Canada v Secretary of State for
Trade (1983) in which Lord Scarman (in the minority) stated that, whilst it was
for the court to accept or deny the claim, in claiming public interest immunity,the Crown was not ‘claiming a privilege but discharging a duty’. In the Air
Canada case, the House of Lords ruled, by a majority, that the government was
entitled to immunity. At issue were the circumstances under which, in judicialreview proceedings, the court would examine documents for which immunitywas claimed. No order for disclosure can be made unless the documents areinspected by the court. The majority in the House of Lords ruled that the partyseeking disclosure of documents had to show that ‘the documents are verylikely to contain material which would give substantial support to hiscontention on an issue which arises in the case’ ( per Lord Fraser, p 917e). It
was not sufficient that the documents might reveal information relevant to thecase; it had to be established by the person seeking disclosure that it was ‘verylikely’ that the information would assist his case.
The House of Lords had the opportunity to re-examine the issue in R v
Chief Constable of West Midlands Police ex parte Wiley ; Chief Constable of
Nottinghamshire Police ex parte Sunderland (1995). In that case, the defendant,
Mr Wiley, was charged with robbery, but at his trial the prosecution offeredno evidence. He subsequently made formal complaints against the police andcommenced a civil action against the Chief Constable. Mr Sunderland hadbeen charged with assault but, again, no evidence was offered at trial by theprosecution. He also made a formal complaint against the police. He allegedassault by the police and indicated that he would institute civil proceedingsagainst them. The problem faced by both complainants was that the policehad documents which it was thought would attract public interest immunityon behalf of the police, thereby making them unavailable to the complainants.The Chief Constables concerned refused to give undertakings that thedocuments would not be used to the detriment of the complainants, and the
335

complainants secured a declaration that the Chief Constables had acted
unlawfully in refusing to give the undertakings. The Chief Constablesappealed against the declarations to the House of Lords. In the earlier case ofNeilson v Laugharne (1981),
98the House of Lords had ruled that public interest
immunity attached to police complaints documents, on the basis that if it didnot the complaints procedure would be damaged. However, the House ofLords ruled that, in principle, documents which are relevant to litigationshould be disclosed, unless that disclosure would cause ‘substantial harm’. Inparticular, Lord Templeman stated that ‘a rubber stamp approach to publicinterest immunity by the holder of a document is neither necessary norappropriate ...’ (p 281).
One aspect of the law as previously understood, and which was the cause
of much criticism in the Scott Inquiry, discussed below, was the issue ofwhether public interest immunity was a ‘right’ or a ‘duty’. The perceiveddistinction was analysed in Makanjuola v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
(1992). In that case, Bingham LJ stated that:
... where a litigant asserts that documents are immune from production or
disclosure on public interest grounds he is not (if the claim is well founded)claiming a right but observing a duty ...
Bingham LJ went on to state that:
... it [the distinction between a right and a duty] does, I think, mean: (1) thatpublic interest immunity cannot in any ordinary sense be waived, since,although one can waive rights, one cannot waive duties; (2) that, where alitigant holds documents in a class prima facie immune, he should (saveperhaps in a very exceptional case) assert that the documents are immune anddecline to disclose them, since the ultimate judge of where the balance ofpublic interest lies is not him but the court; and (3) that, where a document is,or is held to be, in an immune class, it may not be used for any purposewhatever in the proceedings to which the immunity applies, and certainlycannot (for instance) be used for the purpose of cross-examination.
Woolf LJ, while endorsing much of this analysis, noted that Makanjuola did
not involve a Department of State, represented by a Secretary of State. He
stated that:
If a Secretary of State on behalf of his department, as opposed to any ordinary
litigant, concludes that any public interest in the documents being withheldfrom production is outweighed by the public interest in the documents beingavailable for purposes of litigation, it is difficult to conceive that, unless thedocuments do not relate to an area for which the Secretary of State wasresponsible, the court would feel it appropriate to come to any differentconclusion from that of the Secretary of State. The position would be the sameChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

discrimination; distinguished in Peach v Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1986) on the
basis that the allegation is of a serious crime committed by the police, and Ex parte

if the Attorney General was of the opinion that the documents should be
disclosed.
However, that situation did not pertain to other bodies or persons, and it
could not be left to individuals to decide that documents should be disclosed.The court retained the ultimate right to determine disclosure and would‘intervene to protect the public interest’. The decision in Neilson , and those
cases in which it had been applied, was wrong and could no longer bejustified. It was not, Woolf LJ stated, that ‘there had been a change in attitudessince the Neilson decision’ but rather that ‘establishing a class of public interest
immunity of this nature was never justified’. In Wiley, the House of Lords
ruled that in Neilson and the subsequent cases in which it had been applied,
the law was incorrectly stated. The House of Lords did not, however, go so faras to say that material which came to light in investigations against the policecould never be entitled to class immunity. The European Court of HumanRights has ruled that the use of Public Interest Immunity Certificates whichprevent a judge from considering whether or not evidence should bedisclosed in the court of a murder trial violates Article 6 of the Convention.

Matrix Churchill and arms to Iraq100
Between 1987 and 1989, the Matrix Churchill company exported machinetools to Iraq. It was alleged by Customs and Excise (which brought theprosecution against the directors of the company) that those exports breachedthe export regulations in place at the time. In defence, it was argued that thegovernment knew about the exports and had in fact authorised them, and thatMI6 (the Secret Intelligence Service) was aware of the exports. When thematter came to trial, four government ministers
101signed public interest
immunity certificates, refusing disclosure of documents relating to, inter alia,
records of meetings and communications between the Department of Tradeand Industry and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The effect of thecertificates was to deny to the court the evidence which might have led to theacquittal of the defendants, each of whom was facing a significant term ofimprisonment if convicted.The trial of the directors of Matrix Churchillcollapsed after a former government minister, Alan Clark, revealed to thecourt that the government had – as the defence claimed – in fact known of theexports. The Prime Minister established the inquiry the day after the collapseof the trial.

In 1992, however, it was revealed by Alan Clark that evidence which
affected the defence was not before the court. The effect of this revelation was
the collapse of the prosecution’s case and the announcement the followingday of a judicial inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the prosecution.The decision to establish a judicial inquiry was brought about in largemeasure through the failure of select committee inquiries to unravel the fullfacts surrounding the issue.

Sir Richard Scott’s Report represented the most wide ranging judicial
inquiry into a number of important constitutional issues, including:
(a) whether the relevant government departments, agencies and responsible
ministers operated in accordance with the policies of Her Majesty’s
government;
(b) an examination of decisions taken by the prosecuting authority and those
signing public interest immunity certificates;
(c) an examination of similar cases relevant to the issues of the inquiry and to
making recommendations.104
The change in policy over exports
In 1989, government minister William Waldegrave, in response to inquiries
from Members of Parliament, advised that government policy in respect ofexports had not changed. However, in Sir Richard Scott’s view, the answersgiven were not accurate and were apt to mislead. Sir Richard accepted,however, that William Waldegrave had not in fact noticed the changedwording in the letters which, if noticed, would have alerted him to the factthat the policy had in fact changed, and that there was no intention ‘to bemisleading’ (para D4.12).
In relation to parliamentary questions concerning the policy being applied,
Sir Richard found that the government had deliberately failed to ‘informparliament of the current state of government policy on non-lethal arms salesto Iraq’ (para D4.25).
The use of public interest immunity certificates
As discussed above, the rules regulating the disclosure of documents in civiland criminal cases vary, but in each case there are common rules. First, adocument may or may not fall within a category of documents which prima
facie must be disclosed. Secondly, disclosure may be denied on the basis that
the contents of the documents fall within a particular category of disclosure orChapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

non-disclosure,105or that the documents fall within a class of documents
which may or may not be disclosed.106Thirdly, disclosure involves the
evaluation of the relevance of the information or documents, which in some
cases will be clear, but in other cases less clear until disclosed and evaluatedby counsel and the court. Over and above these rules is the public interestimmunity certificate. The public interest immunity certificate may be used toclaim that it is contrary to the public interest for information or documents tobe disclosed irrespective of the first two rules, and may be claimed on thebasis of either contents or class.
Where the government would prefer not to disclose information, and the
information falls into a ‘grey area’, there is a temptation to claim publicinterest immunity to protect the information, whereby its actual relevance tothe case in hand may go undetected.
In the case of criminal trials, it has been well established that it is the judge
who has the final say as to whether the documents in question should beproduced.
107Where, in a criminal trial, disclosure might risk the identity of a
police informant, for example, the judge must weigh in the balance the publicinterest of non-disclosure and the public interest in a fair trial for thedefendant. To come down on the side of non-disclosure where there is a riskof a miscarriage of justice for the defendant has been ruled unacceptable.
108
However, the approach taken in civil cases has differed, with the courtholding in Duncan v Cammell Laird (1942) that a minister’s certificate to the
effect that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest was conclusive.
In the Matrix Churchill trial, the government claimed that it had the
absolute right, in the name of the public interest, to withhold informationwhich was central to the defendants’ case. Accordingly, there was a confusionof the test to be applied to civil and criminal cases, to the detriment of thedefendants. Furthermore, by relying on immunity from disclosure on thebasis of a ‘class claim’, the government strengthened its case against the dutyto disclose.
It has been argued that class claims are unnecessary, in so far as all the
material concerned could equally be protected under a contents claim. In thegovernment’s view, however, class claims were essential to maintain‘candour’ between ministers and civil servants in the development of policy,and that it would be ‘wrong and inimical to the proper functioning of the
339105 Eg, non-disclosure is in the public interest if the contents reveal the identity of a police
informer, or the workings of the security services.
106 Eg, non-disclosure of Cabinet proceedings, or intergovernmental negotiations, or
documents relating to military operations. See Duncan v Cammell Laird (1942); Conway v
Rimmer (1968); Burmah Oil v Bank of England (1980); Air Canada (1983); R v Chief Constable
of West Midlands Police ex parte Wiley (1995), discussed above.

of West Midlands Police ex parte Wiley (1995).

public service if the public were to learn of these high level
communications’.109
Class claims, therefore, are supposedly to do with matters of ‘high policy’
and yet it was a class claim which the government relied on in the MatrixChurchill case although, in the view of Sir Richard Scott, many of thesedocuments ‘could not possibly have been described as relating to “highpolicy”’.
110
In Sir Richard Scott’s view, ‘it had become the practice in the Treasury
Solicitor’s Department that PII class protection for all documents relatingdirectly or indirectly to advice to ministers should be sought, whether in acivil case or in a criminal trial’. Moreover, he found that the documents whichthe government was so keen to protect caused no damage to the Intelligenceand Security Agencies, and that, in any event, if sensitive material wascontained within the documents this could have been ‘blacked out’ on thebasis of a contents claim. Moreover:
It is, I suggest, unacceptable for PII class claims to be made covering such rel-
atively routine and, in terms of ‘high policy’, unimportant documents asmany of those for which protection was sought in the Matrix Churchillcase.
111
In 1996, the Attorney General announced that, having reviewed the operation
of public interest immunity certificates, the government would no longerutilise the distinction between ‘class’ and ‘contents’ claims but rather, infuture, it would only claim public interest immunity when the government‘believed that disclosure of a document would cause real harm to the publicinterest’. The certificate will explain the nature of the harm, and the manner inwhich disclosure would harm the public interest,
112thereby allowing for
‘even closer scrutiny of claims by the court, which is always the final arbiter’.Chapter 10: Constitutional and Administrative Law

CHAPTER 11
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The convention of ministerial responsibility is central to the constitution, and
plays a fundamental role in the relationship between the executive andparliament. For the doctrine of government under the law to be observed, it isessential that government be both accountable to parliament and to theelectorate, and that government be conducted in a manner sufficiently open,subject to the requirements of the national interest, to inspire publicconfidence. The origins of ministerial responsibility are traced by FWMaitland to the principle that ‘for every exercise of royal power some ministeris answerable’ (1908, p 203). Marshall and Moodie describe ministerialresponsibility as follows:
Ministers are responsible for the general conduct of government, including the
exercise of many powers legally vested in the Monarch; and ultimately,through Parliament and parties, to the electorate. [1971, Chapter 4]
The doctrine thus has two limbs – individual and collective responsibility. As
with so much of the constitution, there is vagueness on occasion as to thedistinction between the two limbs which are both closely related and alsocomplementary of one another. In order to facilitate analysis, the topic may bebroken down into three aspects:
(a) the collective responsibility of the Cabinet to parliament, and ultimately
the electorate, for policy and administration; 
(b) the individual responsibility of ministers for the policy and administration
of his or her Department;
(c) the individual responsibility of ministers for their personal conduct.
COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY1
The convention of collective Cabinet responsibility emphasises the unanimity
of government and its accountability to parliament. The classic expression ofcollective responsibility remains that of Lord Salisbury:
For all that passes in Cabinet every member of it who does not resign is
absolutely and irretrievably responsible and has no right afterwards to say thathe agreed in one case to a compromise, while in another he was persuaded byhis colleagues ... It is only on the principle that absolute responsibility is
341RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

undertaken by every member of the Cabinet, who, after a decision is arrived at,
remains a member of it, that the joint responsibility of Ministers to Parliamentcan be upheld and one of the essential principles of parliamentaryresponsibility established. [ Official Report, HC Cols 833–34, 8 April 1878.]
The rationale for the convention lies in the need for government to present a
united front to parliament and the public in order to maintain confidence. Agovernment which exhibits public disagreements over policy matters is onewhich will be regarded as weak, and will be subjected to challenges to itsauthority to continue in office.
Two principal sub-rules underlie collective responsibility. The first rule is
that, once an agreement is reached in Cabinet, all members of Cabinet – andmany outside Cabinet – are bound to speak in support of the decision. Thereshould be no criticism or dissent from the decision in public – irrespective ofwhether or not the particular member of Cabinet was party to the discussion.Equally, if a decision is reached by the Prime Minister in Cabinet Committeeor the Inner Cabinet when only a small handful of members are present, thedecision binds all. The second supporting rule is that records of Cabinetdiscussions are absolutely secret. The knowledge that Cabinet records areprotected by confidentiality enhances the opportunity for members of Cabinetto discuss matters freely, secure in the knowledge that their personal point ofview, whatever the decision, will be protected from the public gaze. 
These principles are expressed in Questions of Procedure for Ministers in the
following manner:
Collective responsibility requires that ministers should be able to express their
views frankly in the expectation that they can argue freely in private whilemaintaining a united front when decisions have been reached. This in turnrequires that the privacy of opinions expressed in Cabinet and MinisterialCommittees should be maintained. Moreover, Cabinet and Committeedocuments will often contain information which needs to be protected in thenational interest. It is therefore essential that ministers take the necessary stepsto ensure that they and their staff preserve the privacy of Cabinet business andprotect the security of government documents. [Cabinet Office, 1992, revised2001, paragraph 17]
As with the convention of individual responsibility, there is dispute about the
status and scope of collective responsibility. So many exceptions to the classicdoctrine can be discerned that it is possible to question whether it is aconvention at all within the classical definition, or whether the termconvention should be discarded and replaced by the words practice or usage. 
Alternatively, it may be argued that the variations which can be observed
in the working of the convention merely illustrate one of the greatest strengthsof conventional rules – their flexibility.Chapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law
342

Responsible Government
Agreements to differ
It is possible for the convention of collective responsibility to be waived when
the circumstances are such that the political disagreements within Cabinet areof such magnitude that the Prime Minister finds it more expedient to set asidethe convention than to have the convention broken by members of Cabinet.Two illustrations of waiver can be given. In 1931–32, the National (coalition)government contained bitterly opposing views over economic policy; inparticular, over the levy of tariff duties. Four members of Cabinet handed intheir resignations, and withdrew them only after the Prime Minister, MrRamsey MacDonald, decided to waive the convention and allow the dissidentmembers to express their views publicly.
In 1975, the Labour government of Mr Harold Wilson was faced with an
equally intransigent faction in Cabinet on the matter of the United Kingdom’scontinued membership of the European Community. The government haddecided to put the question to the people in a referendum, although, inadvance of the referendum, the government announced that it would not bebound by the result.
Rather than face a public display of disunity in contravention of collective
responsibility, Mr Wilson announced a limited waiver of the convention, inthe guise of an ‘agreement to differ’:
2
... those ministers who do not agree with the government’s recommendation in
favour of continued membership of the European Community are, in theunique circumstances of the referendum, now free to advocate a different viewduring the referendum campaign.
This freedom does not extend to parliamentary proceedings and official
business ... At meetings of the Council of Ministers of the EuropeanCommunity and at other Community meetings, the United Kingdom positionin all fields will continue to reflect government policy.
I have asked all ministers ... not to allow themselves to appear in direct
confrontation, on the same platform or programme, with another minister whotakes a different view on the government recommendation.
In the event, one minister (Eric Heffer) flouted the limited waiver, and two
senior Cabinet members, Mr Roy Jenkins and Mr Tony Benn, opposed eachother in a public televised debate shortly before the referendum took place.
Cabinet papers3
The confidentiality of Cabinet discussion is protected by the prohibitionagainst disclosure by members of Cabinet. In addition, the rules regarding theconfidentiality of Cabinet papers include the rule that the government of the

day may not release the papers of a previous government without the consent
of the former Prime Minister.4Furthermore, the papers of the previous
government may not be disclosed to a government of a different politicalpersuasion. It may at first sight appear curious that an incoming governmentcannot gain access to the papers of the previous government, and it may bewondered how the government is supposed to act effectively in any policyarea if denied so much data. Nevertheless, the rule is justified on the basis thatan outgoing government might be tempted to remove politically sensitivedocumentation if it feared that a new government would make politicalcapital out of it. Three categories of papers are excepted from the convention:
5
(a) papers which, even if not publicly available, can be deemed to be in the
public domain, for example, letters sent by former ministers to tradeassociations, trade unions, etc, or to Members of Parliament aboutconstituency cases, or to members of the public;
(b) papers, other than genuinely personal messages, dealing with matters
which are known to foreign governments, for example, messages aboutinter-governmental negotiations;
(c) written opinions of the Law Officers, which are essentially legal rather
than political documents.
Ministerial memoirs
The publication of a former minister’s memoirs of his political life posesproblems for the rules relating to Cabinet secrecy. In 1976, the RadcliffeCommittee Report
6stated that:
The author should be free to use his ministerial experience for the purpose of
giving an account of his own work, subject to restrictions on three separatecategories of information:
(a) he must not reveal anything that contravenes the requirements of national
security operative at the time of his proposed publication;
(b) he must not make disclosures injurious to this country’s relations with
other nations;
(c) he must refrain from publishing information destructive of the confidential
relationships on which our system of government is based.
The final restriction relates to opinions or attitudes of Cabinet colleagues,
advice given to him by colleagues and criticism of those working for him inoffice.Chapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Responsible Government
In Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976), the issue of the publication of
the diaries of Richard Crossman, a former Labour Cabinet member, was
considered. Executors of the estate of Richard Crossman sought to publish hisDiaries; the government sought an injunction restraining publication.Recognising the convention of collective responsibility, Lord Widgery CJstated that:
I find overwhelming evidence that the doctrine of joint responsibility is
generally understood and practised, and equally strong evidence that it is onoccasion ignored. 
Having given such ambivalent recognition to the convention, which in any
event was not court-enforceable, the injunction was denied.
INDIVIDUAL MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY7
In Questions of Procedure for Ministers,8individual responsibility is defined as:
The minister in charge of a Department is alone answerable to Parliament for
the exercise of the powers on which the administration of the Departmentdepends. 
Ministerial responsibility for the department
The classic doctrine of this limb of ministerial responsibility states that a
minister is responsible for every action of his department. As AV Diceyexpressed it (1898), the responsibility of ministers means, where used in itsstrict sense, the legal responsibility of every minister for every act of theCrown in which he takes part.
Lord Morrison viewed the doctrine equally strictly:
... a minister is accountable to Parliament for anything he or his department
does or for anything he has powers to do, whether he does it or not. That is tosay, if the action or possible action is within the field of ministerial power orcompetence, the minister is answerable to Parliament [1964, p 265].
It is the minister who represents the public face of the department and who
speaks for the department in parliament. The doctrine is underpinned byParliamentary Question Time and in debates in parliament and in committees.During the passage of legislation relating to a particular department’sresponsibilities, it is the minister who will introduce the Bill and who willdefend the Bill throughout its passage through the House of Commons. Theminister thus stands as the link between the Civil Service and parliament,assuming full responsibility for the department. As seen in Chapter 10, the
3457 See Turpin, ‘Ministerial responsibility: myth or reality?’, in Jowell and Oliver, 1989,
Chapter 3.
8 Cabinet Office, 1992, revised 2001, para 33. See, also, Civil Servants and Ministers: Duties
and Responsibilities , Cmnd 9841, 1986, London: HMSO, para 11.

conventionally-recognised characteristics of the Civil Service are permanence,
political neutrality and anonymity. The civil servant owes his or her duty tothe government of the day, and is directly accountable to his or her Secretaryof State. The principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament not onlyunderpins the doctrine of democratic responsibility of ministers to the peoplethrough parliament, but also facilitates the distinction between theresponsibility of elected representatives and the civil servants who areresponsible for the practical implementation of policy. 
In practical terms nowadays, several factors diminish the extent to which a
minister can assume responsibility for every action of the department. Thesize of departments, the usually short ministerial tenure of office in any onedepartment and the complexity of modern government have long made thepure doctrine unworkable. As the Home Secretary, Mr Reginald Maudling,stated in 1973, the classic doctrine of responsibility must be viewed in the lightof modern conditions, with large departments of state. Furthermore, thecomplexity of defining the scope of ministerial responsibility must also beseen in light of the rapid and extensive administrative framework under thesystem of Next Steps agencies which are designed to increase efficiency inadministration by establishing specialist agencies, each with its own executive. 
Crichel Down
The classic doctrine was seen to operate most clearly in the Crichel Downaffair in 1954.
9Crichel Down, an area of some 725 acres in Dorset, had been
compulsorily acquired by the Air Ministry in 1937 for use as a bombing range.After the Second World War, the land was no longer needed and it wastransferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and administered by theAgriculture Land Commission. In 1950, the Commission decided that the bestway of disposing of the land was to equip it as a single farm unit and lease it.
Three hundred and twenty eight acres of Crichel Down had been part of
the Crichel Estates owned by a Mrs Marten. Her husband wanted to reclaimthe land. In both 1950 and 1952 he asked the Commission whether he couldbuy back the land. The Commission wrongly thought that they had no powerof sale and declined to investigate his request. Mr Marten raised the matterwith his Member of Parliament who referred the matter to the ParliamentarySecretary to the Minister of Agriculture who requested a report from the LandCommission. The official in charge of making the report was instructed not toapproach the previous owners or to inspect the land, and to treat the matter asone of great confidentiality. The resulting report was full of inaccuracies, andwent unchecked by the Ministry which decided to adhere to its original planfor the land.Chapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law
3469 Cmnd 9220, 1954, London: HMSO.

Responsible Government
Mr Marten was informed of the decision in 1953, and advised the Ministry
that he would rent the whole of the land. Meanwhile, the Ministry had
committed itself to another course of action. Mr Marten’s letters to theauthorities went unanswered and he pressed for a public inquiry. The inquiryfound that there had been inaccuracies in the report on the land, muddle andinefficiency in handling the matter and hostility to Mr Marten. In July 1954,the Minister Thomas Dugdale accepted responsibility and resigned.
10
Ministerial responsibility after Crichel Down
It is notable that, between 1954 and 1982, there were no instances ofministerial resignation following allegations of and inquiries into seriousdefects in departmental administration. In 1959, 52 people were killed bysecurity forces in Nyasaland but the Colonial Secretary Mr Lennox-Boyd didnot resign. In 1964, due to a lack of co-ordination within the Ministry ofAviation, an overpayment of some £4 million was made to the Ferranticompany, but the minister did not resign. In 1968, the Foreign Secretary, MrGeorge Brown, did not resign over the Sachsenhausen affair in which 12former detainees in a Nazi prison camp were wrongly denied compensationunder a scheme set up to compensate victims of Nazi persecution.
11
In 1971, the Vehicle and General Insurance Company collapsed leaving
over a million policy holders uninsured. The Department of Trade andIndustry had supervisory responsibility for insurance companies. An inquiryreport placed the blame on a civil servant, Mr Jardine, an Under Secretary inthe Department, and the minister did not resign.
12In 1982, the Home
Secretary, Mr William Whitelaw, did not resign over a breach of security atBuckingham Palace which resulted in an intruder entering the Queen’sbedroom, nor did Mr James Prior (as he then was), the Northern IrelandMinister, resign in 1984, following the escape of terrorists from the MazePrison. The exchange in parliament revealed divergent views aboutaccountability. In debate, Mr Prior distinguished carefully betweenresponsibility for policy – for which he accepted responsibility – and thefailure of officials to follow the correct orders and procedures – for which hedenied responsibility:
However, I do not accept – and I do not think it right for the House to accept –
that there is any constitutional or other principle that requires ministerialresignations in the face of failure, either by others to carry out orders orprocedures or by their supervisors to ensure that staff carried out those orders...

Mr Enoch Powell MP was of a different view:
What happened was an immense administrative disaster. It was not a disaster
in a peripheral area of the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Department.It was a disaster that occurred in an area which was quite clearly central to thedepartment’s responsibilities. If the responsibility for administration so centralto a department can be abjured by a minister, a great deal of our proceedingsin the House is a beating of the air because we are talking to people who, in thelast resort, disclaim the responsibility for the administration.
13
The Falklands War provided the scenario for three ministerial resignations.
Lord Carrington, the Foreign Secretary, resigned following allegations, whichhe denied, over the lack of preparation of the British forces when theArgentinians attacked; Mr Luce and Mr Atkins also resigned from the ForeignOffice.
14
In 1986 came the Westland Helicopter saga.15Westland, a helicopter
manufacturing company, was threatened with closure. The governmentsought to promote a rescue bid for the company. Two alternative plans wereput forward; one from an American consortium, the other from Europe. MrHeseltine, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, wanted the Europeanoption to be taken up. Mrs Thatcher, however, favoured the American plan.Mr Heseltine had been informed that he would be able to put his preferredplan to a Cabinet meeting. In the event, however, Mrs Thatcher cancelled thatmeeting. The conduct of the affair resulted in the resignations of Mr MichaelHeseltine, more on the basis of a breakdown in collective responsibility thanof individual responsibility, and of Mr Leon Brittan for the breach ofconvention in the leak of the Solicitor General’s letter.
In 1989, Mrs Edwina Currie resigned over the furore caused by her claim
that the majority of eggs in the United Kingdom were infected by thesalmonella virus and, in 1990, Mr Nicholas Ridley resigned from theDepartment of Trade and Industry, having accepted responsibility for makingintemperate remarks about a fellow Member State of the EuropeanCommunity.
In 1994, the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, faced several calls for his
resignation over escapes from Whitemore prison and over the finding ofescape equipment and weapons in prisons. Mr Howard refused to resign,citing in his support the precedent set by Mr James Prior (as he then was) overescapes from the Maze prison in Ulster, and the distinction betweenresponsibility for operational matters and matters of policy. In 2002, theSecretary of State for Transport, Stephen Byers, resigned. He had inherited adepartment which had ambitious plans for revitalisation of transport over aChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

ten year period. However, Byers seemed unable to produce progress in any
area and was perceived by many to be less than straightforward in accountingfor the department. He also, fatally, failed to dismiss his special adviser after acallous remark made on 11 September 2001. Increasingly his tenure becamedamaging to the government and Byers left office.
Evaluating the evidence
From the above evidence, how is the working of the doctrine of individualministerial responsibility to be evaluated? First, it is arguable that the doctrinerepresents one of the most significant conventions of the constitution,enhancing the accountability of the government to parliament and theelectorate. However, as has been seen above, the existence and acceptance ofresponsibility does not inevitably lead to the consequence of the resignation ofa minister for the failures within his department. No hard and fast rules existwhich will determine whether and when a minister should resign, andaccordingly it cannot clearly be said that resignation forms a part of theconvention itself. On the question of the circumstances under which a ministerwill resign as a result of departmental mismanagement, Professor SE Finer(1956) considered that:
... whether a minister is forced to resign depends on three factors: on himself,
his Prime Minister and his party. 
For a resignation to occur, all three factors have to be just so: the minister
compliant, the Prime Minister firm, the party clamorous. This conjuncture israre, and is in fact fortuitous. Above all, it is indiscriminate – which ministersescape and which do not is decided neither by the circumstances of the offencenor by its gravity.
Professor Finer went on to question whether in fact there is a ‘convention’ of
resignation at all, and concluded that the convention is so haphazard inoperation that it cannot amount to a rule.
16
THE MORALITY OF PUBLIC OFFICE
Qualification for ministerial office
Given the fundamental importance of ministerial responsibility, it is perhapssurprising that there are neither formal qualifications for office nor formalmeans by which the suitability for office is scrutinised in advance. Sir IvorJennings states that:
... the most elementary qualification demanded of a Minister is honesty and
incorruptibility. It is, however, necessary not only that he should possess thisqualification but also that he should appear to possess it. [1959a, Chapter V,p 106]
34916 See, also, Woodhouse, 1993.

Lord Hailsham expresses the same sentiment as follows:
A politician must be trustworthy, and if he is found out telling a lie or if he is
discovered in even a small financial dishonesty, he can only bow himself out ofpublic life [1975, p 199].
If a minister of the Crown or Member of Parliament conducts his personal or
financial affairs in such a manner that falls below an ‘acceptable standard’, theminister may be required to resign. Finer (1956) describes such conduct asbeing:
... a personal misadventure of the minister which raises such doubt about his
personal prudence or integrity as to cause him to resign.
INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL CONDUCT
Personal conduct
While responsibility for the implementation and execution of policy of course
entails ‘personal conduct’, one aspect of ministerial responsibility which hasalso given rise to particular concern is the conduct of ministers in relation totheir private lives. The personal relationships of ministers are also matterswhich fall under intense public scrutiny. In 1963, the Minister of Defence, MrJohn Profumo, was found to have been having a sexual relationship with aprostitute, Christine Keeler. Ms Keeler, it was found, also enjoyed a closepersonal relationship with a Russian Naval Attaché at the Soviet Embassy.When questioned in the House of Commons about the affair, Mr Profumo liedto the House. When the truth emerged, Mr Profumo resigned office. The causeof his resignation was not so much the sexual affair, but the contempt of theHouse committed through lying. The potential security aspects of the affairled to a judicial inquiry headed by Lord Denning MR.
17
In 1973, Lords Lambton and Jellicoe resigned office. Earl Jellicoe, Lord
Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, resigned after it had beenrevealed that he had been associating with prostitutes. Lord Lambton,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence for the Royal Air Force,resigned over allegations of involvement with illegal drugs. The governmentrequested an inquiry by the Security Commission into any security aspects ofthe affairs, which resulted in the finding that no classified information had infact been revealed either directly or indirectly to ‘any potentially hostilepower’.
18
In 1983, Cecil Parkinson MP, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
and Conservative Party Chairman, resigned following revelations about aChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

long standing relationship with his secretary, Sarah Keays, who became
pregnant. For some time, the Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, and the Partymaintained their support for Mr Parkinson,
19as did his wife throughout the
public attention focused on the affair. When Sarah Keays published a series ofarticles in the national press about the matter, and alleged that Mr Parkinsonhad said that he wanted to marry her, public and political support began towane, and Mr Parkinson resigned.
In 1992, Alan Amos MP resigned after allegations of indecency with
another man. Also in 1992, the Heritage Secretary David Mellor was forced toresign following revelations of a sexual relationship with an actress (and thereceipt of gifts). The majority of the revelations had been brought aboutthrough the illicit bugging of an apartment used by Mr Mellor. While thisaffair alone may not have caused his downfall, the revelation that Mr Mellorand his family had enjoyed the hospitality, while on holiday, of the wife of aPalestinian Liberation Organisation official, sealed his fate. Despite beingregarded as an excellent Heritage Secretary, the intense and hostile coverageby the media ensured his resignation.
20In January 1994, Tim Yeo MP,
Minister of State for the Environment, resigned after admitting fathering achild out of wedlock, as did Alan Duncan MP after allegations that he hadused the ‘right to buy’ legislation to make money in property deals with aneighbour. In February 1994, Hartley Booth MP resigned after a ‘closerelationship’ with a research assistant; in May 1994, Michael Brown MPresigned following newspaper reports of a ‘friendship’ with a male civilservant. In 1998, Ron Davies, the Welsh Secretary, resigned immediately afterbeing discovered in still unexplained but curious circumstances on ClaphamCommon. The message is, if you are caught out resign sooner rather than laterin order to spare the government embarrassment and loss of publicconfidence.
Financial probity
The personal financial probity of ministers, their Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries and other Members of Parliament is regarded with seriousness.Under the law and custom of parliament, Members must declare theirfinancial interests in the Register of Members’ Interests and make publicdeclarations in debate or committee proceedings of any interests they holdwhich may affect their impartiality.
21The holding of directorships, ownership
of shares, consultancy positions and receipt of gifts all raise issues concerningintegrity and fitness for office. Ministers of the Crown must give up anypublic appointments or directorships on assuming office. Further, they must

divest themselves of any financial interests on assuming office where that
interest might give rise to conflict with his or her ministerial responsibilities.22
The Ministerial Code23states that ‘Ministers must ensure that no conflict
arises, or appears to arise, between their public duties and their privateinterests, financial or otherwise’. There is an inherent vagueness in suchcriteria, yet relatively few ministers and other Members of Parliament havefallen from grace as a result of imprudent (or dishonest) financial dealings. In1913, the issue of ministers holding shares was raised in debate followingallegations of improper ministerial involvement in the Marconi Company.
24It
was rumoured that ministers25had used information received as ministers for
their own personal advantage. All three ministers involved denied any sharedealings. A select committee inquiry exonerated the ministers of all charges ofcorruption and from charges that they had used their ministerial positions forpersonal gain. 
In 1949, a Tribunal of Inquiry
26was established to inquire into allegations
of payments and other benefits being made to John Belcher MP, ParliamentarySecretary to the Board of Trade. Mr Belcher had received gifts offered with aview to securing favourable treatment in relation to licences granted by theBoard of Trade. He resigned office and his parliamentary seat as a result.

Recent ministerial resignations involving allegations of financial
imprudence – although in each case there were additional factors involved inthe resignations – include, as noted above, p 351, David Mellor, the HeritageSecretary, who resigned following a mixture of allegations, one of whichinvolved the receipt of a free holiday from a woman with PalestinianLiberation Organisation associations.
28In 1992, it was revealed that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, had received £4,700 of publicmoney for legal fees involved in the eviction of a tenant from his apartment.

In June 1993, the Minister for Northern Ireland, Michael Mates MP, resignedoffice after it had been revealed that Mr Mates gave to the fugitivebusinessman Asil Nadir, who faces prosecution on charges of theft and fraud,an inexpensive watch, shortly before Mr Nadir fled the United Kingdom. ThePrime Minister described the gift as ‘an error of judgment’ and ‘not a hangingmatter’. The matter might have been allowed to rest if it were not for thesubsequent allegation that Mr Mates accepted the loan of a car from Mr NadirChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

for his ex-wife’s use, and that Mr Mates had dined with Mr Nadir shortly
before he left the country. Mr Mates30claimed to have the full support of the
Prime Minister and said that he would not resign over the matter:nevertheless, he ultimately resigned. Further embarrassment was caused tothe government in 1994, when it was alleged that Jeffrey Archer, formerConservative Party Chairman, had been involved in share-dealing in AngliaTelevision, on whose Board of Directors his wife held a directorship. In 1994,allegations were made that Members of Parliament had accepted payment forasking parliamentary questions. This affair escalated into a full-scale judicialinquiry into ‘standards in public life’, and to a tightening of the rulesregulating the financial interests of all members of the House of Commons.
Premature disclosure of confidential information
In 1936, the Colonial Secretary, JH Thomas, resigned after revealinginformation relating to Budget proposals before they had been announced inparliament. As a consequence, two friends, Alfred Bates and Sir Alfred ButtMP, made financial gains. A ‘leak’ of information was suspected and aTribunal of Inquiry was established. The Prime Minister described Thomas’sconduct as ‘letting his tongue wag when he was in his cups’.
31The Attorney
General refused to prosecute under the Official Secrets Act, and the ministerresigned. In 1947, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Hugh Dalton, resignedafter revealing Budget proposals to a journalist.
Nowadays, the contents of the Budget are regarded as being far less secret,
and it is not uncommon for the Chancellor to discuss proposals publicly priorto revealing the precise details to parliament. Nevertheless, the convention ofsecrecy of the Budget is such that the exact proposals need not be, and are not,revealed even to the Cabinet before being disclosed in parliament.
The Nolan Committee
The result of continued and intensive media interest in ministerial conducthas caused a loss of public confidence in Members of Parliament as a whole,and in the conduct and probity of ministers. The Nolan Committee, appointedto inquire into standards in public life, examined in general the standards ofconduct expected of ministers. More specifically, the Committee hasinvestigated the question of the rules relating to ministers who retire fromoffice and subsequently take up employment with organisations with whomthey had dealings whilst in ministerial office. In addition, the Committeeconsidered the organisation, regulation and personnel employed in non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs or ‘quangos’).

The conduct of ministers of the Crown
The Nolan Committee endorsed the view that the ‘public is entitled to expect
very high standards of behaviour from ministers, as they have profoundinfluence over the daily lives of us all’.
33The Committee distinguished
between the need for clear enforceable rules regulating financial conduct andthose regulating sexual conduct. In respect of the latter, the Committee, whilstrecognising that sexual improprieties may on occasion be relevant to theperformance of a minister’s public duties, took the view that it was notpossible to lay down hard and fast rules to regulate such private conduct.
In respect to financial matters, however, the Committee took a very
different view. The Committee recommended that Questions of Procedure for
Ministers,
34the document issued by the Prime Minister for the regulation of
public conduct, should be redrafted and the rules relating to ministers moreclearly and forcefully expressed. Questions of Procedure, while having no
formal constitutional status, is nevertheless, in practice, binding on allmembers of the government (Nolan Report, paragraph 9). The Committeerecommended that the Prime Minister should be given explicit power todetermine whether ministers – who are responsible for complying with thestandards of conduct – have in fact upheld the required standard (paragraph13).
As discussed in Chapter 18, the appointment of a Commissioner for
Standards, as recommended by the Nolan Committee, the refashioning of theCommittee of Privileges as the Committee on Standards and Privileges andthe renewed emphasis on the duty to formally register interests, has resultedin a tightening of parliamentary scrutiny of, and control over, ministerialconduct. In 1997, the Commissioner ruled that the former Chancellor of theExchequer should have registered his sponsored attendance at a conference inGreece. One early inquiry also undertaken by the Commissioner, Sir GordonDowney, was into allegations that the Labour Party had accepted, during theelection campaign, a donation of over £1 million from the head of FormulaOne racing. Controversy heightened when, subsequent to the election, thegovernment exempted Formula One from the proposed ban on the tobaccoindustry sponsoring sporting events. Following some delay, the money wasreturned. The Commissioner has also examined allegations concerning thePaymaster General, Geoffrey Robinson, who, it was alleged, failed to registerhis substantial interests in offshore trusts. While the Commissioner wascritical of Robinson’s failure to register, Sir Gordon Downey and theCommittee on Standards and Privileges cleared him of breaking any House ofCommons rules. The Commissioner stated that in future, where there wasdoubt as the requirement of registration, the advice of the CommissionerChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

should be sought.35Nineteen ninety-eight saw the culmination of the long
running inquiry into the financial affairs of the former Paymaster General,
Geoffrey Robinson, when in December both Robinson and Peter Mandelson,Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, resigned. Peter Mandelson had beena leading architect in making the Labour Party ‘electable’ and a pivotal figureis the general election campaign. However, it was revealed that Mandelsonhad accepted a personal loan from Robinson to finance the purchase of aLondon home, and that the loan had not been disclosed. While protesting thathe had done nothing ‘wrong’, Mandelson resigned. He returned to ministerialoffice in 1999 as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, only to resign againover allegations that he interfered in a passport application of a wealthyIndian businessman who had contributed money to the Millennium Dome forwhich Mandelson had responsibility at the time.
The Scott Report and ministerial responsibility
The Arms to Iraq affair, discussed in Chapter 10, resulted in the Scott Reportand to an in-depth analysis of ministerial responsibility by Sir Richard Scott,the Inquiry chairman. On the question of giving a full and honest account ofpolicy matters to parliament, Sir Richard endorsed the proposals made inNolan LJ’s First Report,
36 recommending amendments to Questions of Procedure
for Ministers to emphasise that ‘Ministers must not knowingly mislead
parliament and the public ... They must be as open as possible withparliament and the public, withholding information only when disclosurewould not be in the public interest’. In his report, Sir Richard Scott stated that‘the withholding of information by an accountable minister should never bebased on reasons of convenience or for the avoidance of politicalembarrassment, but should always require special and carefully consideredjustification’.
37
In ‘Ministerial accountability’ (1996),Sir Richard Scott developed the
themes analysed by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe in his report on the Crichel Downaffair (see above, p 346), and evidence given to the Scott Inquiry by Sir RobinButler, the Cabinet Secretary. Referring to the distinction increasinglyfrequently made in recent years between ministerial constitutionalresponsibility and ministerial constitutional accountability, Sir Richard Scottcited Sir Robin’s evidence as follows:
I am using ‘accountability’ to mean that the Minister must always answer
questions and give an account to Parliament for the action of his department,whether he is ‘responsible’ in the sense of attracting personal criticism himself,or not. So I am using ‘accountability’ to leave out, as it were, the blame element
35535 (1998) The Times , 21 January.
36 Nolan Report, on which, see, further, Chapter 18.
37 Scott Report, para K8.5.

of it. The blame element is an open question. There are cases where he is
accountable in which he may be personally blameworthy, and there will beoccasions when he is not personally blameworthy.
38
The ‘divorce’ between the acceptance of responsibility and the consequence of
resignation is not, in Sir Richard’s expressed view, the ‘heart of an effectivesystem of parliamentary accountability’ as the Treasury and Civil ServiceSelect Committee regarded it to be.
39In Sir Richard’s view, what does lie at
the heart of the constitutional doctrine is rather the: 
... obligation of ministers to give, or to facilitate the giving, of information
about the activities of their departments and about the actions and omission oftheir civil servants.
40
This obligation to provide information came into conflict in relation to defence
sales with the government’s insistence on following the practice of notdisclosing to parliament information concerning individual export licensingmatters, a practice which did not, in Sir Richard’s view, constitute anydeparture from the practice adopted by all other post-War administrations.However, in 1991, the British government supported the introduction by theUnited Nations of a voluntary register identifying the movement of, andquantities of, conventional weaponry between supplier and recipient nations.On this basis, Sir Richard Scott called for an abandonment of the blanketrefusal to answer parliamentary questions, at least in relation to conventionalweaponry.
The refusal to answer questions at all is but part of the problem of the duty
to give information. A further cause for concern lay in the failure of ministersto give full answers to questions and, in relation to the Scott Inquiry, in thefailure of witnesses to provide the full picture. ‘Commercial confidentiality’ isan accepted reason for the denial of information, but that, in Sir Richard’sview, did not excuse the refusal of information or the provision of informationabout weapons supply. National security is another justified exception to theduty to make full disclosure. Nevertheless:
... setting those rare cases aside, the proposition that it is acceptable for a
Minister to give an answer that is deliberately incomplete is one which, in myopinion, is inconsistent with the requirements of the constitutional principle ofministerial accountability. Half the picture can be true ... But the audience doesnot know that it is seeing only half the picture. If it did know, it wouldprotest.
41
A strong democracy can only be a legitimate label if the electors are able to
express their view on the basis of adequate knowledge of governmentactivities:Chapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Responsible Government
A failure by Ministers to meet the obligations of ministerial accountability by
providing information about the activities of their departments engenderscynicism about government and undermines, in my opinion, the democraticprocess.
42
Sir Richard Scott’s recommendations
Sir Richard called for the appointment a parliamentary officer, independent of
the executive, charged with the task of scrutinising claims by ministers thatinformation should not be revealed ‘in the public interest’. Such an officerwould require free access to government documents and would report toparliament twice yearly. In addition, parliament needed to tighten up on therules requiring witnesses to give evidence by a more robust use of the conceptof contempt of parliament. 
Moreover, Sir Richard called for a ‘comprehensive review’ of the subjects
on which governments refuse to answer questions, and of the obligation ofministers ‘to provide and facilitate the provision of information to selectcommittees’.
43This task was been undertaken by the Public Service
Committee which reported in July 1996. 
The Public Service Committee report: ministerial accountability
and responsibility44
Reviewing the doctrine of ministerial responsibility from the Crichel Down
affair in 1954 to the current time, the Committee produced 34 conclusions and
recommendations. In the Committee’s view, it was not possible to distinguishabsolutely between areas in which a minister is personally responsible (andblameworthy) and areas in which the minister is constitutionallyaccountable.
45Further, the Committee concluded that ‘proper and rigorous
scrutiny and accountability’ is the more important feature of ministerialresponsibility than is parliament’s ability to force that minister’s resignation.
The government’s response
In Government Response to the Report ,46the government accepted the
Committee’s view on the difficulty of a clear distinction betweenresponsibility and accountability but, nevertheless, agreed that the distinction

was one which, in some circumstances, remained useful. The government also
accepted that ministers must account to parliament for their, and theirdepartment’s actions, and must respond to criticisms made in parliament.Further, the government accepted that parliament had the right to determinewhether to impose and what sanctions were to be imposed on ministers.
The Public Service Committee had been critical of the fact that the
definition and scope of ministerial responsibility was formulated by thegovernment of the day, via Question of Procedures for Ministers , rather than by
parliament, which alone had the right to demand and enforce ministerialresponsibility. As a result, and after much inter-Party debate, the Houseresolved in 1997 that:
In the opinion of the House, the following principles should govern the
conduct of ministers of the Crown in relation to Parliament:
(1) Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for
the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and next step
agencies;
(2) It is of paramount importance that ministers should give accurate and
truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at theearliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will beexpected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister;
(3) Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to
provide information only when disclosure would not be in the publicinterest;
(4) Ministers should require civil servants who give evidence before
parliamentary committees on their behalf and under their directions to beas helpful as possible in providing accurate, truthful and full information;
(5) The interpretation of ‘public interest’ in paragraph (3) shall be decided in
accordance with statute and the government’s Code of Practice on Accessto Government Information ...; and compliance with the duty inparagraph (4) shall be in accordance with the duties and responsibilities ofcivil services set out in the Civil Service Code ...

Vetting of prospective ministers?
In the United States of America, appointment to Cabinet office is undertaken
only after the ‘advice and consent’ of the Senate has been obtained.48By this
means, it is intended to test the suitability of candidates prior to appointmentand to avoid the inevitable embarrassment which occurs when resignation isforced through disclosure of some financial, sexual or other impropriety. Inthe United Kingdom, by contrast, appointment is entirely at the discretion ofthe Prime Minister and will be made on information which is publiclyChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

available and from the personal and political reputation of the candidate. As
has been seen above, the standard of conduct required for public life and thereality frequently part company. It is thus at least arguable that some form of‘vetting’ – such as occurs with prospective holders of senior Civil Service posts– should be introduced. Professor Rodney Brazier has advocated this course ofaction,
49favouring some form of pre-appointment formal inquiry into fitness
for office. Such an approach has not found favour with others who haveconsidered it. In the inquiry following the Profumo scandal, Lord Denningstated that there should be no inquiry into politicians’ private lives by theSecurity Service other than where state security was under threat, a viewendorsed by the Security Commission in its report following the resignationsof Lords Lambton and Jellicoe.
50Lord Hailsham has expressed the view that,
in a democracy, there should be no such invasive advance inquiries into theprivate lives of public figures (1975) while recognising the real risks ofcorruption in public life which ‘is hard to define ... harder to detect, andalmost as catching as smallpox’ (p 201). It must, however, be conceded thatwhen the standard of conduct is lowered and the esteem of a governmentdamaged by lack of integrity, then some action is needed. 
GOVERNMENT OPENNESS AND GOVERNMENT SECRECY
The issue of the confidentiality of Cabinet papers has been discussed above,pp 343–44. More generally, the issue of confidentiality of government papersgives rise to questions about the extent to which the government in the UnitedKingdom operates with an unnecessary degree of secrecy. Secrecy ingovernment raises important questions for the individual citizen over theright of access to personal information stored by the government and also tothe right of access of citizens more generally to documents concerninggovernment of the state and of access to information about the policies andstandards of service of public bodies. The issue of access to personal data heldby government is discussed later in this chapter. A further question arises asto the disclosure of government documents to courts of law and the use ofpublic interest immunity certificates by the government to conceal evidence.

STANDARDS OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
THE OPENNESS OF GOVERNMENT
Access to information51
The balance to be struck between the right of authorities to maintain
confidential records and the right of individuals to access to that informationis increasingly a matter of concern. There is no general right of access to datastored by the state, for example, records maintained by the Police, InlandRevenue, National Health Service and Department of Social Security. Underthe Official Secrets Act 1989, categories of information can never be disclosed.A limited right of access to personal files is granted under the Data ProtectionAct 1984.
52Citizens in the United Kingdom are entitled to access to official
records in certain categories of cases.53The information which can be
disclosed is currently confined to computerised records, and not to manuallycreated files, although access to these will be introduced in the future.
In any heavily regulated state, government departments will have access
to large amounts of personal data on its citizens. Tax authorities, SocialSecurity offices, local authorities and driving licence authorities are but fourmajor holders of personal information. The individual has two interests inpersonal records. The first is that information held about the individualshould be accessible to him or her. The second is that the individual should beprotected against disclosure of such personal data to third parties. 
The protection of personal data
A range of statutes prohibit the unauthorised disclosure of personal data tothird parties. Local authority records (relating to, inter alia , adoption,
education, child support, housing, medical records and social security) areprotected. Equally, in the financial industry, there is protection given toconfidential information. In relation to such information, the government doesnot accept that there is a need to relax the restrictions on disclosure. 
Access to personal data
The Data Protection Act 1984 provided that computer-held personalinformation should be made available to individuals, in order that the personconcerned may check the accuracy of the data. The Data Protection Act 1998replaces and repeals the 1984 Act. The Act only applies to personal data,defined in section 1(1), and confers the right to be informed of whether data isChapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law

being held and to have that data communicated to the subject. The data
covered by the Act is wider than under the 1984 Act and relates both tocomputer held records and manual files. Disclosure may be refused where itwould, inter alia , damage national security, be in the interests of the
prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution ofoffenders (sections 28 and 29). A Data Protection Commissioner supervisesthe operation of the Act, and may issue enforcement notices on any datacontroller who is not acting in accordance with the principles of the Act (seesection 4 and Schedule 1). The Commissioner lays an annual report beforeparliament. The Access to Personal Files Act 1987 provides that individualshave the right to inspect records relating to social services and housingtenancies. Medical records prepared for insurance or employment purposesare accessible under the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988. The Access toHealth Records Act 1990 gives patients the right to see records held by generalpractitioners, health authorities or NHS trusts. 
Access to public records
The Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967 provide for the inspection of publicrecords at the Public Records Office after 30 years, unless there is justificationfor withholding them. The Lord Chancellor also has the power under the Actto order the release of documents at an earlier period if in the public interest.Under section 5 of the 1958 Act, records may be kept closed for a longerperiod.
54The main classes of information not disclosed relate to population
census returns, Ministry of Pensions First World War war pensions awardsfiles and the Inland Revenue Stamps and Taxes Division registered files.
The Freedom of Information Act 2000
In 1997, the incoming Labour government promised to inject greater opennessinto the machinery of government. Towards this end, a White Paper, Your
Right to Know: White Paper on Freedom of Information, was published in
December 1997.
55The government intended that, for the first time, citizens
should have a legal right to information and to the records in which thatinformation is contained. In addition, an independent InformationCommissioner will be appointed, who will be answerable not to parliament,but to the courts. The new legal right applies throughout the public sector, aswell as to some private organisations carrying out duties on behalf ofgovernment and privatised utilities. Citizens are entitled to information,subject to ‘harm tests’. The Freedom of Information Act supersedes the Code

of Practice on Access to Government Information and amends the Data
Protection Act 1998 and the Public Records Act 1958. The Act will be fullyimplemented by 2005, and applies to central government with effect fromNovember 2002. The Act is the culmination of years of attempting to open upthe processes of government. There are, however, a number of restrictionsimposed on the right to information.
The Freedom of Information Act for the first time confers on citizens a
general right of access to data held by public authorities (section 1), includinglocal government, National Health Service bodies, schools and colleges, thepolice and others. Requests must be in writing, and the authority is under aduty to respond to the request within 20 working days of its receipt. A fee ispayable and the duty to disclose does not arise until the fee is paid. The Act isregulated by a Commissioner to whom the public has a right of direct access(section 18; see, further, below). A public authority may decline to provideinformation where the cost exceeds the ‘appropriate limit’ (section 11; thelimits are prescribed and may be changed). The Act also provides a list ofexempted information, which considerably weakens the general principle of a‘right to know’.
Information which is exempt from disclosure is in two categories: that
which is absolutely exempt and other information which requires thebalancing of the public interest in maintaining the exemption and the publicinterest in disclosure. The following categories of information are exemptfrom the duty of disclosure (Part II of the Act):
• information which is accessible by other means or which is to be
published;
• information relating to the security services or the royal household;
• personal information or information provided to the authority in
confidence;
• information to which professional privilege applies;
• information which might prejudice:
• national security; defence or the effectiveness of the armed forces;• international relations or relations between administrations within the
United Kingdom;
• the country’s economic interests;• criminal investigations or proceedings;• law enforcement;• the effective conduct of public affairs;
• the physical or mental health of any person;
• trade secrets or commercial interests.Chapter 11: Constitutional and Administrative Law
362

Responsible Government
The Act specifies the investigative and enforcement powers of the
Commissioner. Where the Commissioner decides that a public authority hasfailed to communicate information, or to provide confirmation or denial, in acase where it is required to do so, the Commissioner may issue a decisionnotice specifying the steps which must be taken by the authority in order tocomply (section 49(4)). The Commissioner may also issue enforcement noticesrequiring the authority to take, within a specified time, such steps as requiredto comply. Where the Commissioner has issued a decision or enforcementnotice in respect of the disclosure of information under section 13, a certificatemay be issued by an ‘accountable person’ as defined in the Act, the effect ofthis is that a public authority need not comply with the Commissioner’s notice(section 52). If an authority fails to comply with the Commissioner’s notice,the Commissioner may so certify to the High Court or, in Scotland, the Courtof Session, and the court may, having conducted a hearing, deal with theauthority as if it had committed a contempt of court (section 53).
Appeals
Either the complainant or the pubic authority may appeal against a decisionnotice to the Tribunal under section 56. The Tribunal shall either allow theappeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by theCommissioner and, in other cases, must dismiss the appeal. Appeals from thedecision of the Tribunal on a point of law lie to the High Court or to the Courtof Session in relation to Scotland and to the High Court of Justice in NorthernIreland.
Amendments relating to public records
Part VI of the Act provides a statutory regime for access to public records,replacing the provisions of the Public Records Act 1958 relating todiscretionary disclosure. It also provides for increased access to informationcontained in records more than 30 years old. 
Amendments to the Data Protection Act 1998 
Part VII extends the Data Protection Act 1998 in relation to subject access anddata accuracy on information held by public authorities. Schedule 6 extendsthe 1998 Act to include relevant personal information processed by or onbehalf of both Houses of Parliament. Personal data is, however, exempt if theexemption is required for the purpose of avoiding an infringement of theprivileges of either House of Parliament.

CHAPTER 12
PART I – REGIONAL GOVERNMENT: 
THE DEVOLUTION OF POWER
As discussed in Chapters 1 to 3, the constitution of the United Kingdom has
traditionally been characterised by the unity of its several parts, withcentralised government. Wales became united with England through beingconquered in 1262, while the Acts of Union 1706 and 1707 marked the end ofthe separation of Scotland and England under two sovereign parliaments.Despite the former attempt at devolution of power to both Wales andScotland in 1978, discussed in Chapter 3, the population of neither countrythen expressed – according to the terms of the referendum – the desire forgreater separation from centralised government. Two decades later, however,the political position is much changed. A disenchantment with the extent towhich the national parliament reflected the views of the people of Scotland, inparticular, and Wales, and a rising tide of nationalist regional sentiment, hasled to change and power being devolved from the centre to the nations. Inaddition, settlement reached in Northern Ireland under the 1998 Good Fridayagreement facilitated the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
NORTHERN IRELAND
The Northern Ireland Act 1998 regulates the Northern Ireland Assembly andExecutive. The Act includes many significant distinguishing features uniqueto the situation pertaining in Northern Ireland. In particular, the Act providesfor a power sharing executive, with offices allocated between differingpolitical parties according to their electoral support. As discussed in moredetail below, the Assembly is given statutory power to exclude a minister orjunior minister, or a political party, from holding office for a 12 month periodif the Assembly resolves that he, she or it no longer enjoys the confidence ofthe Assembly on the basis that he or she is not committed to non-violence andexclusively peaceful and democratic means. The Act also provides for theprotection of all citizens of Northern Ireland from discrimination on thegrounds of religious belief and introduces a Human Rights Commission andEqual Opportunities Commission.

365REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
1 The Act repeals, inter alia , in full, the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Northern Ireland
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, Northern Ireland Assembly Act 1973, Northern
Ireland Constitution (Amendment) Act 1973, Northern Ireland Act 1974, and, in part,the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and all of the Northern Ireland Act 1982and the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998. 

The completion of the devolution of power to the new Assembly was
conditional upon the decommissioning of weaponry by the paramilitary
organisations, under the terms of the Belfast Agreement of 1998. As a result ofthe failure of the IRA to decommission its arms, power reverted to the UnitedKingdom Parliament under the Northern Ireland Act 2000. Following furthernegotiations on the arms issue, power was once again transferred to theNorthern Ireland Assembly and Executive. During the brief period ofsuspension, the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended and no Acts couldbe passed by the Assembly, nor could the Assembly or any Committee holdmeetings or conduct any business during the period of revocation. Ministersand chairpersons of statutory committees did not hold office during therevocation period. The functions of the North-South Ministerial Council andthe British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference were not to be exercised.Following suspension, the Secretary of State had a statutory duty to initiate areview of the situation as required under the Belfast Agreement. The Secretaryof State ended suspension through the making of a restoration order, takinginto account the result of the review. When a restoration order is made, thepersons holding office as First Minister and Deputy First Minister, andministers or junior ministers and chairpersons of statutory committees, remaineligible to hold office and resume office on the effective date. If a restorationorder is revoked by the Secretary of State, section 1 of the Northern IrelandAct 2000 comes into force once again.
2The Secretary of State’s powers are
exercisable by statutory instrument.3While a suspension order is in effect, the
functions of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are exercisable by theSecretary of State, and the functions of Northern Ireland Ministers areexercised by a Northern Ireland Department. 
The status of Northern Ireland
Section 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 reiterates earlier pledges regardingthe status of Northern Ireland, stating that:
... Northern Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom and
shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people ofNorthern Ireland voting in a poll held for the purposes of this section ...
Giving recognition to long held Republican ambitions, section 1 commits the
government of the United Kingdom to give effect to the wishes of the peopleshould a majority express the wish to cease to be part of the United Kingdomand form part of a united Ireland, following such agreement as may be madebetween the United Kingdom government and the government of Ireland.

Assembly elected the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Each candidate
for the post of First Minister and Deputy First Minister must stand for electionjointly with the other candidate, and the two candidates must be elected by amajority of members voting in the election, requiring a majority of designatedNationalists voting and a majority of designated Unionists voting. If either theFirst Minister or Deputy First Minister resigns or otherwise ceases to holdoffice, the other minister shall also cease to hold office at that time, but maycontinue in office until a new election is held.
4The leader of the Ulster
Unionists, David Trimble became First Minister and Seamus Mallon, theSocial Democratic and Labour Party’s (SDLP) deputy leader became DeputyFirst Minister. 
Ministerial offices
The number of ministerial offices is determined by the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister acting jointly, but may not exceed ten, or such greaternumber as is approved by the Secretary of State. The allocation of ministerialoffices provided for under the Act is one designed to achieve power sharingbetween the political parties, in proportion to the number of seats held in theAssembly. The formula, the ‘d’Hondt system’ devised by the eighteenthcentury Belgian political scientist, is the number of seats in the Assembly heldby members of the party on the day the Assembly first met following itselection, divided by the number of ministerial offices (if any) held by membersof the party, plus one. Where this results in the same total for two parties, theparty with the bigger number of first preference votes in the Assemblyelections has the first choice of offices.
5An Executive Committee is
established, comprising the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and theNorthern Ireland Ministers. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister arechairmen of the Committee.

Ministers or Northern Ireland Departments have no power to make,
confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or do any act, so far as thelegislation or act is incompatible with Convention rights or Community law,or discriminates against, or aids or incites another person to discriminateagainst, a person or class of person on the ground of religious belief orpolitical opinion.
7If any subordinate legislation made, confirmed or approved
by a minister or Northern Ireland Department contains provisions dealingwith excepted or reserved matters, the Secretary of State may revoke thelegislation.

Any subordinate legislation made whichconflicts with the above interests may be revoked by the Secretary of State.

Elections10
Assembly elections are held every four years. Provision is made forextraordinary elections, whereby, if the Assembly passes a resolution that itshould be dissolved, the Secretary of State must propose a date for the electionof the next Assembly. Constituencies are those for parliamentary elections andeach constituency returns six members. Voting is by single transferable vote,defined as being a vote:
(a) capable of being given so as to indicate the voter’s order of preference for
the candidates for election as members for the constituency; and
(b) capable of being transferred to the next choice when the vote is not needed
to give a prior choice the necessary quota of votes or when a prior choice is
eliminated from the list of candidates because of a deficiency in thenumber of votes given for him. 
The Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act 1975 regulates eligibilityfor membership, and a person claiming that a person purporting to be amember of the Assembly is disqualified may apply to the High Court ofJustice in Northern Ireland for a declaration to that effect.
The Assembly
The first task of the elected Assembly was to elect from among its members aPresiding Officer and deputies, positions analogous to the Speaker of theHouse of Commons and his or her deputy.
11Consistent also with the Scotland
Act 1998, there is established a corporate body, known as the Northern IrelandAssembly Commission, comprising the Presiding Officer and members of theAssembly, to perform the functions of providing property, staff and services,and other contractual functions. 
As noted earlier, the Assembly has the power to exclude a minister or
junior minister, or a political party, from the Assembly if that minister or partydoes not enjoy the confidence of the Assembly. The Assembly may resolveChapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

that a person or party no longer enjoys its confidence on the basis that the
person or party is not committed to non-violence and exclusively peaceful anddemocratic means; or because of any failure to observe any other terms of thepledge of office. If a resolution is passed, the Assembly may exclude thatperson or party from the Assembly or members of the political party may beexcluded from holding office as ministers or junior ministers for a period of 12months, which may be extended for a further period of 12 months. A motionfor a resolution shall not be moved unless it is supported by at least 30members of the Assembly, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister actingjointly, or by the Presiding Officer. If the Secretary of State is of the opinionthat the Assembly ought to consider such a resolution, he may serve a noticeon the Presiding Officer requiring him to move a motion for the resolution. Informing an opinion, the Secretary of State must take into account whether theminister or party:
(a) is committed to the use now and in the future of only democratic and
peaceful means to achieve his, her or its objectives;
(b) has ceased to be involved in any acts of violence or of preparation for
violence;
(c) is directing or promoting acts of violence by other persons;(d) is co-operating fully with any Commission involved in decommissioning.
A resolution under section 30 ‘shall not be passed without cross-community
support’.
Legislation
The Northern Ireland Act 1998, section 5 provides for the making of Acts ofthe Assembly, but reserves for the United Kingdom Parliament the right tomake laws for Northern Ireland, subject to the right of the Assembly tomodify provisions made by Act of Parliament in so far as it is part of the lawof Northern Ireland. The legislative competence of the Assembly is regulatedby sections 6 and 7, and section 6(1) states that a provision of an Act is not lawif it is outside the legislative competence of the Assembly. Provisions definedas outside legislative competence include those forming part of the law of acountry or territory other than Northern Ireland, matters which are exceptedand not ancillary to other provisions dealing with reserved or transferredmatters,
12provisions incompatible with Convention rights or Community
law, matters discriminating against any person or class of person on theground of religious belief or political opinion. The minister in charge of theBill shall make a statement to the effect that the Bill is within the legislativecompetence of the Assembly.
13In addition, if the Presiding Officer decides
that any provision of a Bill would not be within the legislative competence of

the Assembly, that Bill is not to be introduced. The Presiding Officer must
consider a Bill both on its introduction and before the Assembly reaches itsfinal legislative stage, and if he considers that any provision is outside theAssembly’s competence, he shall refer it to the Secretary of State and theAssembly shall not proceed with the Bill. Under section 12, the AttorneyGeneral for Northern Ireland may refer a Bill to the Judicial Committee of thePrivy Council for a ruling as to whether a provision is within the legislativecompetence of the Assembly, and the Judicial Committee may refer a questionfor a preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice. Where such areference is made, and the reference has not been disposed of, the Assemblymay resolve to reconsider the Bill and the Presiding Officer must notify theAttorney General and the Attorney General request the withdrawal of thereference. Bills shall not be submitted for the royal assent at any time whenthe Attorney General is entitled to make a reference under section 11 or such areference has been made but not decided by the Judicial Committee, or if theJudicial Committee has decided that any provision of a Bill is not within thelegislative competence of the Assembly or a reference made has beenwithdrawn. If the Secretary of State considers that a Bill contains provisionswhich are incompatible with international obligations, the interests of defenceor national security or the protection of public safety or public order, or wouldhave an adverse effect on the operation of the single market within the UnitedKingdom, he may decide not to submit the Bill for royal assent.

Resolving devolution issues
Schedule 10 defines and regulates proceedings in relation to devolutionissues. A devolution issue is one relating to the legislative competence of theAssembly, whether the purported or proposed exercise of a function would beinvalid by virtue of section 24 (discussed above), failures to comply withConvention rights or Community law or questions relating to excepted orreserved matters. In relation to proceedings in Northern Ireland, these may beinitiated or defended by the Attorney General or the Attorney General forNorthern Ireland. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointlymay defend proceedings.
15A court, other than the House of Lords or Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland, may refer a devolution issue to the Court ofAppeal in Northern Ireland.
16A tribunal from which there is no appeal must
refer any devolution issue to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, andany other tribunal may make such a reference.

Northern Ireland may refer any devolution issue to the Judicial Committee ofChapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Act establishes a Human Rights Commission,26consisting of a Chief
Commissioner and other Commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State,who, in making the appointments, must ensure so far as practicable that theCommissioners, as a group, are representative of the community in NorthernIreland.
27The functions of the Commission include ensuring the adequacy
and effectiveness of law and practice in relation to the protection of humanrights, and reporting to the Secretary of State such recommendations as areconsidered necessary to improve law and practice. The Commission has aduty to advise the Assembly on the compatibility of Bills with human rights.The Commission is also under a duty to promote understanding andawareness of the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland. TheCommission may conduct such investigations as it considers necessary orexpedient. The Commission may also give assistance to individuals and bringproceedings in relation to human rights law and practice.
28Where a person
applies for assistance, the Commission may grant the application on thegrounds that the case raises a question of principle; that it would beunreasonable to expect the person to deal with the case without assistance, orthat there are other special circumstances warranting assistance. Assistanceincludes the provision of legal advice, arrangements for legal representationand any other assistance the Commission thinks appropriate.

North-South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council
The Belfast Agreement established two new bodies, designed to facilitate andpromote co-operative relations between the United Kingdom and theRepublic of Ireland. The North-South Ministerial Council is to compriserepresentatives of the Irish government and the Northern Ireland Executivewith a view to fostering cross-community participation in the Council. TheFirst Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly nominate ministers tothe Council. Agreements reached by meetings of the North-South MinisterialCouncil will be given effect by the Assembly, and no agreement entered intoshall come into effect without the approval of the Assembly.

SCOTLAND
In 1989, a Scottish Constitutional Convention was set up, following the
publication of A Claim of Right for Scotland by the Campaign for a Scottish
Assembly. It was argued that the people of Scotland had the right to governthemselves, and that the conventional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty,as understood south of the border, had no basis in Scottish political thought.In Scotland, the preferred view is that the people, not parliament, aresovereign. The final report of the Convention, Scotland’s Parliament, Scotland’s
Right was published in November 1995.
While the former Conservative government was opposed to any
devolution of power to either Scotland or Wales, the Labour governmentelected in 1997 declared in its election Manifesto that it favoured the
devolution of power. In the words of the Manifesto , ‘our proposal is for
devolution not federation. A sovereign Westminster Parliament will devolvepower to Scotland and Wales. The Union will be strengthened and the threatof separatism removed’. 
The referendum
The Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997 provided the mechanismsfor testing the wishes of the people. The Scottish people were asked to voteboth for or against a Scottish Parliament, and for or against the propositionthat the Scottish Parliament should have tax varying powers. The referendumin Scotland took place in September 1997. In favour of the establishment of aScottish Parliament were 74.3 per cent of voters, and in favour of tax varyingpowers, 63.5 per cent. 
Devolution and the Treaty of Union
The Union with Scotland Act 1706 and Union with England Act 1707 remainin force and have effect subject to the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998.
35
(section 37 of the 1998 Act). The government is firmly committed tostrengthening the Union, and makes it clear that Scotland continues to forman integral part of the United Kingdom:
The government want a United Kingdom which everyone feels part of, can
contribute to, and in whose future all have a stake. The Union will bestrengthened by recognising the claims of Scotland, Wales and the regionswith strong identities of their own. The government’s devolution proposals, bymeeting these aspirations, will not only safeguard but also enhance theUnion.

375THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
The meeting of parliament
The Scottish Parliament is unicameral and has a fixed four year term of office.
The first general election for parliament was held in May 1999 and subsequentgeneral elections will be held on the first Thursday in May in the fourthcalendar year following that in which the previous ordinary general electionwas held.
37
Provision is made for the holding of extraordinary general elections under
section 3. If parliament resolves that it should be dissolved, and on the votetaken, not less than two-thirds of the total number of Members of Parliamentvote in favour, then by proclamation the Queen may dissolve parliament andrequire an extraordinary general election to be held. If an ordinary generalelection would otherwise take place within six months, that election shall nottake place, but subsequent ordinary general elections will not be affected.
The electoral process
In the White Paper, Scotland’s Parliament ,38 the government recognised the
need both for a strong constituency link and for greater proportionalitybetween votes cast and seats won to be achieved through the election ofadditional members. Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) are elected intwo different ways. The majority are elected from constituencies which are thesame as the constituencies of the Westminster Parliament, except that Orkneyand Shetland become two separate constituencies, thus making 73 in total. Theremaining 56 Members – ‘additional members’ – are selected from party listsdrawn up for each of the current European Parliament constituencies. Thereare seven additional members from each constituency.
39
The Scottish Parliament was established under section 1 of the Scotland
Act 1998. The 129 seat parliament is based in Edinburgh. The parliament’s firsttask was to elect a Presiding Officer and two deputies.
40The role of Presiding
Officer is analogous to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons,although distinctions between the two offices exist. For example, the PresidingOfficer has been given statutory functions under the Act, inter alia in relation
to the holding of general elections and by-elections, notifications of filling ofvacancies of regional seats, notice of member’s resignation, administeringoaths to witnesses, the scrutiny of Bills to ensure they fall within the

42entering into contracts, and bringing or
defending proceedings against the Scottish Parliament.43
Parliamentary proceedings
Parliamentary proceedings are regulated by standing orders.44The Act
confers on the Scottish Parliament the power to call for witnesses anddocuments, and provides for criminal penalties in the event of failure tocomply with parliament’s directions. Under section 23, ‘any person’ may berequired to attend parliament to give evidence, or to produce documents ‘inhis custody or under his control’, relating to any subject for which a memberof the Executive has general responsibility. Section 23(3), (4), (5) and (6) limitsthe requirements to give evidence by ministers of the Crown and civilservants, in order to avoid the situation where ministers and civil servantsfind themselves accountable to both the United Kingdom and ScottishParliament. Under sub-section (7), parliament cannot require judges ormembers of tribunals to attend and give evidence. Where a person is requiredto attend, the Clerk will give written notice of the time and place at which thepersons to attend, and the particular subjects concerning which he is requiredto give evidence, or the documents or type of documents which are to beproduced, and the date by which they must be produced.
45A person served
with such notice, who refuses or fails to attend, or to answer questions, or who‘alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys any document which he is required toproduce’, or fails or refuses to produce such a document is guilty of anoffence. It is a defence to prove that the person concerned had a reasonableexcuse for the refusal or failure. If found guilty, the person is liable to a finenot exceeding level five or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding threemonths.
46The Presiding Officer may administer an oath to any person giving
evidence in proceedings of parliament, and require that person to take theoath. Under section 26, a person refusing to take the oath when so required isguilty of an offence carrying the same penalty as under section 25(4).

Legislation
The Scottish Parliament has the power to make Acts of Parliament within the
sphere of competence laid down in the Act. Any Act which is outside thelegislative competence of the parliament is not law.
47Section 28(7) makes
clear that the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament does not affectthe power of the parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws forScotland. The member of the Scottish Executive in charge of a Bill must state,on or before its introduction in parliament, that the provisions of the Bill arewithin the legislative competence of parliament.
48Additionally, the Presiding
Officer must, on or before the introduction of a Bill in the parliament, decidewhether or not the provisions of the bill are within the legislative competenceof parliament.
49It is for the Presiding Office to submit Bills for the royal
assent, but he may not do so at any time when the Advocate General, LordAdvocate or Attorney General is entitled to refer the Bill to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council to determine whether or not a Bill, or any ofits provisions, are within the legislative competence of the parliament.
50A
reference to the Judicial Committee may be made at any time during the fourweek period beginning with the passing of the Bill.
51The Judicial Committee
may request a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice underArticle 177 (now Article 234) of the Treaty of Rome.
52To avoid excessive
delay in the enactment of Bills, parliament may resolve that it intends toreconsider a Bill which has been referred to the Privy Council and if it does sothe person who referred it to the Privy Council must request the withdrawalof the reference from the European Court.
53Where the Secretary of State for
Scotland has reasonable grounds to believe that a Bill would be incompatiblewith international obligations or the interests of defence or national security,or would adversely modify the law relating to reserved matters, the Secretaryof State may make an order prohibiting the Presiding Officer from submittingthe Bill for royal assent.
54
Section 29 stipulates that an Act is not law if it is outside the parliament’s
legislative competence and states that a provision is outside its competence ifit relates to the law of a country or territory other than Scotland; it relates toreserved matters; its is in breach of the restrictions in Schedule 4; it isincompatible with Convention rights or with Community law, or wouldremove the Lord Advocate from his position as head of the systems of

criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths in Scotland. The most
complex provisions relate to reserved matters and incompatibility with therestrictions in Schedule 4 of the Act, and these in turn must be read inconjunction with Schedule 5 which lists the matters reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament.
Schedule 4: enactments protected from modification
Paragraphs 4 to 6 prohibit the Scottish Parliament from amending ormodifying the Scotland Act 1998. In addition, the Acts of Union are immunefrom amendment, as is the European Communities Act 1972 and assortedother specified Acts. Further there is a prohibition on modification of reservedmatters. 
Schedule 5: reserved matters
Part I of Schedule 5 lays down five general categories of matters reserved tothe United Kingdom Parliament: the constitution; the registration of politicalparties; foreign affairs; Civil Service, defence and treason. Part II lists specificreservations under 11 broad heads, namely: financial and economic matters;home affairs, trade and industry; energy; transport; social security; regulationof the professions; employment; health and medicines; media and culture andmiscellaneous. Matters reserved facilitate United Kingdom-wide uniformity,while devolving to the Scottish Parliament the power to regulate non-reservedmatters according to national requirements. Schedule 5 also provides forcertain exceptions to apply to particular reserved matters. For example underHead A: Financial and Economic Matters, which in turn has five sectionscovering fiscal, economic and monetary policy, the currency, financialservices, financial markets and money laundering, an exception to fiscal,economic and monetary policy is provided for local taxes to fund localauthority expenditure in Scotland, and in relation to financial services, anexception is made in relation to the dates of bank holidays. Accordingly, thescope of the legislative power devolved is defined within the Act, to the extentthat precision and foreseeability allow. Inevitably, however, these detailedand complex provisions give rise to questions as to the power devolved.
It was seen above that section 29 of the Act states that an Act of the
Scottish Parliament is not law so far as it is outside the legislative competenceof the parliament, and that provision is made for references to be made to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council before a Bill receives the royalassent.
55Challenges may arise by virtue of judicial review proceedings, or in
the course of civil or criminal proceedings. 
Part II of Schedule 6 details the procedures relating to proceedings in
Scotland. Either the Advocate General or the Lord Advocate may instituteproceedings, and the Lord Advocate may defend proceedings instituted byChapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

the Advocate General. This power is without prejudice to any power to
institute or defend proceedings exercisable by any person (paragraph 4).Where a devolution issue is intimated in any legal proceedings, notice must begiven to the Advocate General and the Lord Advocate; for the case law inrelation to this, see Chapter 19.
The European Convention rights became enforceable in Scotland on 1 July
1999, 15 months before coming into force in England, and it is in Scotland thatthe impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 was first experienced. The ScotlandAct 1998, section 57(2), provides that a member of the Scottish Executive ‘hasno power to make any subordinate legislation, or to do any other act, so far asthe legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights or withCommunity law’. In Starrs v Ruxton (2000)
56the Lord Advocate was held to
have acted ultra vires section 57(2), through the prosecution by his
representative the procurator fiscal, of an offence heard by a temporarysheriff. A temporary sheriff – being dependent upon the Lord Advocate forreappointment – was held not to constitute an ‘independent and impartialtribunal’ as required by Article 6(1) of the Convention.
Judicial impartiality came under scrutiny in Hoekstra v HM Advocate (No 3)
(2000), in which it was held that an article written by Lord McCluskycriticising the Convention disqualified him from sitting in that his articlecould give rise to a ‘legitimate apprehension of bias’ against the Convention.
The problem of reading primary legislation so as to make its compatible
with the Convention was confronted by the High Court of Justiciary in Brown
v Stott (2000). Section 172(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 requires the driver
of a motor vehicle to identify him or herself. The accused was convicted ofdriving while drunk and appealed against conviction, arguing that the RoadTraffic Act violated her right to silence and right against self-incriminationcontrary to Article 6(1) of the Convention. The Court allowed her appeal.
Members’ interests
Section 39 of the Scotland Act regulates Members’ interests. It provides for aRegister of interests and requires Members to register financial interests,including benefits in kind, and for Members to declare interests before takingpart in any proceedings in parliament relating to that matter. Members ofParliament are prohibited from ‘advocating or initiating any cause or matter ...in consideration of any payment or benefit in kind ...’ or from ‘urging, inconsideration of any such payment or benefit in kind, any other Member ofthe Parliament to advocate or initiate any cause or matter ...’. A Member ofParliament failing to comply with, or in contravention of the prohibition, isguilty of an offence, and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceedinglevel five on the standard scale.
37956 See, also, Gibbs v Ruxton (2000); Clancy v Caird (2000); Millar v Lord Advocate (2000).

Parliamentary committees
A Parliamentary Bureau is established with the task of proposing the
establishment, membership, remit and duration of committees. The Bureaualso proposes the political party whose members are eligible to be theconvenor (chairperson) and deputy convenor of the committee. The Bureau’sproposals are subject to parliamentary approval. A number of mandatorycommittees have been established, which sit for the duration of aparliamentary session. A number of additional committees have beenestablished, including Education Culture and Sport, Enterprise and LifelongLearning, Finance, Health and Community Care, Justice and Home Affairs,Local Government, Procedures, Rural Affairs, Social Inclusion, Housing andVoluntary Sector, Standards, Subordinate Legislation and Transport and theEnvironment.
Parliamentary privilege57
Section 41 provides that for the purposes of the law of defamation anystatement made in proceedings of the parliament and the publication of anystatement under the authority of parliament is absolutely privileged.
Maladministration
Section 91 of the Scotland Act makes provision for the investigation ofcomplaints made to Members in respect of the exercise of functions by theScottish Executive.
THE EXECUTIVE
Under section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998, there is established a ScottishExecutive, whose members are the First Minister, and such ministers as theFirst Minister appoints, and the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General forScotland. The First Minister is appointed by Her Majesty from amongmembers of the parliament, and holds office at Her Majesty’s pleasure (section45). Members of the Executive are responsible to the Scottish Parliament.
The continuing role of the Secretary of State for Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for focusing on promotingcommunication between the Scottish Parliament and Executive and betweenthe United Kingdom Parliament and government on matters of mutualinterests, and on representing Scottish interests in reserved matters.

Scottish representation at Westminster
The problematic issue of continued Scottish representation at Westminsterafter devolution, particularly in relation to matters exclusively English (the‘West Lothian question’), was addressed by initially continuing the same levelof Scottish representation as hitherto. However, section 86 of the Scotland Act1998 amends Schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 byomitting rule 1(2) requiring Scotland to have not less than 71 constituencies,and providing for Scottish representation in the future to be based on thesame electoral quota as for England. The effect is that representation will bereduced to 59 seats.
The West Lothian question
The government avoided the complexities of the West Lothian question whichbedevilled the debate about devolution in previous times. The term derivesfrom the Member of Parliament for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell, although theproblem posed had been equally difficult in the nineteenth century in relationto Irish Home Rule (on which, see Chapter 3), and later in relation to thedevolution of legislative power to Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972. Inessence, the West Lothian question concerns over- or under-representation inthe Westminster Parliament once legislative power is devolved to a regionalparliament.
The difficulty stems from continued regional representation in the
Westminster Parliament. The first problem is that of regional representativeparticipation in the legislative process as it relates exclusively to England. Insimple terms, the argument made is that, if the Scottish Parliament hasexclusive competence in relation to health matters, on what legitimate basisshould Scottish Members of the Westminster Parliament have the right toinfluence health matters which relate exclusively to English people? On theother side of that particular coin, lies the fact that, whereas the ScottishMembers of the Westminster Parliament may exert influence on purely
38159Scotland’s Parliament, Cm 3658, 1997, London: HMSO, paras 4.8, 4.9.

English health issues, the Westminster Parliament and its Members, by
contrast, have no equal right to influence the decisions of the ScottishParliament in relation to the same matters. 
When a government has a large majority, as the current government
enjoys – or even a workable majority – the issue is less problematic. However,in a situation where a government has no clear and workable majority withinthe Westminster Parliament, the difficulty is more pronounced. In the lattersituation, it may well be that the government of the day becomes dependenton Scottish representatives at Westminster in order to enact legislation. Thequestion of legitimacy becomes more acute when the proposed legislationrelates exclusively to an English matter and the correlative legislative powerover that matter in relation to Scotland has been devolved to the ScottishParliament. 
This position was precisely that which faced the Labour government in the
1960s. In 1964, the Labour government was returned to parliament with amajority of three. At that time, Northern Ireland enjoyed a degree oflegislative autonomy from the rest of the United Kingdom, and Northern Irishrepresentation at Westminster included 12 Ulster Unionist Members. In 1965,parliament was considering the Manchester Corporation Bill and Rent Bill,which did not relate to Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Membersopposed the Bill and aligned themselves with the Conservative Opposition.The same position arose in relation to the Labour government’s proposals tonationalise the steel industry. The Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson,addressed the issue directly when he stated that he:
... would hope that Northern Ireland Members who are here, and who are
welcomed here, for the duties they have to perform on behalf of the UnitedKingdom in many matters affecting Northern Ireland, would consider theirposition in matters where we have no equivalent right in Northern Ireland.
60
Possible solutions to the West Lothian question
A number of solutions have been proposed to the West Lothian question, each
of which must be considered. First, it would be theoretically possible toexclude Scottish representation at Westminster. Secondly, it would be possibleto reduce the strength of Scottish representation at Westminster in order toreduce the possibility of Scottish representatives alone having real power in asituation of a small majority, or minority, government. Thirdly, it would bepossible to legislate to ensure that Scottish representatives only have alegislative role in relation to legislation concerning Scotland, and none inrelation to legislation which has a purely English dimension (the ‘in and out’approach).Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law
38260 HC Deb Vol 711 Col 1561, 6 May 1965.

Regional and Local Government
Exclusion of Scottish representation
Short of devolution taking the form of a dismantling of the Union, which has
endured for nearly 300 years, and conferring complete legal and politicalindependence upon Scotland, this solution is not viable. The devolution ofpower falls far short of complete legislative independence. The ScottishParliament enjoys legislative competence in relation to matters which are notreserved to the Westminster Parliament. Accordingly, in matters reserved tothe Westminster Parliament, it is not tenable to argue that there should be noScottish representation at Westminster and, a fortiori, that there should be no
representation in relation to matters relating to Scotland which have beenreserved to the Westminster Parliament. To adopt such a policy would ensurenot the strengthening of the Union, but its rapid and ultimate demise and thebreak up of the United Kingdom. 
The ‘in and out’ solution
This possible solution was one ruled out under the present government’sinsistence that the Union with Scotland be strengthened rather thanweakened, and that Scottish Members of Parliament should continue to play afull role in the proceedings of the House of Commons. However, it is asolution which has long been considered in relation to solving the difficultiesinherent in devolving legislative power to one region alone.
The ‘in and out’ solution was mooted in relation to Irish Home Rule, but
rejected by Gladstone as unworkable. The ‘in and out’ solution requires amechanism whereby legislation is classified as applying to either the UnitedKingdom as a whole, or to Scotland in matters reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament, or solely to England. Where legislative proposals relateto either the United Kingdom as a whole, or to Scotland in reserved matters,the ‘in and out’ solution would enable Scottish representatives to vote.However, if a matter related solely to England or England and Wales,(legislative competence over that matter in relation to Scotland having beendevolved) Scottish representatives would be ineligible to vote on the matter.In relation to Irish Home Rule, it was suggested that it should be the Speakerof the House of Commons who classifies Bills for this purpose. If ‘in and out’was not viable in the nineteenth century, it is likely not to be viable in thetwenty-first century. 
There also exists a different objection to this solution, which is less based
on practicality, and is more principled. The problem involves governmentswith a small majority in parliament and minority governments. In both casesthe government may find itself dependent upon Scottish representation(and/or on other minority groups). Were the government to find itself in a
383

position of dependence on Scottish representation, and the ‘in and out’
solution had been adopted, the Scottish representation on which thegovernment was dependent would be absent in relation to legislation on amatter solely relating to England. Thus, the ‘in and out’ solution could lead toan otherwise, albeit barely, viable government being defeated. Moreover, in asituation where a government had no electoral support in Scotland, and thegovernment has a weak majority, as occurred under the last Conservativegovernment, that government could be held to ransom by Scottishrepresentatives who support alternative policies.
Financial arrangements61
The Scottish Parliament has the power to increase or decrease the basic rate of
income tax set by the United Kingdom Parliament by up to three pence in thepound. The Inland Revenue will continue to administer tax variations.
Since the 1970s, there has existed a ‘block formula’ system of funding
Scotland’s public expenditure programmes. There have been adjustments
made to this arrangement, and the Scottish Parliament also has tax varyingpowers which enable it to raise revenue independently. The parliament isentitled to determine its own expenditure priorities. The parliament haspowers to control Scottish local government expenditure and to finance localgovernment. The parliament also has control over the form of local taxation,both domestic and non-domestic. There is a statutory duty to maintaineffective scrutiny and audit arrangements.
Debating powers
The Scottish Parliament is able to examine devolved matters, and debate allmatters irrespective of whether they are devolved or reserved.
62
Scotland and the European Union and Community
While relations with Europe are the responsibility of the United KingdomParliament and government, the Scottish Parliament and Executive plays animportant role in relation to those aspects of European Union affairs whichaffect devolved areas. The government has promised to ensure that ScottishOffice ministers play a full role in European Union Councils. Scottish Officeofficials will participate in discussion with the relevant Whitehall department.The Scottish Executive and officials will be directly involved in thegovernment’s decision making and formulation of policy in relation toEuropean Union matters.Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law
38461 See Scotland Act 1998, Pts III and IV.
62Scotland’s Parliament, Cm 3658, 1997, London: HMSO, para 2.5.

Regional and Local Government
The Scottish Parliament scrutinises European Union legislative proposals
‘to ensure that Scotland’s interests are properly reflected’. Responsibility for
ensuring the implementation of European Union obligations lies with theScottish Executive. The overall approach to be pursued is as follows:
The guiding principle which the United Kingdom government sets out to
establish in the relationship with the Scottish Executive on European Unionmatters is that there should be the closest possible working relationship andinvolvement. Provided the Scottish Executive is willing to work in that spirit ofcollaboration and trust, there will be an integrated process which will buildupon the benefits of the current role of the Scottish Office within government.Taken together, these arrangements will allow Scotland, within the UnitedKingdom, to develop its role in the European Union. [para 5.12]
The Scottish Parliament and local government and other bodies
Relations with local government and other public bodies are based on the
following principles:
(a) the Scottish Parliament should set the national framework within which
other Scottish public bodies operate;
(b) local authorities, non-departmental public bodies and other Scottish public
bodies should be open and accountable to the Scottish people through the
Scottish Parliament and its Executive or, in the case of local authorities,directly through local elections. [para 6.3]
General responsibility for legislation and policy relating to local government
lie with the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament has responsibility forall Scottish public bodies whose functions and services are devolved.
WALES
The previous attempt to devolve power to Wales has been discussed inChapter 3. Consistent with the 1997 Labour government’s commitment todevolution, an Assembly for Wales has been established. However, whereasthe Scottish Parliament has full legislative powers in relation to devolvedmatters, the Welsh Assembly’s role and functions are more limited.
Rather than devolve legislative power to a Welsh Parliament, the
Government of Wales Act 1998 provides for a directly elected Assemblywhich has the responsibilities currently exercised by the Secretary of State forWales. The devolution is thus conferring administrative rather than legislativecompetence. The government’s White Paper, A Voice for Wales: The
Government’s Proposals for a Welsh Assembly ,
63perceived a ‘democratic deficit’
in the administrative arrangements for Wales. Until devolution, the majority

of administrative matters were the responsibility of the Welsh Office. Other
bodies, such as health authorities and National Health Service Trusts, andunelected bodies, such as the Welsh Development Agency and Further andHigher Education Funding Councils and Tai Cymru, were not accountable to
the Welsh people. The only directly accountable bodies were local authorities.The devolution of administrative competence to the Welsh Assembly toredresses this lack of local accountability.
The referendum 
The result of the referendum held to determine the people’s wishes in respectof devolved powers was less clear-cut than that of the Scottish referendum.Only 50 per cent of the electorate voted, as compared with 60 per cent in theScottish referendum, and 50.3 per cent voted in favour of the establishment ofan Assembly. A majority of voters in 11 of the 22 local government areasvoted in favour.
THE WELSH ASSEMBLY
Meetings of the Assembly
Section 1 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 established the WelshAssembly. As with the Scottish Parliament, the Assembly sits for a fixed fouryear term of office. The Assembly has 60 Members. Unlike the ScottishParliament, however, the Assembly has no power to dissolve itself before theend of the four year term of office. The Assembly is staffed by existing WelshOffice staff. The first Assembly met in 1999. Initial Standing Orders for theAssembly have been drawn up by an all-Party Commission. The Assemblyruns under a committee system. An Executive Committee provides the overalldirection for the Assembly and comprises members of the majority partyalone. Regional Committees have been established to ensure that the needs ofeach area of Wales are properly considered. The Regional Committees areadvisory bodies only and do not have specific functions or decision makingpowers. 
Members of the Assembly are salaried, and allowances are payable.
64
The electoral system
The additional member electoral system is employed for elections.65There are
40 constituency Members, elected on the simple majority system, and 20additional members elected from the party list. Each voter has two votes – onefor the constituency Member and one for the additional member. The firstChapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Regional and Local Government
elections took place in the spring of 1999. Thereafter, elections take place every
four years, on the first Thursday in May.66
THE LEADER AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The overall political direction of the Assembly is provided by a Leader of theAssembly, elected by the Assembly, and an Executive Committee (section 56).The Executive Committee, headed by the Leader, comprises leaders ofdiffering subject committees. The Act allows for the Executive Committee tobe made up of members of a single political party, and to sit in private. TheCommittee is thus envisaged to be the equivalent of the British Cabinet. TheLeader of the Committee faces questions in the Assembly concerning allissues.
Welsh representation at Westminster
Because the Assembly does not have devolved legislative powers, the WestLothian question does not arise. The Secretary of State for Wales and WelshMembers of Parliament continue to play a full role at Westminster, but onewhich also involves a new partnership with the Assembly.
67The number of
Welsh Members remains unchanged.
The relationship between Westminster and the Assembly
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster continues to legislate forWales. Members of the Assembly need to develop a close partnership withWelsh Members of Parliament. The White Paper stated that the governmentintended that the Assembly should be able to ‘seek to influence legislationwhich is being considered at Westminster’.
68The Secretary of State for Wales
is under a statutory duty to consult the Assembly about the government’slegislative programme, after it has been announced in the Queen’s Speech,and the Assembly, following debate, may draft its response. The Secretary ofState is able to attend Assembly debates, but not entitled to vote.
In relation to subordinate legislation, however, the Executive Committee
and subject committees have power to prepare secondary legislation forsubmission to the Assembly for debate and approval. Such pieces ofsecondary legislation are known as Assembly Orders. A subordinatelegislation scrutiny committee has been established to consider draft statutoryinstruments and to report to the Assembly (section 58 of the 1998 Act). TheAssembly has the power to revoke, replace or amend such legislation in the
38766 Government of Wales Act 1998, s 3.
67A Voice for Wales: The Government’s Proposals for a Welsh Assembly, Cm 3718, 1997,

68Ibid, para 3.38. 

same manner as the Secretary of State had formerly been able to do. Proposed
Orders relating to Wales are scrutinised by the Assembly’s subjectcommittees.
69
The powers of the Welsh Assembly
As stated above, the Assembly takes over many of the responsibilities whichformerly lay with the Secretary of State for Wales. Part II of the Government ofWales Act 1998 defines the functions of the Assembly. Section 22 provides forthe transfer of ministerial functions to the Assembly, by the means of Ordersin Council. Any ministerial function exercisable by a minister of the Crown inrelation to Wales may be transferred. The Order in Council may also directthat any function transferred may be exercisable by the Assemblyconcurrently with the minister of the Crown, or alternatively direct that afunction exercisable by a minister of the Crown in relation to Wales shall beexercisable by the minister only with the agreement of, or after consultationwith, the Assembly.
70
The Committee structure
In addition to the Executive Committee, the Assembly is required to establishCommittees required under the Act, and other such Committees and sub-committees as the Assembly considers appropriate.
71
Subject committees are established with responsibilities to the fields in
which the Assembly has functions. A member of the Executive Committeewho has responsibility for a particular matter is a member of the SubjectCommittee. In addition, a Subordinate Legislation Committee is established toconsider ‘relevant Welsh subordinate legislation’ and ‘Assembly generalsubordinate legislation’. Members of the Committee are elected by theAssembly from its members and so far as practicable shall ensure the balanceof the parties in the Assembly is reflected in the Committee.
72An Audit
Committee is established,73its members elected from Assembly members,
again reflecting, so far as practicable, party political representation in theAssembly. Section 61 provides for the establishment of regional committees. ACommittee for North Wales is established, and the Assembly may alsoestablish a committee for each of the other regions of Wales.Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

389Members’ interests
A register of interest is established, requiring any Assembly member who has
financial interest or other interest in any matter to be registered and fordeclarations of interest to be made before participating in Assemblyproceedings. Under section 72, members are prohibited from advocating anycause on behalf of any person in consideration of payments or benefits inkind, or to urge another Assembly member to advocate or initiate any cause inconsideration of any payment or benefit in kind. It is an offence to act inviolation of the section 72 procedures, and a person found guilty of an offenceis liable on summary conviction to a fine. Prosecutions may only be institutedby or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Similarprovisions to those in the Scotland Act relate to the attendance of witnesses,giving of evidence and production of documents.
74
Privilege
Section 77 provides that any statement made for the purposes of, or forpurposes incidental to proceedings of the Assembly (including committeeproceedings), and the publication of reports of such proceedings, areabsolutely qualified for the purposes of the law of defamation. 
The continuing role of the Secretary of State for Wales
While many of the powers exercised by the Secretary of State are transferredto the Assembly, the Executive Committee and its Subject Committees, theSecretary of State continues to play a pivotal role. The Secretary of Statecontinues to represent Wales in Cabinet, having listened to the views of theAssembly, although he or she is not bound by the Assembly’s views. TheSecretary of State also meets regularly with the Executive Committee toexchange views about government policy. The Secretary of State is entitled toattend and participate in proceedings of the Assembly, but not to vote or toattend committee proceedings.
The Assembly and the Welsh economy
A principal thrust behind the government’s devolution of power is economic.The economy of Wales was formerly dominated by heavy industry – coal andsteel – but has now diversified into more modern manufacturing industries.Nevertheless, as the White Paper made clear, economic prosperity is notevenly spread in Wales and there remain areas with high unemployment,poor health, poor housing and social deprivation. As a result, Welsh gross
74 Government of Wales Act 1998, ss 74, 75.

domestic product per head remains fixed at around 84 per cent of the UK
average.75
The government considered that the Assembly would provide the driving
force in relation to economic growth and recovery. The governmentsummarised the role of the Assembly in relation to economic affairs asfollows:
The Assembly will:
(a) provide leadership in setting a new economic agenda for Wales attuned to
the needs of Wales;
(b) deliver its programmes through a new economic powerhouse – the
expanded Welsh Development Agency, which will take on the functions of
the Development Board for Rural Wales and the Land Authority for Wales;
(c) develop its policies in partnership with local authorities, industry, further
and higher education, Training and Enterprise Councils and the voluntarysector;
(d) seek further inward investment, widening the Welsh industrial and
commercial base;
(e) forge close and dynamic international links with other regions in
Europe.
76
Financial matters77
Wales had been managed under a block formula, with the Secretary of State
for Wales responsible for over half of government expenditure in Wales. The1997–98 provision for the block, including central government support forlocal authorities, was £6,636 billion. Now that the Assembly is established,these arrangements will continue, save that the Secretary of State determineshow much of the block should be reserved for his office’s costs, and theremainder is available to the Assembly. The Assembly manages its ownspending priorities, and reports annually on expenditure. Wales continues toreceive an agriculture allocation under the European Union’s CommonAgriculture Policy.
Resolving disputes about devolution issues
The White Paper stated that if the Assembly exceeded its powers, thegovernment would be able to challenge the ultra vires use of power in the
courts. In addition, where devolution issues arise in civil or criminalproceedings before either courts or tribunal, the Act stipulates the procedureto be followed. Section 109 and Schedule 7 to the Act regulate such challenges.A devolution issue is defined as:Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Welsh Assembly and the European Union and Community
While the United Kingdom government remains responsible for issues arising
out of membership of the European Union, it is recognised that Wales needs astrong voice in Europe.
83The Assembly is able to scrutinise legislative
proposals and other European documents. The Assembly also has theresponsibility for ensuring that European Union obligations are implementedand enforced, and to meet any financial penalties which may arise out offailure to implement or enforce Union obligations. Within the framework ofthe Council of Ministers, the Secretary of State for Wales participates inmeetings of the Council. The Wales European Centre in Brussels continues toact as a facilitator and source of advice on European matters. Members of theAssembly represent Wales on the Committee of the Regions. EuropeanStructural Funds are an important source of funding for the regeneration ofthe Welsh economy. It is estimated that payments under these funds amountto £1,280 million in the five years to 1995 to 2000. The Welsh Office hadformerly been responsible for negotiations over the funds, and for theirimplementation and management. The role of the Welsh Office in thesematters has been transferred to the Assembly.
84
The Assembly and local authorities and other public bodies85
The Assembly works in partnership with local authorities, other public bodiesand voluntary bodies, in order to ensure greater local democracy andaccountability. The funding of local authorities has been taken over by theAssembly from the Welsh Office.
86
The Assembly has been given significant powers in relation to
appointments to Welsh public bodies, taking over responsibility from theSecretary of State for Wales. The Assembly also has power to issue directionsto various bodies (quangos) and to monitor their performance. In relation tounelected bodies in Wales, such as the Welsh Tourist Board, the Assembly haspower to restructure bodies in order to ensure improved economiceffectiveness and efficient working.
87In a major rationalisation of public
bodies, the Welsh Development Agency, which plays a pivotal role ineconomic matters, has been reformed and takes over the responsibilities of theDevelopment Board for Rural Wales, which has been abolished.

also assumes the powers and functions formerly vested in the Land Authorityfor Wales.

LONDON: THE GREATER LONDON 
AUTHORITY AND MAYOR
In addition to the government’s firm commitment to devolution to Scotland
and Wales, and the future consideration of devolution to the English regions,the government intended to introduce an elected ‘strategic authority’ forLondon. As noted below, the Greater London Council (GLC), which formerlyrepresented a centralising focus for the capital city, was abolished in 1985.Many of the GLC’s functions reverted to the individual London councils.London was unique in being a capital city without an elected Mayor andcentralised area government. This perceived deficiency has been redressed.The government’s White Paper, A Mayor and Assembly for London , proposed an
elected Mayor and 25 seat Greater London Authority. The Authority does nothave direct tax raising powers, but revenue will be raised from road tolls andparking fees. In addition, the Authority is funded by central government. Areferendum held in the spring of 1998 established popular support for theproposal.
90The Greater London Authority Act 1999 regulates the Authority.
Elections
The first election was held in May 2000, electing an Assembly and Mayor for afour-year term of office.
91Every eligible elector has one vote for the mayoral
candidate, one vote for an Assembly member and one vote – a ‘London vote’ –for a registered political party.
The simple majority voting system is used for the mayoral election unless
there are three or more candidates. Where three or more candidates stand, theMayor is elected under the supplementary vote system, a vote which indicatesthe voter’s first and second preferences from among the candidates.
92The
Assembly members are elected under the simple majority system.93The
London vote, for a registered political party which has submitted a list ofcandidates to be London members, or an individual who is a candidate to be aLondon member, is calculated according to Part II of Schedule 2 to the Act.The qualifications for election to be Mayor or an Assembly member are thatthe person must be a Commonwealth citizen; citizen of the Republic of Irelandor citizen of the European Union and be 21 years of age.

The Secretary of State may issue guidance to the Authority inrelation to the above general power.
95The requirements of consultation with
London councils and representative voluntary bodies and interest groups aredefined in section 32. Functions conferred on the Authority are exercisable bythe Mayor acting on behalf of the Authority. All functions conferred on theMayor acting on behalf of the Authority, or on the Authority alone, or on theMayor and Authority jointly are exercisable only by the Mayor acting onbehalf of the Authority, subject to any express provision to the contrary in theAct. Section 38 makes provision for the delegation of functions exercisable bythe Mayor to designated bodies.
The Authority is regulated by Standing Orders defining its procedures,
which are made in consultation with the Mayor. The office of Chair andDeputy Chair of the London Assembly is created. The Local Government Act1972, Part VA, regulating access to meetings and documents, applies to theAssembly and its committees, with the exception of confidential informationand exempt information which may be withheld from the press and thepublic. 
The Assembly is under a statutory duty to keep under review the Mayor’s

Assembly and answer questions put to him about matters relating to hisstatutory functions.
104Questions will be answered orally ‘so far as practicable
to do so’, or in writing before the end of the third working day following theday on which the question was asked at the meeting. An Annual Report is tobe prepared by the Mayor as soon as practicable after the end of each financialyear, reporting on his mayoral activities during the year.
Once in each financial year the Mayor must hold and attend a ‘State of
London debate’, open to all members of the public. In addition, twice in everyfinancial year, a ‘People’s Question Time’ shall be held, open to all membersof the public, for the purpose of putting questions to the Mayor and Assemblymembers. People’s Question Time is to be held within one month of the Stateof London debate.
105
Transport functions of the Authority
Part IV of the Act regulates transport. Under section 141, the Mayor is under aduty to develop and implement policies for the ‘promotion andencouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilitiesand services to, from and within Greater London’. The Act stipulates therespective powers and duties of the Secretary of State, the Mayor and Londonborough councils. ‘Transport for London’ is the functional body established toimplement the Mayor’s transport strategy, and will assume the functionspreviously exercised by a number of differing bodies. Transport for Londonhas wide-ranging responsibilities, including traffic management, maintenanceof roads, the London Underground, the regulation of bus services and railservices, road safety and parking, including the fixing of parking and othercharges for London. The making of public-private partnership agreements(PPP agreement) is provided for, enabling contracts between the LondonAuthority bodies and private companies for the provision, construction,improvement or maintenance of railways.
106
Transport for London comprises a Board of between eight and 15
members, all of whom are appointed by the Mayor. The Mayor designates oneof the members to be Chairman of Transport for London. Schedule 10 statesthat the Mayor may be a member, and if he elects to be so, shall be thechairman. The Mayor may issue guidance, general directions and specificdirections as to the exercise of its functions.

The London Development Agency
Part V of the Act establishes the London Development Agency and amends
the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 in relation to London. TheMayor is responsible for appointing the 15 members of the LondonDevelopment Agency, and must ensure that at least four members are electedmembers of the Assembly, a London borough council or the Common Councilof the City of London. The Mayor must consult the London Assembly beforemaking appointments. The Chairman is designated by the Mayor, and mustbe a ‘person who has experience of running a business’ (section 304). Thefunctions of the London Development Agency is to further economicdevelopment, promote business efficiency, investment and competitiveness,promote employment and to enhance the development and application ofskills relevant to employment and to contribute to sustainable development. 
The Mayor is responsible for preparing and publishing the London
Development Agency strategy, assisted by the Agency.
The Metropolitan Police
Section 310 of the Act inserts into section 5 of the Police Act 1996, section 5A:‘A police force shall be maintained for the metropolitan police district’, andsection 5B: ‘There shall be a police authority for the metropolitan policedistrict’, known as the Metropolitan Police Authority. Formerly, the PoliceAuthority for the Metropolitan Police District was the Home Secretary.Whereas other police forces in England and Wales were accountable to a localpolice authority, the Home Secretary’s responsibility as police authority meantthat London lacked the degree of local accountability existing outside London.The establishment of the Metropolitan Police Authority redresses this lack ofaccountability, and also ensures that the Mayor and Assembly have a role toplay in the combating of crime in the capital. The Metropolitan PoliceAuthority consists of 23 members, 12 of whom are members of the LondonAssembly appointed by the Mayor, one of whom must be the deputy Mayor,one appointed by the Secretary of State, six appointed by members of theMetropolitan Police Authority from persons on a shortlist prepared by theSecretary of State, and four magistrates for commission areas which arewholly or partly within the metropolitan police district. Members generallyserve a four year renewable term. The Authority shall appoint a chairmanfrom among its members.

PART II – LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES: AN OUTLINE121
Local government represents both a form of decentralisation of power fromcentral government and a basis for local democracy. Local governmentpredates central government by many centuries. Historically, localgovernment represented an early form of localised self-regulation. Thecountry is divided into local authorities – either county or district – eachhaving law making and administrative powers as delegated by parliament.Local authorities nowadays are entirely creatures of statute: accordingly, theonly powers which they have are those conferred by the sovereign UnitedKingdom Parliament. Increasingly, however, the law of the European Unionand Community also requires action at local authority level. 
THE ADVANTAGES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Central government is ill equipped to deal with many matters which requirespecial local knowledge and regulation on the basis of local needs. Thedevolution of power to directly elected local authorities enables those withlocal knowledge and expertise to regulate the provision of services, such aspublic housing, public sanitation, educational and recreational facilities. Localgovernment, therefore, is justified on the basis of efficiency. Local governmentalso represents the citizen’s closest contact with a democratic institution andenables individuals to play a role in the administration of their geographicalarea. The merits of local government were summarised by the WiddicombeCommittee
122as follows:
401120 Greater London Authority Act 1999, Sched 30, para 2.
121 See, inter alia , Sharpe, 1970; Byrne, 2000; Stewart and Stoker, 1989; Newton and Karran,
1985; Leach et al, 1994; Jones, 1997. Note that local government in Scotland and
Northern Ireland is differently arranged.
122The Conduct of Local Authority Business , Cmnd 9797, 1986, London: HMSO, and see
McAuslan, 1987. See, also, inter alia , Keith-Lucas and Richards, 1979.

The value of local government stems from its three attributes of:
(a) pluralism, through which it contributes to the national political system;
(b) participation, through which it contributes to local democracy;(c) responsiveness, through which it contributes to the provision of local
needs through the delivery of services. [p 47]
Local authority boundaries
In order to revise boundaries and to adjust them to reflect changes in
population the Local Government Act 1972 introduced the Local GovernmentBoundary Commissions. One Commission exists for England, Scotland andWales. The present structure was established following a lengthy inquiry intothe structure, role and functions of local authorities.
123
In 1992, a Local Government Commission,124appointed by the Secretary
of State for the Environment, was established under the Local GovernmentAct 1992 to review the structure, boundaries and electoral arrangements of allareas except London and the metropolitan areas. The government’s intentionwas to seek to increase the efficiency of local government and reduceoverlapping functions and bureaucracy. Accordingly, it was the government’sobjective to introduce unitary authorities which would replace the previoustwo tier structure. The reason for the proposed reforms was cost saving in thelong term. However, cost saving was the prediction and motivation behindthe 1972 reforms, when it was expected that reduced overheads would cutcosts, and that there would be a saving in relation to salaries alone of some £9million annually, an expectation which was not realised.
The proposed changes came about at the end of a period marked by
radical change in the functions local government. As will be seen, the thrust ofdevelopment over the period from 1979 to 1997, under the formerConservative government, was one towards compulsory competitivetendering for services and the privatisation of local government departments,reducing the role of Local Education Authorities. In the view of Sir JohnBoynton:
125‘... for good or ill the whole concept of local government as a
public service is being transformed.’ The reviews, however, ended incompromise. The Commission recommended the retention of the two tiersystem in many areas, but also proposed unitary councils in some areas. In1994, unitary councils were introduced in Scotland and Wales, withChapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law
402123 See, inter alia , Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England , Cmnd 4040,

Report’); Local Government in England, Cmnd 4585, 1971, London: HMSO; The Reform of

respectively 32 and 22 unitary councils being established.126In England, no
uniformity was achieved.127
Before the review began in 1992, the structure of local government in Great
Britain comprised some 515 councils, made up of the following:
In England: 32 London boroughs; the Corporation of London; 36
metropolitan districts; 39 county councils; 296 district councils. In Scotland:
nine regional councils; 53 district councils; three island councils. In Wales: 37district councils; eight county councils.
Following the review, the total number of councils in Britain was reduced
between 1994 and 1998 from 515 to 442. The number of authorities in Scotlandwas reduced from 62 to 32 unitary councils; whereas in Wales, 45 councilswere reduced to 22 unitary councils. In England, in 1998, there are 238 districtcouncils, 34 county councils and 46 new unitary authorities.
The current structure of local government
The structure of local government was substantially revised by the LocalGovernment Act 1972 and, further, by the Local Government Act 1985. Underthe 1972 Act, England was divided into six metropolitan counties outsideLondon.
128London was governed by the Greater London Council. In addition
to the metropolitan counties, 39 non-metropolitan counties were established.In 1983, the Conservative government abolished the Greater London Counciland the metropolitan county councils.
129As seen above, the current
government has introduced an elected Mayor and Assembly for London.
The size of local government
In comparison with other nations, local government in the United Kingdom isrepresented by substantially larger units, representing a substantially greaternumber of people. Before the latest reorganisation of local government,statistics reveal the average population per local authority.
130The figures
reveal that whereas the United Kingdom had an average population per localauthority of 118,400, the corresponding figure for France is 1,580; Germany is4,925; Norway, 9,000; Denmark 18,760 and Sweden 30,040. The populationsize of authorities naturally affects the number of constituents a local

lacked public support were abolished with effect from 1996. Ministerial guidance to the
Commission was successfully challenged in judicial review proceedings on the basisthat the guidance undermined the statutory criterion: R v Secretary of State for the

councillor will represent. Accordingly, in France, one elected representative
represents 116 people, in Germany 250, in Denmark 783, in Sweden 667 and inthe United Kingdom, 2,605. 
THE FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has no powers other than those conferred by parliament.The powers conferred must be exercised according to law, and judicial reviewof local authority decisions may be made to ensure that the rule of law isrespected.
131Some discretion exists, however, as to the means by which local
authorities achieve the goals set by central government. 
However, the freedom of local authorities to raise finance, to undertake
expenditure and to provide services was substantially reduced under theConservative government which assumed office in 1979 and lasted until 1997.During that time, as will be seen, the government altered the manner in whichlocal taxation was raised, set clear limits on expenditure and imposedsanctions on local authorities who exceeded the expenditure approved bycentral government. Moreover, the provision of services by local authoritieshas been significantly curtailed. Intent on improving efficiency and onprivatising many aspects of government previously performed either by localauthorities or by central government, ‘market forces’ were introduced tomany local authority services. Local authorities are now required to put manyservices out to tender to the private sector, and may provide servicesthemselves only if they can do so in a manner which is competitive withprivate companies and organisations. See, further, below.
In addition to taxation and the provision of services, local authorities have
a regulatory and law making role. Local councils have wide powers toregulate, for example, the granting of licences of taxis, market trading, theapproval of child care facilities and private welfare homes for the elderly,disabled or sick. In relation to law making, local authorities, acting under theauthority of Acts of Parliament, have the power to make bylaws – local lawswhich regulate the area. For example, footpaths, parks and recreationalfacilities are controlled by local bylaws. In the exercise of all such power, thelocal authority is subject to control by the courts: all local authorities must actintra vires (within their powers), or their decisions will be declared null and
void by the courts.Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law
404131 See Chapters 4, 24 and 25.

Regional and Local Government
The allocation of functions between authorities in England and
Wales 
Functions are allocated between local authorities principally on the basis of
‘operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness’.131The provision of certain
services, for example, education, is clearly a matter for regulation on a largescale, whereas the provision of local libraries and refuse collection may beappropriate for smaller councils to administer. However, there can be nogeneralisations about the distribution of functions: there are variationsthroughout. From the point of view of local democracy, and the accountabilityand responsiveness of local councillors, however, the larger the localgovernment unit, and the more diffuse the provision of services betweendiffering levels of local government, the more difficult it becomes for theindividual to apportion responsibility. In Byrne’s analysis, the allocation ofresponsibilities is made the more complex by the sharing of responsibilities,which of itself takes several forms. Shared responsibilities in this analysis mayinclude concurrent provision , whereby all local authorities provide the same
service in their area; or joint provision, where two or more local authorities
combine to provide a common service to all within their common area; orshared but divided provision , in which different levels of local authority provide
differing aspects of the same service; reserve powers, under which larger
authorities reserve the power to provide particular aspects of a serviceotherwise provided by smaller authorities; claimed powers, through which
individual, small authorities assume responsibility for a service or functionformally allocated to a larger authority, and agency powers, whereby one
authority will act as the agent of another authority in the provision of a serviceor exercise of certain functions.
133
In addition to the complexity in the allocation of functions between local
authorities must be considered the movement, discussed further below,towards compulsory competitive tendering (CCT), which obliges localauthorities to put the provision of services out to tender and, in the event thatthey wish to continue to make provision for a particular service, demonstratethat they can do so in a manner competitive with private companies. What isevident from this movement is that local authorities nowadays are far less theactual providers of services and more bodies which, through contract, enableservices to be provided by those in the private sector. Moreover, no picture oflocal government can be complete without recognition of the increased, andincreasing, functions formerly undertaken by local authorities, which are nowundertaken by boards and trusts under provisions introduced by theConservative government in relation to education and housing (discussed,further, below) which further fragments local government, accountability anddemocracy.

The Local Government Act 2000 regulates the duty of local authorities to
promote the economic, social or environmental well being of the relevant area.
Every local authority is to have power to prepare a strategy for promoting orimproving the economic, social and environmental well being of their area.The authority must consult or seek the participation of appropriate personsand must have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Undersection 5 of the Act, the Secretary of State has the power to amend, repeal orrevoke enactments relating to the strategy.
THE ELECTION PROCESS
Section 10 of the Representation of the People Act 2000 makes provision forgreater flexibility in the voting arrangements for local government elections. Alocal authority may submit to the Secretary of State proposals for a schemerelating to when, where and how voting is to take place, how the votes castare to be counted and the sending by candidates of election communicationsfree of postage charges. The scheme may make provision for voting to takeplace on more than one day, and at places other than polling booths. TheSecretary of State has power to approve the proposals either withoutmodification or with such modifications as, after consulting the authority, heconsiders appropriate, and may by order make provision for and inconnection with the implementation of the scheme in relation to thoseelections he considers appropriate. Once elections under the scheme havetaken place, the authority concerned must prepare a report on the scheme,detailing its provisions and assessing the scheme’s success or otherwise infacilitating voting at the elections in question and, if relevant, the counting ofvotes, or in encouraging voting at the elections in question or enabling votersto make informed decisions at those elections. 
A copy of the report must be sent to the Secretary of State, and published
in the relevant area, by the end of the period of three months beginning withthe date of the declaration of the result. If it appears to the Secretary of Statethat it would be desirable for provision to be made to apply generally and ona permanent basis to local government elections in England and Wales, hemay by order make such provision as he considers appropriate, which powerincludes the power to modify or disapply any provision of an Act ofParliament including the 2000 Act. Such an order must be made by statutoryinstrument, and laid before and approved by a resolution of each House ofParliament.

THE ELECTION OF COUNCILLORS
Councillors are elected for a four year term of office and represent ‘wards’
within the local government area. In metropolitan districts, one third ofcouncillors retire each year, other than in a year in which there will be countycouncil elections. In other, non-metropolitan districts, councillors retire everyfour years, or may choose to adopt the metropolitan model. The electoralsystem reflects that used for general elections, being the simple majority or‘first past the post’ system.
Detailed rules regulate election expenditure and, as with general elections,
a number of corrupt and illegal practices are proscribed. An election challengemay be presented by way of a petition to the Queen’s Bench Division of theHigh Court.
135The petition is heard by the election courts which consists of a
commissioner appointed by the judges who are nominated to try electionpetitions.
Qualification and disqualification for election
A candidate must – unlike candidates for parliament – be able to demonstratea close connection with the locality. Accordingly, he or she must either be onthe local register of electors, or have been resident or occupied property orhave his place of employment within the local authority area for a 12 monthperiod preceding ‘nomination day’.
136Bankruptcy, conviction for corrupt or
illegal practices, a conviction and sentence of three months’ imprisonmentwithin five years of the election or the imposition of a surcharge by the AuditCommission for unlawful local government expenditure
137will all disqualify
a person from standing for election. 
The fact of regular local elections during the life of a parliament enables
the people not only to express their preferences for those who will governthem until the next set of local elections, but also to express their approval ordisapproval of central government policies. In the May 1995, local elections, inwhich the Conservative Party lost control of a large number of local councils,the Conservative government was given a clear indication of the people’sjudgment on its stewardship of power.

services. Under sections 94–98 of the Local Government Act 1972, Councillors
must disclose the existence of any direct or indirect financial interest in councilbusiness. In 1974, following a scandal involving councillors in the North ofEngland concerning contracts for a private architect, John Poulson, officialinquiries were launched into the standard of conduct in public life.
139While it
was found that, in general, local government members’ conduct was ‘honest’,a number of reforms have been introduced. A statutory Register of Members’Interests has been established
140and a Code of Conduct introduced relating
to non-pecuniary interests.
The conduct of local government came under review from the Committee
of Standards in Public Life, chaired by Lord Nolan.141The inquiry examined
the ‘seven principles of public life’ – selflessness, integrity, objectivity,accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – identified by theCommittee in its inquiries to parliamentary standards. Lord Nolan’s frame ofreference included the issue of the manner in which, and extent to which, localgovernment operates these principles. Moreover, the Committee examinedcodes of conduct, including the declaration of financial and non-pecuniaryinterests; the role of councillors and officers of local authorities; the role ofauditors and ombudsmen; the relationships between councils and contractorsand/or consultants; the management of planning permissions; local authorityallowances and access to information by the public into local authority work.
Part III of the Local Government Act 2000 relates to standards of conduct
in local government, and empowers the Secretary of State to specify theprinciples which are to govern the conduct of members of relevant authoritiesin England in a model code. In relation to Wales, the National Assembly mayspecify standards. Local authorities will be under a duty to adopt a code ofconduct, and incorporate such mandatory provisions of a model code asapply to that authority. Every local authority, other than a parish council orcommunity council, must establish a standards committee,
142the functions of
which are to promote and maintain high standards of conduct and assistmembers of the authority to observe the code of conduct. The standardscommittee also has power to advise the authority on the adoption or revisionof a code, monitoring the operation of the code, and advising, training orarranging to train members of the authority in relation to the code of conduct.Adjudication tribunals are to be established to consider allegations of non-compliance with the code, and to report to the standards committee. Everylocal authority must establish and maintain a register of members’ interests.

THE MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT144
Unlike central government, there is no ‘cabinet’ which formulates policy. All
councils employ officers, some of which are required to be appointed understatute.
145Officials hold office on ‘such reasonable terms and conditions,
including conditions as to remuneration’ at the discretion of the council.146
Local authorities appoint a salaried chief officer or executive and employsenior administrators, clerical officers and secretarial and office staff. Inaddition, a local authority will employ teachers, police and firemen andpersonnel related to their specific services.
147
Local authorities have some discretion to decide on their management
arrangements.148For the most part, committees undertake the majority of
decision making, with their decisions being ratified by a meeting of the fullcouncil which may meet as frequently as the council thinks fit. By law,councils are required to have at least one annual meeting, but in practice theseare usually far more frequent. 
Meetings of the council must be publicised
149and council meetings150are
open to the public, unless the council rules that the meeting should beconducted in private because of the confidential nature of the business.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 2000
The Local Government Act 2000 provides for new executive arrangements tobe introduced into local government, and empowers a local authority todecide whether to introduce the executive arrangements.
152 The
arrangements consist of an elected mayor and two or more councillors of theauthority appointed by the elected mayor to the executive. The Executive is tobe referred to as the Mayor and Cabinet Executive. Part II of the Actintroduces a further layer of management to local government, and is subjectto the approval of electors expressed at a referendum. Where a local authority,with referendum approval, introduces an executive, the Secretary of State mayby regulations provide for any functions of a local authority to be theresponsibility of the Executive. Every local authority must draw up proposalsfor the operation of executive arrangements and send a copy of the proposals

147 In 1997, local government employed some 2.5 million persons.148 Under statute, however, certain committees must be established, eg, an Education
Committee, Police Committee and Social Service Committee.

to the Secretary of State. The proposals must indicate the form the executive is
to take, having consulted local government electors and other interestedpersons. Where the executive arrangement include a mayor and cabinetexecutive a referendum is required. In other cases, where a referendum is notrequired, the authority must implement the proposals in accordance with atimetable included in the proposals. The Secretary of State may direct a localauthority to hold a referendum in relation to the election of a mayor andexecutive cabinet.
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT153
Parliament is supreme and can control both the structure of local government,and the extent of local government powers and functions. The major forms ofcontrol are through general legislation and through delegated legislation.Local authorities have statutory power to make bylaws but these are subject toconfirmation by the minister. Central government policy and standard-settingcontrol the manner in which local authorities may exercise their powers.Schemes for town planning, transport and education must have centralapproval and, in town planning, appeals will ultimately lie to the Secretary ofState, and his approval will be needed in relation to compulsory purchaseorders. In relation to fire, education and the police, regular inspections aremade by central government inspectors.
The Department of State most closely associated with local government is
the Department of the Environment, created in 1970. There are also otherdepartments such as the Department of Education and Employment, theHome Office,
154and the Social Security Department which have powers over
local government. 
Financial controls over local government
In order to understand the current status of local government and itsrelationship with central government, it is necessary to understand the recenthistory of local government finance, which is one characterised by increasingcontrols being imposed by central government. The Royal Commission onLocal Government, 1966–69, discussed finance but made no proposals forchange in financial arrangements. The genesis of increased control on localgovernment spending by central government generally can be seen in the1970s under the Labour government. The oil crisis of 1973 increasedgovernment alarm over public spending in general. In 1976–77, thegovernment fixed grants at a level of projected price levels for the financialyear without any adjustment for inflation. Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

approval of bylaws.

Regional and Local Government
Throughout the 1979 general election campaign, ministers criticised local
government as wasteful, irresponsible and unaccountable. The Conservative
Party came into government promising reform of the rating system and addedto its promises the commitment to introduce a fairer and more simple grantsystem.
Local government revenue155
Some 60 per cent of local government revenue comes from centralgovernment grants. These are either specific grants – for example, forparticular services such as fire or police (50 per cent), or general grants – acentral government contribution to local authority funds. In addition, localauthorities may borrow money, subject to strict control by the Treasury, andraise money from the imposition of charges, for example, for services(swimming pools and recreational facilities) and the sale of council houses, fortransport services.
The financial needs of local government are thus met by a mixture of local
and central revenues. In terms of local revenue, from around 1600 until 1988,local domestic rates had been in existence. The rates, calculated according tothe value of the property, were cheap and easy to collect, and the public wereused to them. Rates applied to a property irrespective of the number ofpersons living in it. During the 1960s and 1970s, high spending councils led topressure for reform of the rating system. As the position stood then, a localauthority raised the annual local rates and central government, through theRate Support Grant – a ‘top-up’ grant – provided the short-fall betweenrevenue and expenditure. 
By 1974, the Conservative Party was committed to abolishing local rates.
The community charge, or Poll Tax, found favour with the government andwas introduced – amidst widespread public disorder – under the LocalGovernment Finance Act 1988. The same rate within a local authority areawould apply to every person: it was a person based rather than propertybased tax. Accordingly, each resident in a local area would contribute to thecosts of services which were enjoyed by all. Equally, such a tax would ensurethat each voter in the area felt the impact of local authority spending and,accordingly, the local authority would be more accountable to the voters. Inaddition to that personal tax, the government was keen to reform businessrates, and introduced the National Non-Domestic Rate, to be set bygovernment and outside local authority control.
The conflict and disquiet over the introduction of the community charge
led to rapid reform.
156Whilst in principle the tax would serve the needs of

156 Local Government Finance Act 1992.

fairness and accountability, in practice, the tax was rapidly regarded as
iniquitous and, as a result, uncollectable. The backtrack once again centred onproperty values. From 1993, the council tax payable is based on values ofproperty within differing price bands and is payable irrespective of thenumbers of people living within the house although, to mitigate the perceivedunfairness of the old rating system, a 25 per cent discount is allowable forsingle person households. 
Local authority expenditure
Before 1980, the Rate Support Grant was designed to top up the needs of alocal authority where the income from domestic rates fell short of theirexpenditure requirements. The sum payable by central government annuallywas fixed by the Secretary of State for the Environment following discussionwith local authority associations. Prior to the Local Government Planning andLand Act 1980, the majority of the grant was based on what was needed: andwhat was needed was dependent upon the local authorities’ perception ofneed. By the 1970s, the Conservative Party had come to the view that localgovernment was ‘profligate, wasteful and out of control’. The result was theintroduction
157of a new Block Grant, distributed according to grant related
expenditure assessments (GREAs) and those were to be determined bycentral, and not local, government. Overspending councils were to bepenalised by a grant taper. Simply expressed, the taper represented areduction in the central government grant where the Secretary of Stateconsidered that a local authority was spending too much. By 1981, it wasrealised by the government that this initiative was ineffective. Accordingly,the government introduced the grant holdback.
158Henceforth, overspending
local authorities were to have their grant withheld. In order to prevent thelocal authority from simply levying a mid term supplementary rate to makeup the short fall, the right to impose a supplementary rate was removed.However, these controls also proved ineffective. In order to circumvent theconsequences of grant being withheld, some local authorities increased theamount of the annual rate levied to make up the short fall. The Rates Act 1984introduced further central government powers: those of rate capping. Ratecapping sought to prevent rate increases above a target set by centralgovernment, and conferred a broad discretion on the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to impose sanctions. Those opposed to rate capping claimed thatit represented an interference in local government affairs and an erosion oflocal democracy. For each one per cent of overspend, the offending localauthority would lose a proportion of its allowable rate figure. Chapter 12: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Regional and Local Government
An illustration of the political conflict which ensued involved Liverpool
City Council. The City Council, a Labour Party controlled council, decided to
take illegal action to safeguard vital services, and set their own rate outsidethe limits set by government. Between 1985 and 1986, unemployment wasrunning at 27 per cent; the City Council had enough money for only ninemonths’ administration. The government refused to come to the CityCouncil’s assistance. The City Council resolved to close down for threemonths and to make employees redundant, while the Council was movingtowards bankruptcy. Eventually, the City Council set a legal rate financed,ironically, by Swiss banks. One response to such restraints by local authoritieswas the attempt to raise money through the financial markets in interestswaps. The House of Lords, however, ruled such transactions to be ultra
vires.
159
With the demise of the Poll Tax and introduction of the council tax in
1993,160came a change in the manner in which central government calculated
and allocated the Revenue Support Grant.161In an attempt to ensure standard
levels of service throughout the country, the Grant Related ExpenditureAllocation gave way to the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA). In brief, theDepartment of the Environment (DoE) calculates the level of resource whicheach local authority needs in order to achieve the ‘standard level of service’across the range of services which a local authority is statutorily required toprovide. In part, this figure is determined by the previous expenditure of thelocal authority. In calculating the resource needs, the DoE operates a formulabased on statistical data on each authority, comprising a number of variables,such as population, property prices, demographic factors, level of socialdeprivation and so on. Based on this, the DoE calculated the resource needs inrelation to particular services – education, social services, etc. The DoEcombines this calculation with the amount which it deems it appropriate for alocal authority to raise through the imposition of the council tax, and theamount which the local authority will be given from government from theNational Non-Domestic (Business) Rate (NNDR). The combination of theamount to be levied via the council tax plus the receipts from the NNDR,subtracted from the DoE’s assessment of resource need, equals thegovernment’s Revenue Support Grant for a particular authority. Over andabove that final calculation, and based on former expenditure, thegovernment set for each authority the percentage level at which the authorityis ‘capped’ – that is to say, the absolute maximum budget which that authoritywas permitted to spend in the financial year. If a local authority decided that itneeds to spend more than the cap figure, the revenue needed could only come

from an increase in local council tax. The government would not provide
monies over the cap, and local authorities exceeding the cap are liable to thefull range of penalties available under statute. 
The Local Government Act 1999
The Labour government entered power in 1997 with a pledge to reform localgovernment. The Local Government Act 1999 represented the first stage ofreform, removing the requirement of compulsory competitive tenderingimposed by the 1988 Local Government Act, and introducing the concept ofbest value (on which, see below), and amending the scheme of rate capping inplace under the 1992 Local Government Finance Act. The 1999 Act introducedgreater flexibility into the rate-capping mechanisms. Under the 1992 Act, localauthorities were classified according to type and the same principles appliedto all local authorities within a particular class, which prevented the particularcircumstances of individual authorities from being taken into considerationwhen making the decision in relation to capping. Section 30 and Schedule 1 tothe 1999 Act enable the Secretary of State to apply different capping principlesto individual authorities. The Act also introduces the power of the Secretary ofState to ‘nominate’ a local authority. The nomination power is one enablingthe Secretary of State to warn a local authority that its spending is becomingexcessive.
162Where an authority’s spending is becoming excessive, the
Secretary of State may either designate the authority or nominate theauthority.
163Where an authority is designated, the Secretary of State notifies
the authority of the amount which he proposes should be the maximum forthe amount calculated by the authority as its budget requirement for the year,and the target amount for the year which the Secretary of State proposes theauthority could calculate as its budget requirement for the year without theamount calculated being excessive.
164Where an authority is nominated, the
Secretary of State may decide to designate the authority for the followingfinancial year, or to set a notional sum for its budget requirement, againstwhich the authority’s budget requirement for the following year will becompared.

England and Wales is the principle body responsible for supervising local
government and heal service audits. The Commission consists of not less than15 and not more than 20 members appointed by the Secretary of State.
167The
accounts of bodies subject to the Act are required to be compiled at the end ofMarch annually and audited by auditors appointed by the Commission.
168
The Commission is responsible for preparing and keeping under review a
Code of Audit Practice. Auditors have a right of access to every documentrelating to a body which appears to him necessary for the purposes of hisfunctions under the Act. It is an offence to fail to comply, without reasonableexcuse, with any requirement of the auditor.

If in the course of an audit of a local government body, other than a health
service body, that an item of account is contrary to law and has not beensanctioned by the Secretary of State, the auditor may apply to High Court fora declaration that the item is contrary to law.
170If the High Court makes such
a declaration, it may also require the responsible person to repay the unlawfulexpenditure in whole or in part. If the unlawful expenditure exceeds £2,000,and at the time the person responsible was a member of a local authority, theCourt may order him to be disqualified from being a member of a localauthority for a specified period and may order rectification of the accounts.The High Court must not make an order if it is satisfied that the responsibleperson ‘acted reasonably or in the belief that the expenditure was authorisedby law’, and in any other case shall ‘have regard to all the circumstances,including that person’s means and ability to repay the expenditure or any partof it.
171If a person has failed to bring into account a sum, and that failure has
not been sanctioned by the Secretary of State and a ‘loss has been incurred ordeficiency caused by the wilful misconduct of any person’ the auditor mustcertify that the sum, or the amount of the loss or deficiency, is due from thatperson.
172Wilful misconduct has been held to include the failure to collect
fees which were due,173and a delay in setting the rate resulting in the
authority losing interest on money which would otherwise have beencollected.
174A person aggrieved by the auditor’s decision to certify a sum or
amount due may appeal to the High Court.175In relation to health service

176If the authority’s chief finance officer has already made a
report on unlawful expenditure,177no prohibition order may be made in
relation to the period covered by the report. Where a prohibition order isissued, it is not lawful for the body concerned to make or implement therelevant decision or undertake the course of action to which the prohibitionorder relates.

to form one part of the government’s quest for value and efficiency in the
provision of local authority services. Section 1 defines the local authorities towhich the best value duty will apply, which extends beyond local authoritiesproper and includes such bodies as the police authorities, Transport forLondon and other metropolitan transport authorities, waste disposalauthorities, fire authorities and the London Development Agency.
The general duty imposed on best value authorities is to ‘make
arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which itsfunctions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiencyand effectiveness’. In deciding how to fulfil its duty under section 3,authorities must consult local tax payers, service users and representatives ofpersons appearing to have an interest in any area in which the authoritycarries out functions. The Secretary of State may by order specify factors‘performance indicators’ by reference to which best value authority’sperformance can be measured and standards ‘performance standards’ to bemet in relation to the performance indicators. Differing performanceindicators or standards may be set for different functions and differentfunctions and may apply at different times
.182A best value authority must
conduct reviews of its functions with the aim to improving the way itsfunctions are exercised, and the Secretary of State may by order specifymatters which an authority must include in a review of functions. Inparticular an order may require an authority to consider whether it shouldcarry out a particular function, the level at which it should be exercising thefunction, and its objectives in relation to the exercise of the function. It shouldalso assess its performance, and the competitiveness of its performance byreference to other best value authorities and by commercial or otherbusinesses, and consult other authorities and commercial operations about theexercise of the function. It must also assess its progress towards meetingperformance standards, which have been specified.
183
Each authority must prepare a best value performance plan for each
financial year, and the Secretary of State may by order specify matters whichan authority must include in its plan.
184The performance plan published for a
financial year is to be audited by the authority’s auditor.185The authority
must respond to the auditor’s report, and where recommendations have beenmade, must make a statement of action it intends to take as a result of thereport and its proposed timetable, within 30 days of receiving the report orearlier if the report so specifies.

inspectors have a right of access and may require responsible persons to give
such information, explanation or documentation as is required.187Where an
inspection has been carried out, the Audit Commission must issue a reportstipulating areas in which the Commission believes the authority is failing tocomply with requirements and may recommend that the Secretary of Stategive directions to the authority. Where the Commission issues a report statingfailure to comply with requirements, the authority must, in its nextperformance plan, record that fact and any action taken by the authority as aresult of the report.
188Under section 15, the Secretary of State has the power
to intervene where he or she is satisfied that an authority is failing to meet therequirements relating to best value. The Secretary of State may require anauthority to amend a performance plan, to follow specified procedures inrelation to the plan and to carry out a review of its exercise of specifiedfunctions. The Secretary of State may also direct a local inquiry to be held inrelation to the exercise of functions.
Section 15 also gives to the Secretary of State the power to direct an
authority to take any action which he considers necessary or expedient tosecure compliance with best value requirements. The Secretary of State maydirect that a specified function of an authority shall be exercised by theSecretary of State or a person nominated by him, thereby removing thatfunction, for the period specified, from the authority.

of State takes over the function of an authority, regulations may be made toavoid the situation where, for example, planning functions have been takenover. The Secretary of State is also the final arbiter of an appeal against thatplanning decision.

Complaints against local government may be made to the authority itself and,if such a complaint does not receive satisfactory treatment, a complaint maybe made to the Commissioner for Local Administration. The jurisdiction, roleand powers of Commissioners for Administration are considered in Chapter26.
The reforms introduced after 1980 radically altered the role of local
government.

Regional and Local Government
Conservative government’s tenure of office, severely reduced the traditional
role of local authorities and altered the balance of power between central andlocal government. 
While the role and function of local government is defined, controlled and
restrained by central government, local government must also be seen withinthe wider context of the European Union and Community. Since the UnitedKingdom acceded to the European Community in 1973, and the formation ofthe European Union under the Treaty on European Union 1992, an increasingvolume of European law affects not only the legislative sphere of competenceof parliament in relation to matters within the competence of the Union, butalso affects both national and local policies and standards. The Communitywas founded on the four freedoms – of persons, goods, capital and services –which affect all levels of government. In addition, the community and Unionhas expanded its sphere of competence over the years to include such diversematters as environmental protection, health and hygiene standards andweights and measures. Many of the Community laws on these areas fall onlocal authorities to implement. The freedom of movement and right ofestablishment of European citizens
191has implications for local authority

The European Union’s relationship to local government is not limited to
the imposition of regulations and directives imposing duties on localauthorities, but extends to the provision of regional aid. The Committee of theRegions of the European Union
192provides the means by which the views
and interests of local authorities may be taken into account. Furthermore, theprovision of financial aids and grants through the Social Fund, EuropeanInvestment Bank and Regional Development Fund provides an additionalsource of finance for local authorities.
Local government and the courts
Local authorities, being bodies to whom powers are delegated by parliament,may exercise their powers and spend money only for the purposes authorisedby statute. In order to ensure that bodies with delegated law making,administrative and/or judicial powers act within those powers ( intra vires ),
the courts are seized with jurisdiction to review any action challenged by aperson or body aggrieved by that action. Applications for judicial reviewproceed by way of an application for leave to apply for judicial review.Applicants must have sufficient interest ( locus standi) in the matter to apply,
and the matter challenged must be one falling under public law as opposed to

private law. Furthermore, the matter must be one which is justiciable, that is
to say, a matter which the courts deem themselves to be the appropriate bodyto adjudicate on the matter.
193
Local government is a regular participant in judicial review proceedings.
As seen earlier, all the powers which they exercise are powers delegated bystatute; local authorities have no inherent jurisdiction. Accordingly, the courtsmay rule on the ‘ vires’ of their activities. Judicial review is considered in
Chapters 24 and 25 and those chapters should be consulted for discussion ofthe case law. In relation to control over the exercise of local governmentpowers, the courts employ the concept of fiduciary duty. Local government isin a fiduciary position of trustee of resources to be exercised for the benefit ofthe consumers of those resources, council tax payers.

CHAPTER 13
The first variety of democracy is that which is so called because it is based
chiefly on the principle of equality. In such a democracy, the law interpretsequality as meaning that the poor shall not enjoy any more advantage than therich, that neither shall be sovereign, but both shall be exactly similar. For if, asis held by some, freedom is especially to be found in democracy, and alsoequality, this condition is most fully realised when all alike share most fully inthe constitution. But, since the people are a majority, and the decision of themajority is sovereign, this must be a democracy.
1
INTRODUCTION
In a democratic state, the electoral process exercises determining power over
those who hold political office. It is the electorate which confers the power togovern and calls government to account. If the electorate is to enjoy trueequality in constitutional participation, it is of fundamental constitutionalimportance that the electoral system ensures four principles:
(a) that there is a full franchise, subject to limited restrictions; (b) that the value of each vote cast is equal to that of every other vote; 
(c) that the conduct of election campaigns is regulated to ensure legality and
fairness; 
(d) that the voting system is such as to produce both a legislative body
representative of the electorate and a government with sufficient
democratic support to be able to govern effectively. 
It is against these four principal objectives that the law must be evaluated.However, it must be recognised that these elements are in large measureinseparable from each other. Each aspect of the electoral process combines toform a system:
Any code of electoral law includes a number of essential sections of almost
equal importance ... Each of these sections is meaningless in isolation from theothers. A wide and equal suffrage loses its value if political bosses are able togerrymander constituencies so as to suit their own interests; there is no point inhaving an elaborate system of proportional representation if the electors are alldriven in one direction by a preponderance of bribes and threats; legalprovisions mean nothing if enforcement is left wholly in the hands of thosewho profit by breaking it.
423THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM
1 Aristotle, The Politics , Bk iv, 1291b30.

That is why it is right to speak of the ‘electoral system’. Procedure for elections
is systematic in that its parts are interdependent; it is impossible to advance onone ‘front’ without regard to others.

THE FRANCHISE3
Evolution of the franchise
Prior to the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, the right to vote was limited and
based on rights in property. The 1832 Act – the Representation of the PeopleAct – increased the franchise by 50 per cent, which represented only seven percent of the population. The Reform Act of 1867 doubled the number of peopleentitled to vote. The debate as to who should participate in the franchise goesback to ancient Greece. Aristotle argued for maximum involvement of allcitizens in the decision making processes of the City State, arguing inter alia
that, while the individual citizen acting alone may be of unsound judgment,decisions reached collectively will be better – or at any rate no worse – thanthose made by ‘experts’.
4
In Great Britain, the right to vote – by the nineteenth century – was based
on property holdings. Men without property, and all women, were excludedfrom the franchise. The extension of the franchise in 1867 to skilled andunskilled male labourers was not a matter greeted with universal approval.Walter Bagehot retorted that:
... no one will contend that the ordinary working man who has no special skill,
and who is only rated because he has a house, can judge much of intellectualmatters. [(1867) 1993, p 273]
Bagehot feared the potential power of the working class: should they combine
as a class, the ‘higher orders’ might have to consider whether to concede totheir demands or ‘risk the effect of the working men’s combination’ (p 278).
Women and the right to vote
Women were to remain disenfranchised until 1928, but the movement forwomen’s right to vote predates the 1867 Act.
5In 1851, Harriet Taylor Mill had
published Enfranchisement of Women in the Westminster Review . In 1886, John
Stuart Mill6presented a petition to parliament calling for the enfranchisement
of women. The following year, the Manchester Women’s Suffrage Committeewas formed, soon to be united in a National Committee based in London.Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Electoral System
When the Reform Bill was before parliament, John Stuart Mill introduced an
amendment – changing the word ‘man’ to ‘person’ – thereby entitling womento vote. The amendment was defeated. 
A legal challenge to disenfranchisement came in Chorlton v Lings (1868). It
was argued before the Court of Common Pleas that the Representation of thePeople Act 1867 had conferred on women a right to vote. The argumentcentred on the use of the word ‘man’ in the Act. It was contended that LordBrougham’s Act which stipulated that the word ‘man’ included ‘women’applied to an interpretation of the Representation of the People Act. Bovill CJrejected such a view:
The conclusion at which I have arrived is, that the legislature used the word
‘man’ in the Act of 1867 in the same sense as ‘male person’ in the former Act;that this word was intentionally used, in order to designate expressly the malesex; and that it amounts to an express enactment and provision that everyman, as distinguished from women, possessing the qualification, is to have thefranchise. In that view, Lord Brougham’s Act does not apply to the presentcase, and does not extend the meaning of the word ‘man’ so as to includewomen. [p 387]
Mr Justice Willis, Byles J and Keating J agreed. In accepting Bovill CJ’s
interpretation, Willis J turned to comment on the wider issue. In declaringhimself opposed to any view that women were excluded from the franchiseon the basis of ‘fickleness of judgment and liability to influence’, which wouldbe quite inconsistent ‘with one of the glories of our civilisation – the respectand honour in which women are held’, Willis J declared, concerning theprohibition against voting – and the prohibition against peeresses in theHouse of Lords – that ‘out of respect to women, and a sense of decorum, andnot from their want of intellect, or their being for any other reason unfit totake part in the government of the country, they have been excused fromtaking any share in this department of public affairs’ (p 392).
In 1869, Mill published The Subjection of Women. The right to vote was but
one campaign. Women were also seeking equal rights in education, in politicsand in the medical profession. In 1897, the differing suffrage movements wereto be united under the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies. By1913, the number of affiliated societies had reached 400. The leadership ofEmmeline and Christabel Pankhurst injected new energy into the campaignand the age of militancy in support of the right to vote began. The tide ofpublic opinion started to turn in women’s favour in 1909, when the authoritiesstarted to force feed hunger striking suffragettes imprisoned as a result oftheir campaign. A Bill to give women the right to vote passed second readingin 1910, but was defeated by the Prime Minister, Asquith, acting in concertwith Lloyd George, the Opposition Leader. The failure of a second Bill in 1911sparked violent protest all over London: 217 women were arrested. A Bill of1913 met with a similar fate and reaction. Fearful of the consequences ofimprisonment and hunger strikes, the government passed the ‘Cat and
425

Mouse’ Act,7which enabled the authorities to release hunger striking
prisoners who were in medical danger and re-arrest them on their physical
recovery.
The persistence of the suffragettes, combined with the involvement of
women in industry during the 1914–18 World War, acted as catalysts forwinning the right to vote. In 1916, an all-party conference on electoral reformwas established under the chairmanship of the Speaker of the House ofCommons. 
The Representation of the People Act 1918, which implemented the
conference’s proposals, introduced a full franchise of all men in parliamentaryelections and conferred the right to vote in parliament on all women over theage of 30 who were either local government electors or the wives of localgovernment electors.
8Full equality with men was delayed until 1928. A full
franchise, on the basis of equality, and respecting the principle of ‘one person,one vote’, was finally achieved under the Representation of the People Act1948.
The current franchise
The right to vote is defined in the Representation of the People Act 1983, asamended. Prior to enactment of the Representation of the People Act 2000,eligibility was based solely on residency in a constituency at a ‘qualifyingdate’.
9The 2000 Act introduces greater flexibility, allowing registration once
resident in a constituency at any date. The Representation of the People Act2000 extends the right to vote in both parliamentary elections and localgovernment elections by supplementing the residency requirement withregistration on the register of parliamentary electors for that constituency(sections 1 and 2, substituting the same sections of the 1983 Act). In addition, aperson’s eligibility depends on citizenship,
10voting age (now 18 years and
over),11and not being subject to any legal incapacity — including minors
(those under the age of 18), aliens, peers other than Irish peers, mental patientswho are compulsorily detained,
12convicted persons in detention13and, for a
period of five years, anyone found guilty of election offences.14Section 2 ofChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

8 In addition, the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 provided that: ‘A
woman shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from being elected to or sitting or
voting as a Member of the Commons House of Parliament.’

10 In relation to parliamentary elections, relevant citizenship is British citizenship, a
qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. In relation to
local government elections, relevant citizens of the European Union are also eligible tovote: Representation of the People Act 1984, ss 1, 2 and 4; as amended by theRepresentation of the People Act 2000, ss 1, 2 and 4.

Section 5 of the 1983 Act defined ‘residence’ for the purposes of inclusion
on the electoral register. Section 3 of the 2000 Act extends those requirements.Section 6 of the 2000 Act
15extends eligibility to vote in parliamentary or local
elections, other than for those disenfranchised by virtue of mental incapacityor detention pursuant to criminal conviction, to those who have no fixedresidence, through ‘declarations of local connection’. A declaration of localconnection must state the name of the declarant and either an address towhich election correspondence can be delivered, or that he or she is willing tocollect such correspondence periodically from the registration officer’s office.The declaration must state the required address and also be dated, and, on thedate of declaration, the declarant must also be otherwise qualified to vote byvirtue of relevant citizenship and age. A declaration of local connection maybe cancelled at any time by the declarant. The declaration is of no effect unlessit is received by the relevant registration officer within the period of threemonths beginning with the date of the declaration.

Constituencies
The United Kingdom is divided for electoral purposes into 659 constituencies,or voting areas. Each constituency is represented in parliament by just onemember, who has secured a majority of votes in a general election or by-election.

The principle of ‘one man, one vote, one value’ is given formal recognition inthe rules regulating the work of the Boundary Commissions
18contained in
the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986,19which consolidates the House of
Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts 1949–79. Equality is not, however, aswill be seen below, the sole, or even dominant, criterion. By way ofcomparison, in the United States of America, the principle was judiciallyconsidered by the Supreme Court in Baker v Carr , in 1962. In that case, the

principle was regarded as of such constitutional importance that the Supreme
Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution – the ‘equalprotection’ clause – required that electoral districts had to have anapproximately equal number of electors to prevent over or under-representation and inequality in voting power.
The rules regulating the work of the Commissions are contained in
Schedule 2 of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, from which it can beseen that the principle of ‘one man, one vote, one value’ is, under the UnitedKingdom’s constitution, but one of several considerations. Schedule 2provides, in part, that:
1 (i) The number of constituencies in Great Britain shall not be substantially
greater or less than 613;
(ii) the number of constituencies in Scotland shall not be less than 71;20
(iii) the number of constituencies in Wales shall not be less than 35;
(iv) the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland shall not be greater
than 18 or less than 16 ...
2 Every constituency shall return a single member.
... 
4 So far as is practicable, having regard to rules 1–3: 
(a) in England and Wales, 
(i) no county or part of a county shall be included in a constituency
which includes the whole or part of any other county or the whole
or part of a London borough;
(ii) no London borough or any part of a London borough shall be
included in a constituency which includes the whole or part of anyother London borough.
5 The electorate of any constituency shall be as near the electoral quota as is
practicable having regard to rules 1–4; and a Boundary Commission maydepart from the strict application of rule 4 if it appears to them that adeparture is desirable to avoid an excessive disparity between theelectorate of any constituency and the electoral quota, or between theelectorate of any constituency and that of neighbouring constituencies inthe part of the United Kingdom with which they are concerned.
6 A Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application of rules 4
and 5 if special geographical considerations, including in particular thesize, shape and accessibility of a constituency, appear to them to render adeparture desirable.
The target figure for constituency electorates is based on the simple division of
the eligible voting population in the country divided by the number ofconstituencies. The Commission aims to achieve a result which brings themajority of constituencies within a narrow band of this target figure, bearingin mind the other criteria contained within the rules.Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law
42820 The Scotland Act 1998 removes this minimum figure. In future, Scottish representation
at Westminster will be calculated on the basis of population.

The Electoral System
Legal challenges to Boundary Commission reports
The political difficulties – generally the loss of a number of ‘safe’ seats by one
party – which arise from boundary changes have given rise to challenges inthe courts. In R v Home Secretary ex parte McWhirter (1969), the Labour Party
feared the loss of up to ten constituencies as a result of the Commission’srecommendations. The Home Secretary laid the report before parliament,without the draft Orders in Council which were necessary to implement thechanges. The reason given for failure to produce the draft Orders was that itmade little sense to implement changes, given that local governmentboundaries were under review at the time.
The Home Secretary introduced the House of Commons Redistribution of
Seats Bill, implementing some of the recommendations regarding large urbanareas, but not the remaining recommendations. The House of Lordsintroduced amendments, which the Home Secretary rejected. The HomeSecretary then suggested compromise amendments, which the House ofLords rejected. Subsequently, the Home Secretary introduced the draft Ordersin Council, leaving the Lords’ amendments intact, but inviting the House ofCommons to reject the Orders. The application for mandamus waswithdrawn. In 1970, however, the incoming Conservative governmentreintroduced and passed the Orders.
In R v Boundary Commission for England ex parte Foot (1983), the Labour
Party, having been aggrieved by the Boundary Commission’srecommendations, instituted legal proceedings. The Rt Hon Michael Foot MPsought an order of prohibition and injunctions to restrain the Commissionfrom putting the recommendations to the Home Secretary, alleging that theCommission had misinterpreted the rules.
21The court rejected the argument,
relying on the considerable discretion built into the rules by the ParliamentaryConstituencies Act. Sir John Donaldson MR, having referred to theconstitutional role of judicial review, and accepted that jurisdiction lay toreview the decision of the Boundary Commission stated that unless there wassufficient evidence that:
... the commission is intent upon making recommendations which go beyond,
or differ from, what any reasonable body of men in their position couldproperly make, exercising the best of their skill and judgment in the light of theinstructions given to them by Parliament ... the court’s duty to leave thecommission to get on with the process entrusted to them, that being theirbusiness and not that of the courts.
On the relationship between the different rules within Schedule 2 of the Act,
the Master of the Rolls stated that:
... the guidelines designed to achieve the broad equality of electorates, which
are to be found in the opening limb of rule 5, have been deliberately expressed
42921 Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, Sched 2.

by the legislature in such a manner as to render them subordinate to the
guidelines given by rule 4, designed to prevent the crossing of boundaries andnot vice versa ... Even if a strict adherence to the principles of rule 4 willproduce what is a prima facie excessive disparity between the electorate of any
constituency and the electoral quota, the wording of the second limb of rule 5implicitly makes it clear that the commission are to be left with a discretion notto depart from the strict application of rule 4 if, in all the particularcircumstances of the case, they consider such departure undesirable ... From abare reference to the statistics in the present case, we see no reason to assumethat the commission did not, consciously and on sufficient grounds, concludethat departure from the strict application of rule 4 was not desirable in any ofthe particular cases where ‘excessive disparity’ is alleged.
Secondly, and quite apart from this first reason, rule 6 expressly confers on the
commission a discretion to depart from the strict application of either rule 4 orrule 5 itself, if special geographical considerations, including in particular thesize, shape and accessibility of a constituency, appear to them to render adeparture desirable. 
The reluctant attitude of the courts towards controlling the Boundary
Commissions’ exercise of power is understandable, given the politicallycharged nature of the subject matter. Judicial inquiry in this matter comesvery close to questioning a matter which is more appropriately dealt with inparliament, and to thereby infringing the privileges of parliament.
22
Nevertheless, such an attitude is thrown into sharp relief when comparedwith the position in the United States of America, where the constitutionalguarantee of ‘the equal protection of the law’
23has been utilised to ensure real
equality in voting power. As noted above, in Baker v Carr (1962), the Supreme
Court held that such inequality (as is permitted under United Kingdom law)was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees the equalprotection of the law. 
In Australia, a system of determining boundary sizes exists for each of the
state parliaments and for the Commonwealth Parliament. Under theCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth), the Electoral Commission is under aduty to undertake a reassessment of the allocation of seats between the statesbetween 11 and 12 months after the opening of the House of Representativesfollowing a general election, in order that the review may be completed andrecommendations implemented and ‘available for use at the next election’. Inrelation to the House of Representatives, section 24 of the CommonwealthConstitution states: 
... that the number of members chosen in the several states shall be in
proportion to the respective numbers of their people. It has been held that thisquestion of proportionality is to exist on each occasion when the members arechosen, that is, at each time an election is held.

The Electoral System
Any legislation which impedes the review or implementation of its
recommendations is invalid.25Despite these requirements, it has been held
that total equality was not the objective. Rather, equality was to be measuredon a scale of deviation from absolute equality: a ten per cent variance wouldnot contravene the requirements of section 24, whereas one of over 100 percent clearly would.
26The Constitutional Commission reviewing electoral law
in 1988, while acknowledging the fundamental importance of ‘one vote, onevalue’, nevertheless conceded that such variation was acceptable.
27
Reform of the Boundary Commissions
A number of criticisms were levelled at the arrangements concerning thenumber and size of constituencies. The first related to the inherent conflict inprinciples enshrined in the legislation. The principle of equality inconstituency size and hence voting power is too often sacrificed to therequirement to respect local government boundaries and to have regard tospecial geographical considerations. The second criticism related to the time-lag between the enumeration date for the Commissions’ reviews and theultimate report and recommendations. Were the Commissions required tocomplete their reviews on a fixed date and within a prescribed period fromthat date this problem could be alleviated. Professor Robert Blackburnaddressed this issue in The Electoral System in Britain (1995), calling for reforms
which would require the Commissions to complete their work within a twoyear period from the fixed date of report. Not only would this reformdiminish the problem of population changes within the time taken tocomplete the review, but the fixed term for submission of the report wouldalso avoid much of the uncertainty which surrounds the implementation ofboundary changes, and encourages party political controversy. 
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 establishes anElectoral Commission, comprising not less than five but not more than nineElectoral Commissioners, appointed by Her Majesty. The Commission is notto be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown, or as enjoying any status,immunity or privilege of the Crown. Schedule 1 makes detailed provision forthe terms of office. The Commission regulates its own procedure, and mayappoint a chief executive and such other staff as the Commission considersnecessary.
The Commission’s functions are set out in the 2000 Act. They include
preparing and publishing reports relating to parliamentary general elections

and elections to the European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, National
Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly.28The Commission must
keep under review such matters relating to elections and referendums as theCommission determines, the redistribution of seats at parliamentary elections,the registration of political parties and the regulation of their income andexpenditure and political advertising.
29The Commission assumes
responsibility for the registration of political parties.30No nomination may be
made in relation to an election in the name of a party unless that party isregistered, or the candidate is a person who does not propose to represent anyparty.
31
The Commission may provide advice and assistance in relation to
elections.32The Commission is also to be under a duty to promote public
awareness about electoral and democratic systems, including the institutionsof the European Union.
33The Act also provides that the functions of the
Boundary Committees, as they are labelled in the Act, are transferred to theElectoral Commission.
34Under Part II of the Act, the registration of political
parties falls under the Commission’s terms of reference, and Part III providesfor accounting requirements for registered parties, and provides for annualaudits for parties whose gross income or total expenditure exceeds £250,000 inany financial year, and in relation to those with less income or totalexpenditure, where the Commission requires an audit to be carried out.Failure to submit a proper statement of accounts incurs criminal liability.
There is established a Speaker’s Committee, consisting of the Speaker and
the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House ofCommons, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, whether or not aMember of the Commons, a member of the Commons who is the ministerwith responsibilities in relation to local government and five Members of theCommons who are not ministers.
35The Speaker’s Committee scrutinises the
annual estimates of the Commission, and decides whether the estimated levelof income and expenditure is consistent with the economical, efficient andeffective discharge by the Commission of their functions. If the Committee isnot satisfied, it may modify the estimates. Having concluded examination ofthe estimate, the estimate is laid before the House of Commons. TheCommission is also to submit to the Speaker’s Committee a five year plan,setting out the aims and objectives for the period and estimated requirementsfor resources during that five year period. The Speaker’s Committee examinesthe plan, and may make modifications. The Speaker’s Committee is assistedChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

INITIATING THE ELECTION PROCESS
General elections
General elections must be held every five years, the maximum life of anyparliament.
36Section 7 of the Septennial Act 1715, as amended by the
Parliament Act 1911, provides that a parliament shall ‘have continuance forfive years, and no longer ...’. A royal proclamation dissolves parliament andorders the issue of writs for the election of a new parliament. 
The Prime Minister controls the timing of general elections although, in
theory, the dissolution of parliament lies within the prerogative of the Crown.For detailed discussion of the dissolution of parliament, see Chapter 6. TheCrown’s powers in relation to the dissolution of parliament are discussed inChapter 6. Within the context of electoral law, what is of significance is theinexactitude relating to the actual date of a general election, and the extent towhich Prime Ministers control the timing of elections. While a parliament mayrun for a full five year term, there are often political reasons against this,which result in Prime Ministers choosing a politically convenient date for hisor her own party. While there is a maximum time limit on the life of aparliament, there is no minimum period which a government must servebefore calling an election.
37In 1974, for example, the parliament lasted less
than one year, whereas parliament’s life extended to four years and ninemonths between 1987 and 1992. In the absence of firm rules, Prime Ministersalso have latitude over the amount of notice which is given before the electionis held. 
By-elections
By-elections take place following the death or retirement of a Member ofParliament. Any Member of Parliament may put down a motion to the House,which if successful, orders the Speaker to make a warrant for the issue of awrit commencing the election procedure. In practice, the Chief Whip of theparty which held the seat of the Member moves the motion for a writ. There isa limit laid down by law as to the time period in which a by-election must be

held. In 1973, a Speaker’s Conference recommended that the motion initiating
the by-election process should be moved within three months of the vacancyarising.
Eligibility of candidates
There is no statutory or other authority defining the qualifications formembership of the House of Commons. In order to promote a greater genderbalance in parliament, the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002provides that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and Sex Discrimination(Northern Ireland) Order 1976 do not apply to the selection of candidates bypolitical parties. Under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975,certain categories of persons are eligible for election and others aredisqualified under the Act. 
Under section 1 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, the
following classes of persons are disqualified from membership of theCommons:
(a) holders of judicial office;
38
(b) civil servants;
(c) members of the armed forces;
(d) members of the police;(e) members of non-Commonwealth legislatures;
(f) members of Boards of Nationalised Industries, Commissions, Tribunals
and other bodies whose members are appointed by the Crown.

While the age of majority was reduced in 1969 by the Family Law Reform Act,
eligibility for election to parliament does not arise until the age of 21.40
Persons suffering from mental illness
Mental illness is a common law disqualification. If an already elected Memberof Parliament is authorised to be detained on grounds of mental illness, theSpeaker of the House is notified and, following confirmation of the illness, theMember’s seat is declared vacant.

Peers
Members of the House of Lords, or persons succeeding to a peerage, are noteligible for office. Under the Peerage Act 1963, a person succeeding to aChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

peerage has a limited right to disclaim his peerage. If a member of the House
of Commons succeeds to a peerage, he has one month in which to disclaim hispeerage or resign from the House of Commons. 
Members of the clergy
Formerly, no person who had been ordained ‘to the office of priest or deacon’or who is a Minister of the Church of Scotland could stand for election,
42
although a clergyman could relinquish his office and thereby become eligibleto stand for election.
43The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy
Disqualification) Act 2001 removes the disqualification, other than for thosewho hold office as Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords.
Bankrupts
Persons declared bankrupt are ineligible for election to the House ofCommons and, if already a Member, may not either sit or vote in parliamentuntil the bankruptcy is discharged by a court or the adjudication annulled.
44
Treason
Persons convicted of treason are disqualified for election to the House and, ifalready a Member of the House, may not sit or vote until a pardon has beenreceived or the sentence of the court has expired.
45
Corrupt practices at elections
Any person found guilty of corrupt practices in the course of an election maybe disqualified from membership of the House of Commons. If the corruptpractices come to light only after the election, the Member may be disqualifiedfrom sitting in parliament.
46The disqualification commences from the date of
the report of the Election Court on the practices and will last, in relation to anyconstituency, for a period of five years and, in relation to the constituency inwhich the practices occurred, for a ten year period. 
The conduct of election campaigns
The Representation of the People Act 1983 governs the law relating to electioncampaigns, controlling both the amounts of expenditure and the manner inwhich it can lawfully be spent, proscribing certain unlawful practices andproviding for challenges to the legality of a campaign. Corrupt practices

include exceeding the lawful expenditure limits, bribery, treating, and undue
influence which includes making threats or attempts to intimidate electors.47
A bribe is defined as ‘any money, gift, loan or valuable consideration, office,place or employment, in order to influence how an elector will cast his or hervote’.
48‘Treating’ occurs where a candidate offers or gives food, drink or
entertainment with a view to influencing how the elector will vote.49A
corrupt practice may be committed by any person, not just the candidate orhis or her election agent. While minor infringement of the strict rules may beexcused by a court,
50a finding of corrupt practices may cause the election of
the candidate to be invalidated.51
It may be noted that, before the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000, while the law closely regulated the conduct ofconstituency campaigns, it virtually ignored regulation of the nationalpolitical party campaigns. In an age of mass communication, and everincreasing personality politics in terms of political party leaders, the absenceof regulation at national level – other than via broadcasting controls – was amatter for concern. On the 2000 Act, see below.
The 2000 Act makes special provision for assistance with voting for
persons with disabilities, whether by virtue of partial sight, blindness or otherphysical incapacity or inability to read.
52
Expenditure
Section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that noexpenditure shall be made other than by the candidate or through his or herelection agent. Each candidate is obliged to appoint an election agent.
53The
rationale for this rule lies in establishing and maintaining fairness betweencandidates and providing a mechanism for accountability as to electionexpenses. All accounts relating to election expenses must be reported, within21 days of the election result, to the Returning Officer. Section 76 of the Act
54
permits the Secretary of State to set and raise the permitted amounts ofexpenditure, in line with inflation, by way of statutory instrument. Theallowable amounts are £5,483 per candidate per borough (urban)constituency, plus 4.6 pence for each voter in the constituency and £5,483 plusChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

exceeding the prescribed limits amounts to a corrupt practice under section75(1). Expenditure on national party election broadcasts is met by centralparty funds. Broadcasting is controlled by sections 92 and 93 of the Act, and isconfined to broadcasts made by the British Broadcasting Corporation andIndependent Broadcasting Authority. No broadcast may be made without theconsent of the participating candidate.
55
Several challenges to expenditure have been presented to the courts. In R v
Tronoh Mines Ltd (1952), Tronoh Mines placed an advertisement in The Times
newspaper urging voters not to vote socialist. The company and The Times
were charged under the Act. The court held that the expenditure had beenincurred with a view to promoting the interests of a Party generally, ratherthan an individual candidate; that any advantage incurred was incidental andnot direct; and that accordingly the expenditure did not fall within section 75.Conversely, in DPP v Luft (1977), an anti-fascist group had distributed
pamphlets in three constituencies urging voters not to vote for National Front(extreme right wing) candidates. The group was prosecuted under section 75of the 1983 Act for incurring expenditure with a view to promoting theelection of a candidate without the authority of an election agent. It was heldthat an offence had been committed, even though the promoters were seekingto prevent election of a candidate, rather than directly promote the election ofa preferred candidate. In Walker v Unison (1995) ,the court ruled that section
75(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 had not been breached.During local elections in Scotland, Unison, a trade union, placedadvertisements in national newspapers and on billboards, urging voters not tovote Conservative. The advertisements were placed without the authorisationof an election agent. Two Conservative candidates argued that there had beenan illegal expenditure. The court ruled that the advertisements were ageneralised attack on a political party, and not a direct attack on thecandidates and, accordingly, the advertisements did not contravene the Act.
56
In Grieve v Douglas-Home (1965), Alec Douglas-Home’s election was
alleged to be void on the basis that he had participated in a national PartyPolitical Broadcast on behalf of the Conservative Party and had not declaredthe cost of this expenditure within his election expenses. The court held thatno offence had been committed either by the candidate, the BritishBroadcasting Corporation (BBC) or the Independent Broadcasting Authority(IBA). The court accepted the contention that the intention behind the

56 On a challenge to the former £5 limit on expenditure not authorised by the candidate or
his/her election agent, see Bowman v United Kingdom (1998). The limit operated as a
restriction on freedom of expression and violated the Convention. The limit has been
raised to £500: see Representation of the People Act 1983, s 75(1ZA).

broadcast was not to promote the candidature of Douglas-Home in his own
constituency but to provide general information about the Party to the generalpublic.
Broadcasting and elections 
No broadcast may be made other than through the BBC or the ITC. The role ofthese two organisations is unregulated by statute. There exists a non-statutorybody, the Committee on Party Political Broadcasts, which comprisesrepresentatives from the broadcasting authorities and from the main politicalparties. Broadcasting time is allocated on the basis of the number of votes castfor each party at the last general election, and at by-elections between generalelections. This arrangement disadvantages the Liberal Democrats, who havewide popular support throughout the country, and other smaller parties, suchas the Scottish National Party and the Green Party, which enjoy much popularsupport nationwide which rarely – because of the voting system employed –translates into electoral success.
The ITC is under a statutory duty
57to ensure that news is accurate and
impartial, and that political parties are given a fair allocation of time for partypolitical broadcasts and news coverage of their campaigns. The BBC is notcontrolled by statute, but by Charter, and is under a duty to preserveimpartiality. Judicial review will lie if either body infringes the rules. Thisgeneral duty of fairness was raised by the Rt Hon David Owen MP (now LordOwen), in R v Broadcasting Complaints Commission ex parte Owen (1985) .David
Owen had complained to the Commission that the allocation of time tovarious parties, principally the Social Democratic Party, was unjust or unfairunder section 54 of the Broadcasting Act 1981. On an appeal to the court, itwas held that the Commission had jurisdiction to consider complaints aboutgeneral fairness, rather than just the unfairness, or otherwise, of particularprogrammes, but that the Commission had acted lawfully in allocating timeon the basis of the number of seats won rather than votes cast. A furtherchallenge to the allocation of broadcasting time came in R v British
Broadcasting Corporation ex parte Referendum Party (1997). The Referendum
Party was founded in 1994 and contested 547 seats at the general election. Thebroadcasting authorities allocated the party one five minute broadcast on eachnetwork. The Conservative and Labour Parties each were allocated fourbroadcasts. The Referendum Party sought judicial review, claiming that it hadthree per cent support in public opinion polls and that, given that it was a newparty, the broadcasting authorities should not have relied on past electoralsupport. The Divisional Court held that former electoral support must not bedeterminative, but that the authorities were allowed to include it as a criterion.The decision was not irrational.Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law
43857 Broadcasting Act 1981, s 4.

The Electoral System
In R (Pearson and Another) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and
Others; Hirst v Attorney General (2001), the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court
ruled that domestic law disqualifying prisoners from voting at a
parliamentary or local government election was not incompatible with theright to vote under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 3 ofthe first Protocol to the Convention provides for the holding of free electionsunder conditions ensuring ‘the free expression of the opinion of the people inthe choice of the legislature’. Registration officers had refused to enter theapplicants’ names on the electoral register in light of their imprisonment. Theapplicants sought judicial review of that decision. A further application wasmade (by Mr Hirst) for a declaration under section 4(2) of the Human RightsAct 1998 that section 3(1) of the Representation Act 1983 (which provides thata convicted person detained in a penal institution is legally incapable ofvoting) was incompatible with the Convention. The right to vote was notabsolute, and states had a margin of appreciation as to restrictions. 
The impact on Convention rights was also seen in R (Quintavalle) v British
Broadcasting Corporation (2002), in which the Court of Appeal elevated itself to
the status of ‘the constitutional guardian of the freedom of political debate’and ‘the trustees of democracy’s framework’.
58At issue was the right of a
registered political party, the ProLife Alliance, to insist that the BBC and otherterrestrial broadcasters transmit its party election broadcast whichcontravened, in the BBC’s opinion, the obligation to ensure that nothing in itsprogrammes, inter alia , offended against good taste or decency.
59Laws LJ
asserted that the court’s constitutional responsibility to protect political speechwas overarching. The ProLife film was ‘graphic and disturbing’. Nevertheless,those characteristics could not justify any restriction on freedom of politicalspeech. 
It has been noted above that the law
60requires the consent of participants
in broadcasts. In addition to that requirement, if a candidate participates in abroadcast with a view to promoting his own election, every other candidate inthe constituency must consent to the broadcast. This rule was tested inMarshall v BBC (1979). The candidate, having refused to participate in a
debate, was filmed while canvassing in the streets. On a challenge to thelegality of the broadcast, it was held that no offence had been committed. To‘take part’ in a constituency item, means to take active part in.

Disputed elections
Any challenge to an election campaign must be made within three weeks of
the result being declared. The complaint may be made by a registered elector,by unsuccessful candidates or by their nominees. Since 1868, such challengesgo to the Election Court, a Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench Division ofthe High Court. The court has the power to order a recount; declare corrupt orillegal practices; disqualify a candidate from membership of the House ofCommons and declare the runner-up duly elected; or to order a fresh election.Two cases illustrate this aspect of the law. In Re Parliamentary Election for
Bristol South East (1964), Tony Benn MP, who had recently succeeded to a
peerage as Viscount Stansgate, stood for re-election. The election was declaredvoid and awarded to the runner-up. In Ruffle v Rogers (1982), the election
papers were incorrectly counted and affected the outcome of the election. Theelection was declared void, but the court made clear that had the miscount notaffected the result, the election would have been upheld. A fresh election wasordered in 1997, following allegations concerning the accuracy of the count ofthe vote which returned a Member of Parliament with a majority of just twovotes.
The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998
The Act introduces for the first time a register of political parties. A politicalparty is entitled to be entered on the Register of Political Parties if that partyintends to have one or more candidates at parliamentary elections, elections tothe European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales,the Northern Ireland Assembly or local government elections. Registration isintended to clarify the identity of bona fide political parties and thereby make
regulation more certain. Under section 14, no party political broadcast may bemade by broadcasters other than on behalf of a registered political party.
Political party funding61
In the United Kingdom, there is no provision for state aid for political partiesfor the conduct of election campaigns. Political parties do, however, receivepublic funds for their parliamentary work. Under the system, generallyknown as ‘Short Money’,
62the money allocated is to be spent exclusively in
relation to the party’s parliamentary business, and not for election expenses.The amounts allocated are indicated below. A similar scheme operates in theHouse of Lords. Introduced in 1996 by the then Leader of the House of Lords,Viscount Cranborne, ‘Cranborne Money’ is paid to the first two oppositionChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Commons in 1975 when the system was introduced.

The Electoral System
parties. The Committee on Standards in Public Life has recommended that
both the Commons and the Lords consider considerable increases of theamounts paid to opposition parties. In addition to financial support forparliamentary business, candidates at parliamentary elections or elections tothe European Parliament are entitled to free postage for one electioncommunication to every elector within the constituency. Candidates are alsoentitled to the free use of publicly funded premises for an election meeting.Indirect state assistance is provided through political broadcasts duringelection campaigns. 
For election purposes, parties are dependent upon the support of the
membership and, more importantly, from companies and trades unions.Approximately 30 per cent of Conservative Party funds come fromcompanies, whereas almost 55 per cent of Labour Party funds havetraditionally come from trades union donations, although this pattern hasrecently changed. In 1976, the Houghton Committee recommended that stateaid be given to parties in proportion to the success at the previous election. In1982, the Commission recommended state funding equivalent to individualcontributions to local constituency parties. Neither proposal has beenadopted. Payments are, however, made to opposition parties in parliament onthe basis of a fixed sum for every seat won, plus an amount for every 100votes cast, up to a fixed maximum for any one party.
State funding of political parties?63
Any limitation on the rights of parties to accept funds, disclosed orundisclosed, increases the arguments in favour of state funding of politicalparties. State funding in Europe is an accepted commonplace. Austria,Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain all havepublicly funded political parties. This issue is, however, contentious in theUnited Kingdom on a number of grounds. First, it is argued by theConservative Party that state funding potentially undermines thecohesiveness of the party, and introduces the possibility of politically inspiredchanges to the bases of funding. Moreover, it is argued that state fundingwould encourage the formation and growth of extremist parties. Opposition isalso voiced on the constitutional basis that, to compel citizens to financepolitical parties, through taxation, especially those with which they have nosympathy, would cause dissent. Set against these objections, however, are thebenefits which would accrue from public funding. First, depending on themethod used to calculate entitlement, greater equality and fairness would beachieved among the political parties. Secondly, party political finances wouldbecome most clearly a matter of open public record. Thirdly, the elimination
44163 See Report of the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties , Cmd 6601, 1976, London:
HMSO (the ‘Houghton Report’); Hansard Society Commission, The Financing of Political
Parties, 1981; the Home Affairs Select Committee, Funding of Political Parties , HC 301
(1993–94), London: HMSO.

of contributions from individuals and organisations would eradicate the
public’s suspicions about the integrity of party political finance and thusenhance confidence in the political process. Fourthly, the ability of parties toconduct their official duties would be enhanced by improving the level ofcontributions made. The Houghton Committee commented, in its 1976 report,that, at a local level, party organisation was weak and ‘generally exists on apitifully inadequate scale of accommodation, equipment, trained staff andresources’. Thus, improved funding would facilitate an enhanced level ofefficiency at the grass roots level of democracy. 
In November 1997, the Labour Government extended the terms of
reference of the Committee on Standards in Public Life to include politicalparty funding. Recognising that ‘political parties are essential to democracy’,the Committee identified three of the seven ‘principles of public life’, namely,integrity, accountability and openness, as particularly relevant to the fundingof political parties. Increasing election spending by the two main parties, whobetween them spent some £54 million on the 1997 general election, and theissue of large donations to political parties by persons known or unknown,gave rise to the public perception that election results can be affected byspending and that wealthy organisations or individuals could effectivelyinfluence public policy. Undisclosed foreign donations to the ConservativeParty also caused concern. Whereas the Conservative Party accepted 47overseas donations worth a total of £16.2 million between 1992 and 1997, theLabour Party received none. In the same period, the Conservative Partyreceived over 1,300 donations of over £5,000 while the Labour Party receivedalmost 300.
In the Committee’s view, it was ‘undesirable that a political party should
be dependent for its financial survival on funds provided by a few wellendowed individuals, corporations or organisations’, irrespective of ‘whetheror not the suspicion [that he who pays the piper calls the tune] is justified’.The problem of public confidence in the political system was compoundedwhen such donations came from undisclosed sources. 
On the issue of state funding for political parties, the Committee
considered the arguments for and against increasing aid. The principalargument in favour was that public funding would ‘purify’ the politicalprocess by eliminating the need for parties to be reliant on donations. State aidwould also enable the parties to fulfil their functions more effectively, bothensuring that sufficient funds were available to cover costs and that partieswere not reliant on individuals or organisations for finance. On the otherhand, it was argued, inter alia ,that individual taxpayers should not be obliged
to contribute to financing political parties with whose views they disagreed.There was also the problem of the criteria for state aid, which, if dependentupon success at elections, could deter new parties from access to funding. TheCommittee found the arguments for and against state funding ‘finelybalanced’, but the arguments in favour were not conclusive. The CommitteeChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Electoral System
considered that its proposals for limits on campaign expenditure coupled with
the requirements of disclosure and registration would meet the concernsexpressed about the current system of party funding.
DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES: THE 2000 ACT
Part IV of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 providesfor the control of donations to registered parties and their members, definingpermissible donors and providing rules regulating the acceptance or return ofdonations, and providing for forfeiture of donations by impermissible orunidentifiable donors, under a court order, on an application of theCommission. A person commits an offence if he or she knowingly enters into,or does any act in furtherance of, any arrangement which facilitates or is likelyto facilitate the making of donations by any person or donor other than apermissible donor. The Act provides for quarterly donation reports to bemade, and, in the period of general elections, for weekly reports.
64Under
section 69, the Commission is to maintain a register of donations.
Part V of the Act relates to campaign expenditure. No expenditure may be
incurred by or on behalf of the registered party unless it is incurred with theauthority of the treasurer or deputy treasurer of the party, or a personauthorised by the treasurer or deputy treasurer. No campaign expendituremay be incurred unless it is made by the above.
65Section 74 and Schedule 8
impose limits on campaign expenditure in relation to parliamentary generalelections and general elections to the European Parliament, ScottishParliament, National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly.In relation to a parliamentary general elections, the limit applying tocampaign expenditure in England, Scotland and Wales is £30,000 multipliedby the number of constituencies contested by the party in that part of theUnited Kingdom, of, if greater, in relation to England, £810,000, Scotland,£120,000 and Wales, £60,000. In relation to Northern Ireland, the limit is£30,000 multiplied by the number of constituencies contested by the partythere. In relation to general elections to the European Parliament, the limit is£45,000 multiplied by the number of MEPs to be returned for that part of theUnited Kingdom at the election. In relation to general elections to the ScottishParliament, the limits on campaign expenditure incurred by or on behalf of aregistered party in the relevant period are £12,000 for each constituencycontested by the party, plus £80,000 for each region contested by the party. Inrelation to elections to the Welsh Assembly, the limits are £10,000 for eachconstituency and £40,000 for each region contested by the party. In relation toNorthern Ireland, the limit is £17,000 for each constituency. Special provisionis made where there is a combination of elections to the European Parliamentand a devolved legislature.

Part VII and Schedule 13 regulate expenditure at referendums. The
amount persons or bodies designated by the Commission under section 103
and registered parties within section 100(1)(a) but not designated undersection 103 may expend is related to the percentage of votes cast for a party’scandidates at the last parliamentary general election, and ranges between£500,000 and £5 million.
Schedule 18 of the Act makes new provision for the control of political
donations by companies and amends the Companies Act 1985, inserting anew Part XA. Inter alia , a company is prohibited from making any donation to
any registered party to any other EU political organisation, or incurring anyEU political expenditure unless the donation or expenditure is authorised byvirtue of an approval resolution passed by the company in general meetingbefore the relevant time. An approval resolution is a resolution passed byspecial resolution procedure or a resolution passed by any percentage of themembers greater than that required for an ordinary resolution.

VOTING SYSTEMS67
The first and foremost object of reforming zeal ought, in my opinion, to be the
system of parliamentary representation, or rather misrepresentation.68
The Labour Government came to power in 1997 committed to major electoral
reform, and to holding a referendum to ascertain the people’s view.Substantial reform has taken place. The 1999 elections to the new ScottishParliament employed the additional member system, as did election to thenew National Assembly for Wales. The 1999 elections to the new NorthernIreland Assembly employed the single transferable vote system, one alreadyutilised for elections in Northern Ireland to the European Parliament and forlocal elections. The 1999 elections for the European Parliament in the rest ofthe United Kingdom saw the introduction of a new system of proportionalrepresentation based on party lists. Despite these reforms, no move has yetbeen made to reform the simple majority system employed for elections to theUnited Kingdom Parliament. In this section, the merits and demerits ofdiffering systems are considered.Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law
44466 The chairman of the new Electoral Commission is Sam Younger: the Commission
started work on 19 January 2001. The rules relating to disclosure of large donations
came into force in February 2001 and will be kept under review by the Commission.The Commission is to consider whether any upper limit should be imposed ondonations after the next general election. As from 2002, the maximum allowableexpenditure is £20 million.
67 See Finer, 1975; Bogdanor, 1981 and 1983; Bogdanor and Butler, 1983; Chandler, 1982;
Oliver, 1983; Butler, ‘Electoral reform’, in Jowell and Oliver, 1999.
68 Wade, 1989.

The Electoral System
Vernon Bogdanor categorises voting systems under three heads: plurality
systems; majority systems; and proportional systems. Under the heading of
proportional systems, there exists a range of differing systems: 
Proportional representation’ is in fact a generic term denoting a number of
different systems sharing only the common aim of proportionality betweenseats and votes. This common aim, however, does not prevent the variousproportional systems diverging considerably, one from another; and theirpolitical consequences, therefore, can be quite different. [Bogdanor and Butler,1983, p 2]
Despite recent reforms, the United Kingdom is out of step with much of the
rest of the world in terms of systems employed for electing its nationalparliament. As a generalisation, it can be said that those countries influencedby English common law are the countries which retain the majority system ofvoting. The majority of states on the continent of Europe employ a list system;France by contrast employs a system which involves two ballots. In France,when no candidate wins an absolute majority of the vote in the first ballot, asecond ballot is held to determine which of those candidates who have gained12.5 per cent of the registered electorate in the first ballot are to be elected. InAustralia, two electoral systems are employed. For election to the House ofRepresentatives, a system of compulsory preferential voting is used. Forelection to the Senate, a proportional representation system is employed. 
The simple majority system
If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as
possible the preferences of the voters, this system is probably the worst thatcould be devised.
69
For elections to the United Kingdom Parliament, the system of election
remains the simple majority (colloquially, ‘first past the post’) system. Theorigins of the voting system lie in tradition, and it should be noted that thevoting system is not a matter of law, but of past political practice. Oneprincipal merit of the system lies in its simplicity. The candidate who gains thelargest number of votes in the election wins the seat – irrespective of theproportion of votes cast for himself or his opponents. Thus, to illustrate, if thevotes cast for individual candidates at an election are: 
44569 Wade, 1989, p 9.CANDIDATE NUMBER OF VOTES
Smith 3,200
Jones 2,700
Brown 2,500
TOTAL 7,400

Smith wins the election, even though 5,200, or 70 per cent, voters have voted
for the other candidates. This lack of representativeness – when viewed fromthe perspective of proportionality of votes cast to seats won – is reflected inthe results nationwide.
The 1997 and 2001 general elections
The general election of 1 May 1997 resulted in a landslide victory for theLabour Party.
70Tony Blair MP became the youngest Prime Minister, at the
age of 43, since 1812, and only the fifth Labour Prime Minister in thiscentury.
71The electoral turnout was 71.3 per cent in 1997, but only 59 per cent
in 2001. The 2001 election results were as follows:
Party Number of seats Percentage of vote Percentage of seats
Labour 413 42.0% 62.7%
Conservative 166 32.7% 25.2%
Liberal Democrat 52 18.8% 7.9%
Other 28 6.5% 4.2%
TOTAL 659 100.0% 100.0%
The Electoral Reform Society calculated that had there been a system of
proportional representation in place for the 1997 election, the results wouldhave been much different, namely:
Party Number of seats Percentage of vote Percentage of seats
Labour 286 44.4% 43.4%
Conservative 199 31.4% 30.2%
Liberal Democrat 109 17.2% 16.5%
Other 65 7.0% 9.9% 
TOTAL 659 100.0% 100.0%
Far from having a commanding majority in the House of Commons, the
Labour government would have had 286 seats, the opposition parties 308.Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Electoral System
It is figures such as these which explain the demands for reform of the
electoral system. Several alternatives present themselves, some of which offer
proportional representation, others of which do not, but do represent animprovement of the representativeness of parliament when compared withthe simple majority system. The alternative vote, the supplementary vote, theadditional member system and the single transferable vote are all alternativesystems. The alternative vote and supplementary vote are both majoritariansystems. The latter two – the additional member system and the singletransferable vote, along with the party list system – are proportionalrepresentation systems. Simply stated, proportional representation means thatMembers should be elected to parliament on a party basis which reflects theproportion of votes cast for a party in the election: thus, if 40 per cent of thepopulation vote Liberal Democrat, then 40 per cent of the parliamentary seatsshould be held by that party; not as under the present system, where the 1987election revealed that 15 per cent of the population voted Liberal Democratbut, in terms of seats in parliament, the party only won three per cent of seats. 
Alternative voting systems
The alternative vote
This system retains individual constituencies, but introduces the notion ofmultiple votes in order of preference. As noted above, it is a majoritariansystem, not a proportional representation system. The voter marks his ballotpaper with preferences expressed in numerical order. The candidate whowins 50 per cent of the first preference vote is declared elected. Should nocandidate achieve 50 per cent, the votes of the candidate who achieves thelowest number of first preference votes are redistributed in accordance withthat candidate’s supporters’ second preferences. The process is continueduntil one candidate achieves an overall majority of votes compared with allother candidates. Where the system fails is from the point of view ofproportional representation, since the overall result will bear little or noresemblance to proportionality. It would also potentially have the effect ofreturning to parliament candidates who have achieved no clear support (ormandate) from the people. The system does, however, ensure that, withineach constituency, the candidate with most support overall is returned toparliament.
The advantages of the alternative vote are, first, that the traditional one
member, one constituency principle is retained and, secondly, that the electedcandidate has a majority of votes, as compared with other candidates.
The supplementary vote
This system is very similar to the alternative vote system, and is the systemrecommended by the working party on electoral systems set up by the Labour
44772Report of the Working Party on Electoral Systems , 1993, London: Labour Party.

Party, under the chairmanship of Lord Plant, which reported in 1993.72The
system allows voters to express a preference through voting for two
candidates. If no candidate secures 50 per cent of the vote, the secondpreferences cast for all candidates other than the top two are redistributedbetween the two leading candidates until a clear winner emerges. Where thereare only three candidates, this system would work smoothly. However, thesystem becomes more complex in constituencies where a greater number ofcandidates is standing for election, for the electorate would not be clear as towho the leading two candidates will be, and may therefore vote tactically inorder to ensure, as far as possible, that a candidate who they did not wantelected, would not be in either of the two top positions. 
The additional member system (AMS)73
This is the system adopted for the 1999 elections to the Scottish Parliamentand Welsh Assembly. The additional member system seeks to combine theadvantages of the single member constituency, with overall proportionalitybetween votes and seats. The system has been used in West Germany since1945. Under AMS, three quarters of the United Kingdom’s Members ofParliament (487 seats) would be elected in single member constituencies,using the first past the post system. The remaining one quarter (163 seats)would be ‘additional members’, elected from party lists on a regional partybasis, employing a formula based on the largest average of votes cast betweenthe parties. The additional Members thus top up the total for each party inorder to give overall proportionality. 
Under AMS, each voter would thus have two votes: one for the candidate
of his choice in the constituency, one for the party of his choice on a regionalbasis. The additional member system has the advantage of remaining close tothe system which is currently in place, while departing from it sufficiently toensure proportionality. The system would necessitate a reduction of thenumber of constituency Members of Parliament in order to accommodate theregionally elected Members. If the division between constituency and regionalMembers is to be equal, this would necessitate doubling the size of currentconstituencies. However, the additional member system also confers widepowers on political parties who would control who is to be included on theregional list, and in what order of priority. For this reason, the HansardSociety Commission on Electoral Reform, chaired by Lord Blake, concludedthat the German model of AMS was not suitable for Britain.
74
There is a variant of this system which is employed in local elections in
Germany which avoids the problem of party control. Under this variant ofAMS, all candidates stand directly as constituency candidates, but only threequarters, or some other percentage, are elected in single memberChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Society, para 93.

The Electoral System
constituencies. The remaining one quarter of seats would be allocated to those
who had been runners up in the election contest, who would sit as additionalmembers.
Single transferable vote (STV)75
Employed in Northern Ireland for the European Parliament elections andelections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, the single transferable voteoffers both proportionality between votes and seats and a constituency based,but multi-member, system of election. The STV was recommended forintroduction in urban constituencies as long ago as 1917. The STV wouldinvolve a rearrangement of the current single member constituencies into farlarger regional units, each returning several Members of Parliament. Themethod of calculation varies, but is based on a quota of the votes cast that isachieved either by first preference voting producing the required quota or theredistribution of votes cast for losing candidates. The STV offers bothproportionality and the greatest range of choice to electors. The system usedfor local elections and elections to the European Parliament in NorthernIreland
76requires that the total number of votes be divided by one more than
the number of vacant seats, plus one. The current constituencies wouldrequire alteration in order to increase their size to accommodate threeMembers (or four or five, as favoured by the Liberal Democrats),
77which
would require a fresh look at the criteria for constituency boundaries. Thecurrent requirement to respect local authority boundaries is the most obviouscriteria which would be compromised if such a system were to be adopted.
This is the most complex of alternative systems and, for that reason alone,
is not favoured by many, although, despite the complexity, the system workswell in Northern Ireland. The voter expresses his or her preferences forcandidates in numerical order. A quota is predetermined. Thus, in a fivemember constituency, the quota would be approximate to one sixth of thevotes cast. Successful candidates are those reaching the quota, and those whoon a redistribution of second, third and more remote preferences reach thequota. If less than the required number of candidates reach the quota figure,then redistribution of second preferences will take place until the requirednumber of elected Members is reached. If, on the other hand, the requirednumber of elected Members is not achieved by the redistribution of secondpreferences, then a third stage comes into play. The candidate who polled thelowest number of votes is then eliminated, and the votes for that candidatedistributed among the other remaining candidates in order of preferencesexpressed. This process of elimination continues until the quota is reached forall five required elected Members.

The party list system78
This system requires that a list of candidates be nominated by each political
party. The votes for each party’s list are calculated on a nationwide basis –rather than a constituency basis – and the parties obtain the number of seats inthe legislature in direct proportion to the votes in the country. The party listsystem is not a serious contender for adoption in the United Kingdom. Twoprincipal defects are perceived with the system: first, that it destroys electionon the basis of constituencies, and secondly, that too much patronage is placedin the hands of party leaders. Within the two principal political parties in theUnited Kingdom – Conservative and Labour – there exists a broad spectrumof political opinion: from the political left to the political right in each party.To leave the power of nomination, and the positioning of candidates on the‘list’, to political leaders would potentially exclude some of the best candidates– most likely, those whose views are incompatible with, or troublesome to, theleadership.
THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST 
REFORMING THE SIMPLE MAJORITY SYSTEM
Most of the arguments for reform of the electoral system centre on the allegeddefects of the present system. Reformers argue that the status quo results in agovernment which does not represent the majority of the voters’ wishes. Sincethe Second World War, no government has been elected with a majority ofvotes overall. The Liberal Democrats have been arguing for reform for manyyears, and they are not alone in this. Lord Hailsham, former ConservativeLord Chancellor and Cabinet minister, and Angus Maude have bothquestioned the democratic basis of the current system. Professor SE Finer,Vernon Bogdanor and Professor HWR Wade
79have all questioned the status
quo. 
The case for reform therefore centres on the principle of democracy and
equality in voting power. For democracy to have real meaning, it is arguedthat the government of the day, and the composition of the legislature as awhole, must reflect the wishes of the electors. Under such a system, it can beargued that the government would have enhanced authority to pursue itselectoral mandate. In answer to the charge that proportional representationcan result in weak government, reformers argue that less extreme, rather thanweak, government would be the result. Such an outcome would force a‘rethink’ in radical politics, with governments being keenly aware that with aslim majority in parliament, and possibly the balance of power being held by athird party (both outcomes which are common to proportional representationChapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Electoral System
systems), certain radical policies would have to be modified. Thus many of the
more politically contentious subjects, such as education and health, might belargely removed from party political conflict: consensus would become theonly way in which to make legislative progress.
Reformers also point to the inequity of the distribution of the vote between
the parties under the current system. The simple majority system invariablefavours a two party system, and leaves little room for the adequaterepresentation of smaller parties. The Liberal Democrat Party regularlyachieves approximately 25 per cent of the popular vote at general elections(and has a high success rate at by-elections), but that overall popularity doesnot translate itself into a proportionally related number of parliamentaryseats. One explanation for this result is that votes for the Liberal Democratsare spread fairly evenly over the United Kingdom, and not concentrated inone geographic area (although the south west of England is becoming aLiberal stronghold). It is otherwise with the Conservative and Labour Parties.For the most part, the United Kingdom is subject to an electoral north-southdivide, with the Labour Party holding a majority of seats in the north, theConservatives dominating the southern seats (and being unrepresented inScotland). 
The case for the status quo is linked to the point made above. The simple
majority system generally, although not invariably, produces a governmentwith a strong parliamentary majority which is able to implement its electoralprogramme without undue hindrance. This argument requires carefulevaluation. One of the often experienced effects of proportional representationbased systems is that governments are returned with either a very smallmajority of seats or with a minority of seats overall in the legislature. One ofthe most significant effects of this result is that minority parties with few seatsand relatively small electoral support may hold a disproportionate amount ofpower, making governments dependent upon their wishes in order toimplement their legislative programme. As a result of such dependence,governments are also subject to the risk of defeats on motions of noconfidence,
80thus producing general political insecurity and the potential for
frequent elections. 
A further, related effect is that a government may be required to
compromise substantially upon its electoral promises in order to govern.Under the current system, it is generally the case that the elected government– always depending upon its majority in parliament – is relatively free toimplement its electoral programme. In other words, the voter knows what heis getting in terms of policies and proposals for legislation. Underproportional representation, where less strong government is the frequentresult, voters can be far less certain either that the policies for which they arevoting will be implemented or of the policies which will be pursued after the
45180 See Chapters 6 and 11.

election. In countries where politics are less polarised than has traditionally
been the case in the United Kingdom, this consequence may be of littlepractical significance: in the United Kingdom, the political spectrum is stillsufficiently diverse and conflicting as to cause disquiet and to compromisegovernment.
There also exist doubts as to the effects of a reformed system on the
convention of collective ministerial responsibility; see Chapter 11. Undercurrent constitutional arrangements, the convention of collectiveresponsibility requires that the Cabinet ‘speaks with one voice’ in order tomaintain parliamentary, and electoral, confidence. The rule accordinglyrequires that, where a decision has been made by the Cabinet, each member ofCabinet and non-Cabinet ministers and all their Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries, adhere to the decision and do not speak out against it. Such ashow of unity would prove difficult to sustain in governments which wereeither coalition or minority governments. The sister doctrine of individualministerial responsibility might also prove more difficult to adhere to,particularly where a minister felt unable to support and pursue a policy withwhich he or she disagreed on political principle. One consequence, therefore,which could flow from the introduction of some form of proportionalrepresentation could be that governments become less cohesive and, as aresult, less commanding of the confidence of the people.
A further argument is put for the status quo: that of the close links
currently established between the constituency Member and his or herelectorate. Irrespective of the proportion of votes won in an election, theMember of Parliament, once duly elected, and irrespective of political party,represents each and every one of his or her constituents in parliament.Constituencies are relatively small and Members of Parliament are accessible –through surgeries and other contact – to the voters. A Member is thus able togain a detailed knowledge of his or her constituency, its geography, industryand economy, environment and populace. With large constituencies, such adetailed working knowledge of an area becomes more difficult, with theattendant possibility that a Member is less effective in his representation ofthat constituency in parliament.
As can be seen, the issue of electoral reform is by no means clear-cut, and
real potential constitutional problems could be encountered as a result of itsintroduction. At the end of the day, the quest for an alternative system isrooted in the paramountcy of the principle of real democracy and equality ofrepresentation of the people in parliament. Against that ideal must be set theconstitutional implications of introducing reform.
As noted above, one of the manifesto pledges of the Labour Party before
the 1997 election was a review of the electoral system for the WestminsterParliament and, once in office, the government appointed Liberal peer LordJenkins to review the system. The Jenkins Commission reported in October1998, and recommended a novel, if complex, solution. The Commission,Chapter 13: Constitutional and Administrative Law
452

The Electoral System
wanting to retain single member constituencies but also inject a greater degree
of proportionality into the system, opted for a ‘mixed system’ made up of thealternative vote and regional list systems. Constituency members would beelected on the alternative vote system, and comprise 80–85 per cent ofmembers, with additional members, 15–20 per cent elected on the regional listbasis. Greater proportionality would be achieved, while the traditional stronglink between a member and his or her constituency would be retained. Thesystem would also, the Commission claimed, avoid coalition governmentsand in its estimation would have produced a single party majoritygovernment in three out of the four last general elections.
81
The current position is that the United Kingdom now employs a number
of differing systems: a new system of proportional representation was used inMay 1999 for elections to the European Parliament, for elections to the ScottishParliament and National Assembly for Wales the additional member systemwas used, and for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the singletransferable vote system. The issue which remains unresolved is the votingsystem for elections to the United Kingdom Parliament. The government hadpromised to hold a referendum on that matter and as seen above, the JenkinsCommission recommended a mixed system of voting. The government hashowever deferred both issues. Despite the experimentation with reform, thegovernment appears unconvinced of wholesale reform of the systememployed for elections to the Westminster Parliament.

CHAPTER 14
Parliament is composed of the Crown, the House of Lords and the House of
Commons. Its origins lie in the King’s Council – the assembly of adviserssummoned by the King – and the term ‘parliament’ can be traced to thethirteenth century.
1
In order to evaluate parliament, it is necessary to examine its composition
and procedure. The former task may be accomplished by looking at the actualmembership of parliament by party allegiance at a fixed point in time or bylooking at it in a more sociological manner in order to analyse the class andeducational background of Members and their employment status. Theundertaking is complicated by the bicameral nature of parliament and the factthat the House of Commons is elected and the House of Lords unelected. Theimportance of procedure, particularly in the House of Commons, cannot beoveremphasised. Only by acquiring an understanding of the procedural rulescan sense be made of the functions of parliament and its importance, orotherwise, in the process of government. In the absence of a writtenconstitution which clearly defines and allocates powers and functions, themanner in which the legislative proposals of government are examined, andthe administration of the state scrutinised, assumes central importance to thenotion of democratic control of the executive. The doctrine ofconstitutionalism can only be effective if the procedures adopted byparliament are effective in controlling the government. 
THE FUNCTIONS OF PARLIAMENT
In Representative Government (1861), John Stuart Mill wrote of parliament:
Instead of the function of governing, for which it is radically unfit, the proper
office of a representative assembly is to watch and control the government; tothrow the light of publicity on its acts; to compel a full exposition andjustification of all of them which anyone considers questionable; to censurethem if found condemnable; and if the men who compose the governmentabuse their trust, or fulfil it in a manner which conflicts with the deliberatesense of the nation, to expel them from office, and either expressly or virtuallyappoint their successors.
The House of Commons is the sounding board of the nation – an arena in
which not only the general opinion of the nation, but that of every section of itcan produce itself in full light and challenge discussion. 
455INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
1 The role of the sovereign is discussed in Chapter 6. The House of Lords is discussed in
Chapter 17.

Very little has changed. Parliament is not there to govern: that is for the
executive. Parliament exists to represent the views and opinions of the peopleand to influence, constrain and demand justification for the actions ofgovernment and to give them legitimacy.
Accordingly, the functions of parliament may be summarised as being:
2
(a) to provide the personnel of government;
(b) to legitimise government actions; and
(c) to subject matters of public policy to scrutiny and influence.
As discussed in Chapters 7 and 12, the devolution of legislative power to the
Northern Ireland Assembly and Scottish Parliament and, to a lesser extent, theWelsh Assembly affects the scope of the United Kingdom Parliament’s roleand functions. In terms of debating and scrutinising government policy andadministration and the passage of legislation, while the United KingdomParliament (Westminster) remains the sovereign legislature in the UnitedKingdom, there is now a diffusion of power – differing in nature and scope –between Westminster and the devolved institutions.
THE LIFE OF A PARLIAMENT
A parliament is summoned to meet by the sovereign following a generalelection, and the life of the parliament will run until the subsequent generalelection. Under section 7 of the Parliament Act 1911, the life of a parliament isrestricted to five years from the day on which first appointed to meet, unlesspreviously dissolved. Parliaments are summoned and dissolved byProclamation of the Crown on the advice of the Privy Council; see Chapter 6.The average life of a parliament is three years, one month. The parliamentelected in June 1983 lasted for three years 11 months; that of June 1987 for fouryears ten months. By contrast, the previous parliament elected in 1992 existedfor just under the maximum five year term. The 1997 parliament existed forfour years and one month.
The parliamentary session
A parliamentary session is the parliamentary year, which commences inNovember. There is no legal requirement as to the length of a session. At theend of the session, parliament is formally closed by the Queen and stands‘prorogued’ until the new session begins. The significance of prorogation liesin the fact that all business is suspended until the new session. 
The number of sitting days per session varies from year to year. In 1991–92
(a short session terminated by the dissolution of parliament), 83. The figure forthe 1992–93 session was 240 days. The average session length is 168 days. InChapter 14: Constitutional and Administrative Law
4562 Norton, 1985a and see 1993.

Introduction to the House of Commons
the 1998–99 session, there were 149 sitting days, the daily average sitting being
nine hours and 15 minutes, and in 2000–2001, 83 sitting days, averaging eighthours and 19 minutes.
Parliamentary sittings
The term ‘parliamentary sitting’ relates to the daily business of the House.Under Standing Orders, the rules of the House, parliament meets at 2.30 pmfrom Monday to Thursday, and from 9.30 am on Fridays. The House isadjourned for three weeks at Christmas, one week at Easter, for the whole ofAugust and for most of September. In emergency situations, the House maybe recalled for urgent debate during a recess or at a weekend, as occurred in1982 for debate on the invasion of the Falkland Islands.
3The daily
proceedings of the House generally cease at 10.00 pm but frequently willextend beyond this time. The average duration of a sitting is eight and threequarter hours, Monday to Thursday, and on Fridays, five and a half hours.
The length of parliamentary sittings varies according to the pressure of
time on the House. In the 1980s, for example, seven sittings lasted over 24hours, the longest recorded in that decade, being 32 hours and 12 minutes.
4
Where the House sits beyond the normal time of the commencement ofbusiness the following day, the business of that day (with the exception ofQuestions put down for written answer for that day) will be lost. It is a matterof constant concern that parliament sits unsocial hours and, for this reason,reforms have been introduced, in 1995, to limit the number of occasions onwhich parliament sits after 10.00 pm. Under Standing Orders, the normalbusiness of parliament should end at 10.00 pm. However, certain business isexempted from that rule, which results in lengthy sittings. The Houseresolved not to sit on eight Fridays, in order to facilitate the constituency workof Members of Parliament which is traditionally undertaken on Fridays and atweekends. Further, the House resolved to meet on Wednesdays at 10.00 amand to hold debates until 2.30 pm, when the normal business of the Housewill commence. 
SUMMONING, ADJOURNMENT, PROROGATION,5
AND DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT
Summoning
It is within the Crown’s prerogative to determine when parliament should besummoned. However, under statute, the Queen is bound to issue writs within

three years of the ending of a parliament.6In practice, a parliament must be
summoned to meet every year in order that approval can be given for monies
to be provided for public services. Parliament is summoned to meet byproclamation of the Queen. The proclamation dissolves the previousparliament, orders the issue of writs by the Lord Chancellor and appoints theday and place for the meeting of the new parliament.
Adjournment
During a parliamentary session, parliament will be adjourned on manyoccasions. The adjournment is no more than an ‘interruption in the course ofone and the same session’.
7Up to a quarter of the time in the House of
Commons is spent debating the question: ‘... that this House do nowadjourn.’
8The effect of adjournment is to suspend the sitting of the House for
a period, but to leave unaffected the business of the House. Adjournmentstake place for a number of reasons and to effect a number of consequences. 
A motion for adjournment can be used in debate to interrupt proceedings.
The motion will take the form ‘that the debate be now adjourned’. The devicemay be used as an alternative to moving an amendment to the question beforethe House, and will be used to determine consideration of the matter underconsideration. The Speaker has a discretion whether to decline to put thematter to the House. The business which has been interrupted can be broughtbefore the House at the next sitting day, provided that notice is given.
Daily adjournment debates
There is a daily motion for adjournment which suspends the day’s sitting.Once the motion for adjournment has been moved, the daily adjournmentdebate takes place.
9The adjournment debate enables one Member to speak on
a topic, previously notified, for 15 minutes, and to receive a ministerial reply.Topics may include any matter other than a request for legislation. There is aweekly ballot held at which successful Members are chosen for theadjournment debate, other than for the debate on Thursdays when the choiceof Member is made by the Speaker.
Adjournment debates before holidays
Adjournment debates also take place before the House adjourns forholidays.
10No ballot is held for participation: five backbenchers speak for half
an hour each and the Leader of the House replies to the debate.Chapter 14: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Introduction to the House of Commons
Adjournment debates following consideration of Consolidated Fund Bills
In any session, there will be three Consolidated Fund Bills before parliament.
Second reading consideration is purely formal, with no debate. Whenproceedings are finished, any Member of the government may move a motion‘that this House do now adjourn’. The ensuing debate may last until 9.00 amthe following day, 8.00 am on Fridays. Private Members can raise any matter,but their names are balloted. One and a half or three hours may be allocated toany topic, at the discretion of the speaker. 
Adjournments for emergency debates
Provision is made under Standing Orders for urgent matters to be brought tothe attention of the House for early debate. A Member may, at the start ofbusiness of the day, propose that the House be adjourned for consideration ofan urgent matter. It is within the discretion of the Speaker as to whether thematter should be discussed. If satisfied, it is then for the House to give leavefor the debate. If refused, the support of not more than 40 Members of theHouse is required in order for leave to be granted.
11The debate will take
place at the start of business the following day.
Prorogation
Prorogation is effected under the prerogative, by the announcement of theQueen’s command. The effect of prorogation is that all business beforeparliament is suspended. Any Bill which has not concluded its parliamentarystages must be brought anew to the future parliament. Parliament will beprorogued until a specified date. The prorogation of parliament has not beeneffected in person by the Crown since 1854: the normal procedure is forparliament to be prorogued by a commission under the Great Seal. The periodbetween prorogation and the summoning of a new parliament is known asthe ‘recess’. 
Dissolution12
For detailed discussion of dissolution, see Chapter 6. Parliament is dissolvedprior to a general election. Under the Parliament Act 1911, the maximumduration of the life of a parliament is five years. Dissolution is thereforerequired before the expiry of this period. For the most part, the Prime Ministerwill seek a dissolution – effected by the Crown under the royal prerogative –at a date which is politically favourable to his or her party. It is entirely withinthe Prime Minister’s personal discretion when to seek a dissolution.Alternatively, dissolution may be sought when the government loses the

support of the House of Commons. Governments may suffer defeats in the
Commons on a range of issues which will not force a dissolution. However, ifthe government is defeated on a motion of confidence on a matter central toits administration a dissolution will be forced.
When a dissolution is granted, the government does not resign until after a
defeat in the general election. It was seen in Chapter 6 that, in 1974, the PrimeMinister, Edward Heath, did not resign until it was clear that he could notform a pact with the Liberal Party which would secure a working majority inthe Commons.
THE ORGANISATION OF BUSINESS
The business in a typical parliamentary session is as follows. The sessionopens with the State Opening of parliament and the Queen’s Speech, whichoutlines the government’s proposals for legislation in the session. Thefollowing five days are spent in Debate on the Address, including two days onwhich the Opposition proposes – ‘moves’ – amendments to specific areas ofpolicy. The government then introduces the most important Bills and, untilChristmas, most of the time of the House will be spent on second readingdebates on these Bills. Between Christmas and Easter, the majority of the timeof the House will be spent in second reading debates and the committee stageof Bills. Before the end of July, the remaining legislative stages of Bills takeplace.

Introduction to the House of Commons
PERSONNEL OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
The office of Speaker
The office of Speaker is traceable to 1377 and the appointment of Sir Thomas
Hungerford although, from 1258, parliaments had similar officers.13The
Speaker of the House featured in the constitutional struggles between Kingand parliament in the seventeenth century. When Charles I arrived in theCommons to arrest the Five Knights, the Speaker declared:
May it please Your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in
this place, but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here,and I humbly beg Your Majesty’s pardon that I cannot give any other answerthan this to what Your Majesty is pleased to demand of me.
Henceforth, the independence of the Speaker from the Crown was
established.
The Speaker regulates the proceedings of the House. The Speaker is a
senior Member appointed by common agreement of all Members and isgenerally a Member of the Opposition Party. The election of the Speaker is thefirst task undertaken by parliament following a general election. The Speakeracts with political impartiality and controls the business of the House. 
The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House and ensures that the rules
of conduct and order are observed. The Speaker is also the representative ofthe Commons in relations with the Crown – it is through the Speaker that theprivilege of access to the Sovereign is effected – and the House of Lords andother bodies outside parliament. When the House of Lords amendsCommons’ Bills, the Speaker checks the amendments to ensure that they donot infringe the financial privileges of the lower House. It is also the functionof the Speaker to certify Bills under the Parliament Act 1911. 
The Speaker has a discretion in relation to the granting of an application
for an emergency debate, whether to allow private notice questions or grantrequests for emergency debates, and whether a prima facie case of a breach of
the privileges of the House has been established. It is also for the Speaker torule on matters of procedure. Furthermore, the Speaker will decide whether aproposed amendment to a motion will be accepted.
Disciplinary powers of the Speaker
The control of debate lies in the Speaker, who chooses who is allowed tospeak. Advance notice of the wish to participate in debate is given and theSpeaker calls each side (government and Opposition) alternately, and respectsthe rights of minority parties to participate. The Speaker has powers underStanding Orders to control the following:

(b) minor breaches of order;
(c) the use of disorderly or unparliamentary expressions;(d) grossly disorderly conduct;(e) grave disorder;
(f) obstruction of the business of the House by other means.
Disorderly conduct – such as damaging the Mace
14– may result in the
Member, if a suitable apology is not given to the House, being suspended
from the House for a period determined by the House on a motion.15
Suspension from the House in the first instance will be for five sitting days, ona second occasion for 20 days and in the event of a further repetition, for theremainder of the session. Any Member refusing to withdraw from thechamber of the House may be forcibly removed by the Serjeant at Arms.
16In
such an event, the Member will be suspended for the remainder of theparliamentary session.
If a Member persists in a speech after being ordered to discontinue on the
basis of irrelevance or tedious repetition, the Speaker may direct him towithdraw from the House for the remainder of the sitting, or ‘name’ him fordisregarding the authority of the Speaker’s Chair. The same penalty maybefall a Member who uses unparliamentary language. Unparliamentarylanguage includes:
(a) the imputation of false or unavowed motives;(b) the misrepresentation of the language of another and the accusation of
misrepresentation;
(c) charges of uttering a deliberate falsehood;
(d) abusive and insulting language likely to create disorder.

The Leader of the House is responsible to the Prime Minister for the
organisation of business in the Commons. It is the function of the Leader ofthe House to announce the parliamentary business for the following week.The Leader of the House is a minister of the Crown.

Introduction to the House of Commons
The party whips
The party political control of Members of Parliament is in the hands of the
party whips. On the government side, all whips receive salaries18and are
ministers of the Crown. The Chief Whip19is assisted by up to 12 other
Members. The Chief Whip organises the details of business of the House. TheOpposition has a Chief Whip, two salaried assistants and eight to ten non-salaried assistants. The task of the government Chief Whip is to act as contactbetween the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House (to both of whom he isresponsible) and Members. The whips (of all parties) keep Members informedabout the House’s business, and inform Members when they are obliged toattend the House. The degree of coercion of Members will depend on theimportance of the matter in hand. When attendance is required – and whenpolitical consequences will flow from non-attendance – a ‘three line whip’ isannounced. Where attendance is necessary, but not essential, a ‘two line whip’is applied. In order that Members are not unduly pressured by the need forattendance in parliament, the whips arrange ‘pairing’. Pairing is thearrangement whereby Members of government and opposition parties will belinked together: if one is absent the other may abstain from voting. Thus, thenon-attendance of one Member will be off-set – in the counting of votes – bythe absence of the other. It is this arrangement which is most frequentlythreatened when relationships between the government and Opposition breakdown. 
Much of the organisation of the business of the House is in the hands of
the whips, including planning the parliamentary timetable and advising onpractice and procedure. Whips of all parties are also responsible forrecommending candidates for membership of parliamentary committees. 
Members of Parliament
Front- and backbenchers
Business in the House is conducted on adversarial lines. The adversarialnature of the Commons is reflected in the layout of the House. The House isdivided into two sections which face each other, separated by the Table of theHouse, behind which the Speaker sits. Each side has a front-bench and severalrows of backbenches. On the side to the right of the Speaker sit Members ofthe government party, ministers of the government occupying the front-bench. Opposite, on the front-bench, will sit the shadow ministers of theOpposition party. All other Members of both the government and Oppositionwill sit on the backbenches: hence the term ‘backbenchers’.

The representation of women in the Commons
The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 made women eligible to
stand as Members of Parliament. Of 1,613 candidates at the 1918 election, only17 were women. The first female candidate to take her seat in the House ofCommons was Lady Astor, elected in 1919 in a by-election. The representationof women has always been poor in the Commons, as a sampling of the figuresshows. In 1918, there was just one woman Member; in 1929, this figure hadrisen to 14; and, in 1945, 24 women were elected to parliament. The figuresremain between 17 and 29 until 1987, when 41 women were elected. All themajor political parties are committed to increasing the representation ofwomen in the Commons. The 1997 general election resulted in a significantlyimproved proportion of women Members of Parliament. The total numberelected was 120 (18 per cent of 659 seats), with 101 Labour, 14 Conservative,three Liberal Democrat and two Scottish National Party Members, plus theSpeaker of the House of Commons. The 2001 general election returned 118women members.
The first woman to hold ministerial office was Margaret Bondfield. She
became the first female Member of Cabinet in 1929. Two women have held theoffice of Speaker: the Rt Hon Betty Harview in 1970, and Betty Boothroydfrom 1987. The first female Prime Minister was the Rt Hon Margaret ThatcherMP (as she then was), who held office from 1979–90, the longest premiershipin the twentieth century.
Salaries and allowances of Members of Parliament
As far back as the thirteenth century, representatives attending parliamentwere paid – either in cash or kind – and, in addition, had travelling expenses.Payment by electors had ceased by the end of the seventeenth century. In theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries, though unpaid, a seat in the House ofCommons was valuable, and could attract large sums of money for itspurchase. Members of Parliament remained formally unpaid until 1911,despite numerous previous attempts to introduce payment. In 1911, the salaryamounted to £400 per annum. In 1996, the Review Body on Senior Salaries,successor to the Top Salaries Review Board, recommended that Member’s payshould be increased by 26 per cent to £43,000 per annum. The government,however, proposed an increase of a mere three per cent. The House rejectedthe government’s proposal and agreed to the Review Body’srecommendation. The House also agreed that, from 1997, the yearly ratewould be increased by the average percentage of Senior Civil Service paybands. 
Members also receive allowances for secretarial and research assistance,
car mileage allowance, and for limited travel between the constituency andparliament. In addition, Members whose constituencies are within innerLondon are entitled to claim a London Supplement payment.Chapter 14: Constitutional and Administrative Law

465Members’ Code of conduct
Members of Parliament are governed by a Code of Conduct setting out
general principles to guide members on the standards of conduct that theHouse and the public have a right to expect.

The size of the House of Commons
Prior to the 1997 general election, the number of seats in parliament wasincreased from 651 to 659, as a result of constituency boundary changes. Overthe past 40 years, the number of parliamentary seats has increased by ten percent. If the number of parliamentary representatives is compared with thetotal population of the country, it can be seen that there is a wide discrepancyin the representativeness of differing legislatures. In Ireland, for example,there are 166 Members of Parliament, each representing 24,000 citizens. Bycontrast, in Australia, there are 147 Members, each representing 122,000citizens. In the United Kingdom, there are 659 Members of Parliament, eachrepresenting approximately 89,000 citizens.
Resignation of Members of Parliament
A Member, once duly elected, cannot relinquish his seat.21However,
provision is made whereby a Member may retire under differingprocedures,
22each of which involves accepting office under the Crown, which
obliges the Member to relinquish his seat on the basis of disqualification frommembership
23and a writ to be issued for a by-election. Application for the
office is normally granted,24although power remains for the application to be
refused. The offices are nowadays purely nominal and retained as a device toavoid the absence of any resignation procedure.
The political parties
The major political parties have a similar organisational structure inparliament. The Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties have asystem of election for the party leader, and are organised into front andbackbench Members. Looking at the Commons as a whole, we see that itcomprises the government, elected on the basis of the simple majority vote,

The 2001 general election resulted in the House of Commons being made upof 413 Labour Members, 166 Conservative Members, 52 Liberal DemocratMembers, and 28 Members from other minority parties.
GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION
It is the government which controls the majority of parliament’s time. On 75per cent of sitting days, government business takes priority and it is thegovernment which determines the business to be undertaken (subject toestablished practices as to Opposition Days, days set aside for PrivateMembers’ Bills, etc). From scrutinising the work of parliament, it may betempting to underplay the importance of parliament as a whole, and theOpposition in particular, in comparison with the power of the government.Such a view is implicit in the pejorative labelling of government as an ‘electivedictatorship’.
25Such charges need to be viewed with some caution. In 1947,
Sir Ivor Jennings described the role of the Opposition as ‘at once thealternative to the government and a focus for the discontent of the people. Itsfunction is almost as important as that of the government’.
26
In its constitutional role, the Opposition must constantly be questioning,
probing and calling government to account. Viewed in this light,notwithstanding the government’s control over the timetable and business ofthe House, it can be said that all parliamentary time is as much ‘Oppositiontime’ as ‘government time’.
The constitutional importance of the official Opposition is reflected in the
fact that the Leader of the Opposition draws a substantial salary in both theHouse of Commons and Lords, which is drawn on the Consolidated Fund.
27
In addition, since 1975, financial assistance has been provided to all oppositionparties to enable them to carry out their role effectively. Each party is entitledto a fixed sum per annum per seat won by the party, plus an amount for every200 votes cast in the previous election. 
The Opposition is allocated 20 days per session in which it can determine
the business of the day, representing in an average session 11.6 per cent ofparliamentary time. Following the Queen’s Speech at the opening of a newparliamentary session, the Opposition has the right to determine the subjectsfor debate on the second of the six days set aside for debate on the speech.

Introduction to the House of Commons
In addition to normal parliamentary procedure for debate, questions, etc,
and opposition time, the Opposition has the weapon of the motion of censure
– or vote of no confidence. The motion takes the form of ‘the House has noconfidence in Her Majesty’s Government’. By convention, the governmentalways makes time for debate on the motion, a three line whip will beemployed, and a division (a formal vote – see below) invariably takes place.While fairly infrequent and confined to serious matters of policy, the loss of amotion of confidence can, as in 1979, lead to the resignation of thegovernment, and such motions are always regarded as importantparliamentary occasions. 
*Liberal Democrat motions
VOTING IN THE COMMONS
A ‘division’ is the name for the counting of votes on important issues whereconflict is apparent. Not every debate will result in a division: divisions arereserved for instances when it is important to register formally the number ofvotes for and against a particularly important issue. In the 1992–93 session,

401 divisions were ordered; in 2000–01 (a short session), 209 divisions were
ordered. For the observer, there is something archaic and humourous aboutthe procedure. The Speaker orders ‘Division: clear the lobbies’. Division bellssound throughout parliament and in the division district immediatelysurrounding parliament. Members will interrupt whatever they are doing inresponse to the bell and return to parliament for the vote. Members crowdinto the ‘Aye’ or ‘Noe’ lobby, and as they exit the lobby their attendance ischecked. The Speaker then announces the result of the division. Votes arerecorded by name in the Official Journal of the House of Commons.
Pairing
Not every Member must be present for every division. Provided that theMember has agreed with a Member of an opposing party not to participate inthe division, he or she is excused since the absence of both Members will notaffect the overall result. Pairing arrangements must be registered with theParty Whips. Pairing is not permitted in relation to divisions on the mostimportant matters.

broadcasting of its proceedings by television.29

PROPOSED REFORMS
In 2001, the Leader of the House of Commons proposed several reforms to theworkings of the House. Among proposals being considered is thatappointments to Select Committees should no longer be controlled by theparty whips but determined by a panel of senior MPs. Also on the agenda areplans for shorter debates, morning sittings, moving Prime Minister’sQuestions from 3 pm on Wednesdays to midday, an end to the long summerrecess and the introduction of electronic voting. On Question Time it isproposed that the two week period of notice of questions should be reduced.Also proposed is that Select Committees should consider more Bills and thatthey should also have powers to monitor the operation of legislation. On thelegislative process, it has been proposed that Bills should be allowed to carryover from one parliament to the next, with a maximum period of 12 months,during which they must pass through both Houses. With more morningsittings designed to minimise the need for late night sittings, the total numberof hours worked would be longer than at present. The plans were submittedto the Commons’ Modernisation Committee.

CHAPTER 15
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Approximately two-thirds of the time of the House of Commons is devoted to
the consideration of proposals for legislation.2In order to effect changes in the
law, any proposal must receive the authority of parliament. Parliamentlegitimises policy objectives. A mere decision of parliament, in the form of aResolution of the Commons, cannot change the law of the land.
3In order to
become law, a legislative proposal must receive the consent of the threecomponent parts of parliament: the Commons, the Lords
4and the Crown
through the giving of the royal assent. In this chapter the process of scrutinyin the House of Commons is considered. Discussion of the legislative role ofthe House of Lords is to be found in Chapter 17. 
Before examining the process of scrutiny in the Commons, the various
types of legislation must be considered. Legislative proposals fall under twomain categories: primary and delegated (or secondary) legislation. Primarylegislation refers to Acts of Parliament. Delegated or secondary legislationrefers to legislation drafted by authorised persons or bodies under theauthority of a ‘parent’ statute.
WESTMINSTER AND DEVOLUTION
As seen in Chapter 12, devolution to the Northern Ireland Assembly, ScottishParliament and, to a lesser extent, the Welsh Assembly (which has no powerto enact primary legislation), represents a diminution in Westminster’slegislative role. Under devolution, in practical terms, the United KingdomParliament retains power to enact primary legislation only to the extent towhich this power has not passed to the regional legislature.

PRIMARY LEGISLATION5
The classification of Bills
The majority of Bills will be those put forward by the government to
implement its policy. Bills fall into four categories: Public Bills, Private Bills,Hybrid Bills and Money Bills. The procedure for passing the Bill differsaccording to the classification of a Bill. Most attention is here devoted to thelegislative procedure for Public Bills. 
A Public Bill is one which has general application to all members of
society, for example, Road Traffic Acts, Environmental Protection Acts,National Health Service Acts. A Private Bill is one which affects only anindividual or bodies in society, such as local authorities. 
A Hybrid Bill is one of general application, that is to say a Public Bill,
which also affects particular private interests in a manner different from theprivate interests of other persons or bodies of the same category or class. TheBill regulating the development of the Channel Tunnel is an example of aHybrid Bill, since it affected the private rights of landowners whose landwould be compulsorily purchased.
6
A Money Bill is one which is certified by the Speaker as such, and is one
which contains nothing other than financial measures. 
A Private Members’ Bill is one promoted by an individual Member of
Parliament, as opposed to the government7or, alternatively, a matter which
the government has been unable to fit into its legislative programme but willsubsequently adopt and provide time – and support – for the passage of theBill. Most often, such Bills involve sensitive issues of particular interest to theirpromoters. The Abortion Act 1967, for example, originated from a PrivateMembers’ Bill. Private Members’ Bills follow the same legislative process asgovernment Bills, but the time available for their consideration is restricted.Normally, ten (although, occasionally more) Fridays each session will be setaside for Private Members’ Bills, and it is rare for a Bill to succeed unless thegovernment is prepared to provide additional time for its consideration. 
Consolidation Bills represent a re-enactment of legislation in a
comprehensive manner and they enable previous legislation – which willgenerally exist in several statutes – to be repealed. Consolidation Bills do not,for the most part, represent any change in the law; rather, they represent thechance to ‘consolidate’ all the law on a particular matter within one statute.Consolidation Bills are normally introduced in the House of Lords and thenscrutinised by a Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, comprised ofMembers of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Since thereChapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
4725 See Rose, 1986; Hansard Society, 1993.
6 See, also, London (Transport) Bill 1968–69; Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Bill 1986–87.
7 See Griffith and Ryle, 1989, pp 385–400; Marsh and Read, 1988.

The Legislative Process
is no change being made in the substantive law, parliamentary time devoted
to Consolidation Bills is short and it is rare for a Consolidation Bill to bedebated more than briefly on the floor of the Commons. In 1994, the House ofCommons agreed that, in order to save further time, Consolidated Bills wouldno longer require a committee stage. Finally, there are Consolidated Fund andAppropriation Bills which provide statutory authority for governmentexpenditure and which are not debated in parliament. 
The legislative picture cannot be complete without consideration of
delegated or subordinate legislation. In the decade 1980–90, an average of 62Bills were enacted each session, and the average number of statutoryinstruments (see, further, below) amounted to 2,000 per session. In addition,administrative rules drafted by government departments must be considered.These include Codes of Practice, Circulars and Guidances and, while they donot have the force of law, they nevertheless have an impact on the manner inwhich laws are implemented.
8
The origins of legislation
The majority of Bills considered by parliament will be introduced by thegovernment of the day. This does not mean that the source of the proposal isone emanating from government policy, still less from the party manifesto onwhich the election was fought. Between 1970–74, only eight per cent of Billswere attributable to the Conservative Party Manifesto, and between 1974–79,only 13 per cent of Bills were attributable to the Labour Party Manifesto.
9In
1981, 75 per cent of Bills originated within government departments, and theremainder were responses to particular events. Illustrations of reactivelegislative proposals include the War Damage Bill 1964–65, introduced rapidlyto nullify the effect of the House of Lords’ decision in Burmah Oil v Lord
Advocate (1964) (see, further, Chapter 7); the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1974, passed in response to the Birmingham pubbombing by the Irish Republican Army; the Dangerous Dogs Act 1990, aresponse to the increased numbers of dogs causing serious injury, particularlyto children. 
Consideration of the origins of legislative proposals is important in
evaluating the extent to which government and the House of Commonsinteracts with the society it is elected to serve. As John Stuart Mill said inRepresentative Government (1861), parliament is ‘the sounding board of the
nation’. JAG Griffith and M Ryle express the same idea when they observethat parliament is ‘the recipient of a wide range of external pressures andproposals’:
4738 Eg, Guidance to Local Authorities on the Provision of Sites for Gypsies under the
Caravan Sites Act 1968; Guidance on Allocation of Local Authority Housing under the
Housing Act 1985. See Baldwin and Houghton, 1986; Ganz, 1987.
9 Rose, 1984.

It is a central feature of Parliament, however, that it performs a responsive
rather than initiating function within the constitution. The government – atdifferent levels – initiates policy, formulates its policy on legislation and otherproposals, exercises powers under the prerogative or granted by statute and, inall these aspects, performs the governing role in the State. Both Houses ofParliament spend most of their time responding, in a variety of ways, to theseinitiatives, proposals or executive actions. [1989, p 5]
The government, however, is not the only source of input of business for
parliament. Much business originates from the Opposition front-bench, andfrom backbenchers on either side of the two Houses. The inspiration for theirinput is largely found in general public opinion, outside pressures or interestgroups, newspapers, radio and television, and in the minds and attitudes ofmillions of citizens represented in the Commons by Members.
Parliament, therefore, finds itself the recipient of a wide range of external
pressures and proposals, broadly divided in origin between the governmentof the day on the one hand and the outside world – the public – on the other.
10
Professor Finer (1958) labels the forces external to parliament which have
an impact on its working as the ‘anonymous empire’. Finer is here referring toall those individuals and organisations, lobby groups and interest groupswhose aim is to influence the content of legislation. Finer claims that thedetailed programme of government legislation ‘owes a great deal to sectionalgroups’. Amongst these groups, we can include such organisations as theConfederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’Unions, National Union of Teachers, the British Medical Association, and theLaw Society, each of which is engaged in promoting its own sectionalinterests. Other pressure groups pursue particular causes: for example, theRoyal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, JUSTICE (theInternational Commission of Jurists), Howard League for Penal Reform,Friends of the Earth (environmental issues), Shelter (housing). 
In addition to these and many other groups, the law reform bodies
provide a source of legislation. The Law Commission, established under theLaw Commissions Act 1965, is under a duty to keep the law under reviewwith a view to its systematic development and reform, including codificationof law, and simplification and modernisation of law (section 3). If we take, byway of example, the Law Commission’s work on family law, the Commissionhas reviewed the law of legitimacy, custody, wardship, divorce, domesticviolence and occupation of the matrimonial home. In conjunction with inter-departmental committees, the Law Commission has been engaged in acomprehensive review of adoption law. Between 1965–88 the LawCommission had published 111 reports, 71 of which were given legal effect infull or in part. Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
47410 Griffith and Ryle, 1989, p 5.

The Legislative Process
Commissions of inquiry may be established by the government to examine
and report on particular issues, often culminating in a change in the law. For
example, the Committee of Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland (in part)resulted in changes implemented in the Children Act 1989 which representeda major overhaul of the law relating to children. The Criminal Law RevisionCommittee, has examined the law relating, inter alia, to conspiracy, contempt,
arrest and detention, and criminal deception.
Each of these sources may result in proposals for changes in the law. The
success of these proposals in terms of becoming law is largely dependentupon the government of the day and its willingness to provide parliamentarytime for the consideration of Bills. In any parliamentary session,approximately 50–60 Bills will be introduced, the vast majority of which willreach the statute book.
The preparation of a Bill
Once the government has decided to implement a particular measure, theaims of government must be translated effectively into language which willachieve those objectives. That task is entrusted to parliamentary draftsmen, orparliamentary counsel, attached to the Management and Personnel Office ofthe Treasury.
11Drafting involves five stages: understanding, analysis, design,
composition and revision.12Once a draft Bill is in being, it is examined by the
Cabinet Home Affairs Committee before being formally submitted toparliament for scrutiny and enactment.
The structure of a Bill
Each Bill has a short title, for example, the Transport Bill, which indicates thegeneral area of policy involved, together with a long title which summarisesthe main objectives of the Bill. The Bill is made up of Chapters or Parts whichencompass groups of related clauses, and Schedules which contain detailssupplementary to the primary clauses. The Bill may grant powers to makedelegated legislation to ministers or other specified bodies, such as localauthorities. There is, necessarily, no uniformity as to the length of Bills, whichmay range from one clause (Abortion Amendment Bill 1988–89), to 27 Parts,747 clauses and 25 Schedules (Companies Bill 1985). 
The legislative stages: Public Bills
First reading
A Bill which is to be introduced will appear on the Order Paper of the relevantday. The Bill will be presented in ‘dummy form’ and is deemed to be read a
47511 SI 1981/1670.
12 Thornton, 1987, pp 116–17.

‘first time’. Alternatively, a Bill may be introduced on order of the House, or
after having been sent to the Commons following its passage by the House ofLords. Following the purely formal introduction into parliament, a date willbe set for second reading and the Bill will be printed and published.
Second reading
It is at the second reading that a Bill will receive the first in depth scrutiny.The scrutiny occurs in the form of a debate, generally on the floor of theHouse, and is confined to matters of principle rather than detail.Exceptionally, the second reading debate may be referred to a committee forconsideration, but may only be so referred if 20 or more Members ofParliament do not object and, accordingly, the procedure is reserved for non-controversial matters and not measures ‘involving large questions of policynor likely to give rise to differences on party lines’.
13Where a Bill has been
committed to a second reading committee, the committee considers theprinciples of the Bill, but the vote on the Bill is taken on the floor of theHouse.
14It is at second reading stage that the minister in charge of the Bill
must explain and defend the contents of the Bill. The Opposition’s task is toprobe and question and set out reasons for opposing the Bill. It should not beassumed that the Opposition invariably opposes Bills. In many instances, theproposed legislation is uncontroversial and may even be welcomed by theOpposition. The Dangerous Dogs Bill and the Child Support Bill 1990 areillustrations of this phenomena. If the Bill is opposed, a vote will take placewhich determines the fate of the Bill. If the vote is lost, the Bill is rejected andthe proposed legislation must either be abandoned or the Bill must bereintroduced at a later date. 
Once a Bill has successfully completed the second reading stage, it ‘stands
committed’ to a standing committee, unless, exceptionally, the House ordersotherwise.
15Bills of constitutional importance may ‘stand committed’ to a
Committee of the Whole House, or the Bill may be divided and partconsidered by a Committee of the Whole House and part in standingcommittee. A Bill may also be referred to a special standing committee or to aselect committee, although, as seen below, this is rare.
Public Bills which are to give effect to proposals contained in a report by
either of the Law Commissions, other than a Private Members’ Bill or aConsolidation Bill, when set down for second reading will be committed to asecond reading committee, unless the House orders otherwise, or the Bill isreferred to the Northern Ireland, Scottish or Welsh Grand Committee. If aminister of the Crown moves a motion that a Bill not be referred to a secondreading committee, the House will vote on the motion.Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Legislative Process
Committee stage 
Standing committees are designed to scrutinise Bills in detail. The name is in
fact a misnomer, for it implies that these are permanent committees, whereasin fact they are not. The committee will be established for the purpose ofexamining a particular Bill and will then stand down, a feature which, as willbe seen, may have implications for the adequacy of scrutiny.
At any one time, there will be eight to ten standing committees in
operation. Committees may comprise between 16 and 50 Members ofParliament, and normally between 18 and 25.
16Membership is drawn from
Members of Parliament from all political parties and is proportionate to theoverall strength of the party in the House, thus, the larger the government’smajority in the House, the larger its majority in the standing committee.Appointments are made by a Committee of Selection who will take advicefrom party whips as to appropriate Members. The Speaker of the Houseappoints the Chairman of the standing committee, who may be a Member ofeither side of the House (government or Opposition). Once selected, theChairman is impartial and enjoys the same powers as the Speaker of theHouse in relation to selection of amendments for discussion and imposition ofthe Closure Motion (see further, below, p 482). 
The function of the standing committee is to examine the Bill clause by
clause. The minister in charge of the Bill has the task of steering it successfullythrough committee, aided by his Parliamentary Private Secretary and civilservants. Amendments may be proposed by Members giving notice to thePublic Bill Office of the House of Commons. These amendments may take theform of linguistic details, adding or subtracting a word here or there;alternatively, amendments may be of major substance. Once the clauses of theBill have been considered, the committee moves to consider any proposednew clauses. Proposals for amendment may be ruled out of order if they areirrelevant, beyond the scope of the Bill, conflict with other proposedamendments, conflict with the principle of the Bill or are unintelligible,ineffective, vague or spurious.
17
The proceedings in standing committee are formal and ritualistic. A
Member moves an amendment, the minister responds, the Opposition speaks,other Members comment, and debate continues until a decision on a clause –‘that the clause do stand part of the Bill’ – is reached. The minister’s task is toensure a smooth passage for the Bill in the fastest possible time. RichardCrossman,
18Minister of Housing and Local Government in the Labour
government of 1974, commented that committee stage is tedious with the
47716 Complex Bills may warrant a larger committee membership, as with the Finance Bill
1992.

minister ‘being pinned to the wall’ throughout the process. For the most part,
deliberations will follow party political lines, and it follows that, provided thegovernment has a majority on the committee, the chances of successfullymoving amendments is slight. 
The low success rate of backbench proposals for amendment should not be
given disproportionate weight. It has been seen above that Standing Ordersset out a number of ‘inadmissible’ categories of proposed amendments. Itmust also be noted that Members may put forward amendments solely with aview to gaining a clearer picture of the Bill, or for more spurious reasons, suchas delaying a Bill or embarrassing the government. Equally, it should beremembered that the composition of the committee reflects that of the Houseoverall: governments with a firm majority will inevitably suffer fewer defeatsin committee. Finally, recognition must be given to the fact that thegovernment has gained a mandate in a general election and, whether or not aspecific legislative proposal stems from that mandate, the government has alegitimate expectation of getting its legislative programme on the statute book.Equally, the principle of the Bill has been approved on second reading by theHouse. While parliament as a whole, through its representative committee,has the equally legitimate expectation of being able to give adequate scrutinyto government proposals, that should not necessarily be understood to meanthat standing committees should expect to be able to force their views ongovernment. 
That said, there have long been criticisms of the effectiveness of standing
committees. It has been noted above that the minister in charge of the Bill,together with his civil service advisers, steers the Bill through committee. Anyminister not totally in charge of his subject matter will have a short ministerialcareer, and it is essential that the minister should have a command of hissubject and the necessary advice to hand to fend off Opposition attacks. It isinevitable, therefore, that there will be a disparity of information and expertisebetween the minister and other members of the committee, and that this willaffect the adequacy of scrutiny. Further, the shortcomings of standingcommittees may be exacerbated by their non-specialist composition. 
At first sight, it appears anomalous that there is no standing committee
system organised on specialist lines. There is a prima facie case for committees
to be geared to particular subjects, or groups of subjects. On this reasoning, astanding committee could be devised with the remit to consider transportmatters, another to consider science and technology Bills, another to considerenvironmental issues and so on. If such committees were appointed for thelife of the parliament, or for a parliamentary session with Members appointedon the basis of their expertise and interests, the potential for improvedscrutiny would be enhanced. However, there is a counter-argument to this. Aspecialist semi-permanent committee, while having the benefit of expertise,would lose the quality of the assortment of interests which is currentlybrought to bear on proposals. Members of the committee might become tooChapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Legislative Process
familiar with each others’ attitudes, and ministers and the committee could
suffer from becoming inward looking and overly concerned with one subjectto the neglect of others. Committees are open to the public and theirproceedings are recorded in the Official Report of the House, Hansard . For
debate to become too narrow and technical might disadvantage otherMembers and the public in their capacity to understand proceedings.
One recognised shortcoming in standing committee procedure is the lack
of power to send for ‘persons and papers’, in other words, witnesses anddocuments. For Members who are not specialists in the subject matter or instatutory drafting and interpretation, the task of understanding the content ofa complex Bill, its implications for other aspects of the law and therelationship between various Parts and Clauses can be daunting. This was aprocedural aspect examined by Professor Griffith, who recommendedreform.
19The Procedure Committee20examined this perceived difficulty and
recommended that a hybrid committee displaying the normal features of astanding committee but adopting some of the procedures and powers of selectcommittees be introduced. A Standing Order, passed by the House in 1986,provides that within the first 28 days of a Bill being committed to the SpecialStanding Committee, written and oral evidence may be taken. A furthercommittee sitting can be devoted to debate on the evidence given to thecommittee. At this preliminary stage, the committee is acting as a Committeeof Inquiry, attempting to see the Bill in its entirety and to evaluate itssubstance and implications. Following the inquiry period, the committeereverts to ordinary standing committee procedure. In the experimental periodfrom 1980–85, only five Bills were committed to Special Standing Committees.In 1985 in debate, the Leader of the House, Mr John Biffen, reported that theviews of ministers on the new procedure were mixed, some finding it helpful,others considering it irksome. In light of the pressure on parliamentary timeand the reluctance of ministers to be ‘tied up’ in committee proceedings, it isunlikely that Special Standing Committees will become the standard form ofprocedure for the scrutiny of Bills.
Other Bills may be referred to Second Reading Committees, under the
procedure outlined above. Neither major nor controversial Bills are referred toSecond Reading Committees. Many of these Bills will already have passedthrough the House of Lords. 
Report stage21
Once the Bill has been considered in standing committee, the Bill is reportedback to the House of Commons as a whole. If amendments have been made incommittee, the Bill will be reprinted. Further amendments may be introduced
47919 Griffith, 1973.
20 See Chapter 16.
21 See Griffith and Ryle, 1989, pp 235–36.

at this stage, but the Speaker will be careful to avoid repetition of the debate in
standing committee, so any proposed amendments previously considered willbe rejected. The Speaker will accept amendments proposed by thegovernment, proposals representing a compromise and amendments relatingto new developments. Generally, the debate at this stage will be brief but,again, this will depend on the importance of the Bill. The Police and CriminalEvidence Bill, for example, was debated for eighteen and a half hours at reportstage. Approximately nine per cent of time on the floor of the House is takenup with report.
Third reading
Third reading represents the last chance for the House of Commons toexamine a Bill before it is passed to the House of Lords. At this stage, the Billcannot be amended, other than to correct small mistakes such as grammaticalor printing errors. A Bill may pass through the report and third reading stagesat the same time.

PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BILLS22
Introducing a Private Members’ Bill
In addition to Public (and Private and Hybrid) Bills, a number of legislative
proposals will be introduced by individual Members of Parliament. In anyone session, dozens of Private Members Bills will be introduced, a minority ofwhich will reach the statute book. A Private Members’ Bill may be introducedin one of four ways. The first procedure is that of the ballot.Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
48022 See Marsh and Read, 1988.

The Legislative Process
Introduction by ballot
The House will agree, early in the session, for days to be appointed for the
purpose of the Ballot. Members of Parliament may put their names on theBallot Paper on that day. Over 400 Members normally enter the Ballot,although many will have no specific proposed legislation in mind. TwentyMembers will be successful at the Ballot. If successful, the Member must then,within nine days, table the subject matter for his or her Bill. Six Fridays persession are allocated to Private Members’ Bills, on which days the Bills takeprecedence over other parliamentary business.
Introduction under Standing Order procedure
Any Member may present a Bill under this procedure by placing the long andshort title of the Bill on the Order Paper of the House. The Bill will not beconsidered, but simply be deemed to have received a first reading and a dateset for second reading. 
Introduction under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’
A Member may give notice of a motion for leave to introduce a Bill. Themotions will be considered at specific times allotted by the House, whichpermits the Member to raise an issue after Question Time on Tuesdays andWednesdays, thus guaranteeing media attention.
23Several rules apply. The
Member may give one notice at any one time. No notice may be given forleave to bring in a Bill which relates to taxation or expenditure, or to bring in aBill which covers matters which are substantially the same as those containedin Bills on which the House has already reached a decision in that session. 
‘Ordinary presentation’ of a Bill
Every Member is permitted to introduce a Bill after having given notice. TheseBills, however, are not presented until after the Ballot Bills have beenpresented and put down for second reading. They therefore have little chanceof success. Nor do they enjoy the publicity given to Bills introduced under theTen Minute Rule. 
48123 Usually, on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before the start of public business.

Introduction of a Bill after consideration in the House of Lords
Most Private Members’ Bills are introduced in the House of Commons, but a
small number each session may have started their parliamentary life in theLords. If the Bill passes the Lords, it then comes to the Commons. However,Bills introduced in the Lords are considered only after Bills introduced in theCommons and, accordingly, given the severe time constraints, few are likelyeven to receive a second reading in the Commons. 
The enactment of Private Members’ Bills
The success, or otherwise, of a Private Members’ Bill is largely dependentupon it receiving government support. As has been seen in Chapter 14, thegovernment controls the parliamentary timetable, and dominatesparliamentary business. Since only six Fridays per session are allocated forconsideration of Private Members’ Bills, it will be necessary for thegovernment to make additional time for the completion of its parliamentarystages. Whether or not the government is willing to do this will depend uponthe political support which the Bill acquires. However, even if a Bill does notsuccessfully pass all its legislative stages, it may have served the usefulpurpose of heightening parliamentary and public awareness of a particularissue. For example, the Rt Hon Tony Benn MP has introduced PrivateMembers’ Bills, inter alia, on placing the royal prerogative on a statutory
basis,
24and for enacting a written constitution.25Neither of these has
succeeded, but represent matters in which there is widespread interest. 
Curtailing debate on legislative proposals
As a result of the pressure on parliamentary time, and the need for a Bill topass through all its legislative stages in a single session, procedures exist tolimit consideration of a Bill. 
Closure Motions
The Closure Motion, introduced in 1881, is a means of stopping debate,usually by agreement between government and Opposition, in order toensure that debates end at times agreed by the parties. The closure can beused in debate on the floor of the House or in standing committee. It is aninstrument of control, and one which is used sparingly: rarely will it be usedwithout agreement. In the 1987–88 session, however (a long session), it wasused 20 times without inter-party agreement. Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
48224 Crown Prerogatives (House of Commons Control) Bill 1988–89.
25 Commonwealth of Britain Bill.

The Legislative Process
In terms of procedure, the motion for closure is put to the Speaker who has
discretion whether or not to accept the motion. In addition, at least 100
Members of Parliament must vote in favour of closure. 
Selection of amendments
This device is confined to legislative proposals and enables the procedure tobe streamlined by the selection of amendments for discussion.
The Allocation of Time Motion
The most extreme form of control is the Allocation of Time Motion,colloquially called the Guillotine Motion, introduced in its present form in1887. Erskine May (1997) describes Guillotine Motions as representing:
... the extreme limit to which procedure goes in affirming the rights of the
majority at the expense of the minorities of the House, and it cannot be deniedthat they are capable of being used in such a way as to upset the balance,generally so carefully preserved, between the claims of business, and the rightsof debate.
The device, if approved by the House, enables the government to set a date by
which a Bill is to be reported from standing committee to the House, or a datefor third reading. If the government puts forward a motion for an Allocationof Time, Standing Orders provide that a debate of up to three hours may takeplace (which may be extended), unless otherwise proposed in the motion ordecided by the Business Committee of the House. Once agreed, the BusinessCommittee of the House, or a business sub-committee of the StandingCommittee will determine how many scrutiny sessions are to be held and thedate by which the next procedural stage must be accomplished.
Between 1881–1921, 36 Bills were guillotined, between 1921–45, 30. The
highest number of Bills guillotined in any one session, ten, was in the 1988–89session. In respect of many Bills, the guillotine will be applied more than once,and can apply to any stage of the legislative process. The Dangerous Dogs Bill1990–91, for example, regarded by the government as an urgent matter, wasguillotined twice with the effect that the second reading debate, the committeestage, report and third reading and the consideration of amendments from theHouse of Lords were all subject to strict time limits. 
In the 1998–99 session, 12 Bills were subject to the Allocation of Time
Motion. In the 2000–2001 session, Orders of the House provided thatProgramme Motions should be employed to facilitate efficiency in thelegislative process. The Modernisation Committee stated that the basicrequirements of the reformed system were to ensure that the government getsits legislation through in a reasonable time while allowing the opposition andMembers to have a full opportunity to debate and propose amendments.Further, it was essential that all parts of the Bill be properly considered, andthat there should be an improvement in the preparation of Bills so as to reducethe need for amendments. The statistics for the 2000–01 session combine the
483

use of the Allocation of Time Motion and the Programme Motion. Guillotine
or Programme Motions were used 34 times on 22 Bills during the session.26
For the most part, the Guillotine Motion is used sparingly and will,
generally, be applied only after a considerable amount of time has been spenton the Bill in committee and the government is at risk of losing the Billaltogether.
27For example, the Housing Bill of 1979–80 and the Social Security
Bill of 1985–86 had both spent over 100 hours in committee before theAllocation of Time Motion was moved. Moreover, the Police and CriminalEvidence Bill 1983–84 had no guillotine applied despite having 59 sittings instanding committee. 
If the government chooses to move an Allocation of Time Motion, it is a
rare occurrence for it to lose the vote. In 1977, the Labour government movedan Allocation of Time Motion on the Scotland and Wales Bill 1976–77 but,following a six hour debate, the vote was lost by 312 votes to 283 and thegovernment withdrew the Bill.
The use of the guillotine procedure undeniably limits the effectiveness of
parliamentary scrutiny of Bills and may result in Bills leaving the House ofCommons with significant portions unexamined. This point must be borne inmind when assessing the role and value of the House of Lords in thelegislative process. 
DELEGATED LEGISLATION
The picture of the law making process would be incomplete without aconsideration of delegated, or subordinate, legislation. 
In 1972, Parliament’s Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation described
subordinate legislation as covering ‘every exercise of power to legislateconferred by or under an Act of Parliament’.
28Some examples will make the
scope of delegated legislation clearer.
Delegated legislation may be made by:
(a)ministers , in the form of rules and regulations which supplement the
provisions of an Act of Parliament;
(b) local authorities, in the form of bylaws to regulate their locality according toparticular localised needs;
(c) public bodies, in the form of rules and regulations. Such bodies include theBritish Airways Authority (section 9 of the Airport Authorities Act 1975);British Railways Board (section 67 of the Transport Act 1962); and theNature Conservancy Council (section 37 of the Wildlife and CountrysideAct 1981);Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law

28Report of the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation, HL 184, HC 475, 1971–72, London:
HMSO, para 6.

(d)judges, in the form of rules of court made under the authority of section 75
of the Supreme Court Act 1981;
(e)government departments , in the form of codes of practice, circulars and
guidance. These do not contain legal rules, but have a substantive effect onthe manner in which the legal rules operate;
(f) House of Commons, in the form of Resolutions of the House. TheProvisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 makes possible the lawfulimposition and collection of taxation between the Budget speech and theenactment of the Finance Bill in July/August. Whereas normal Resolutionsof the House do not have the force of law, Resolutions enabling theimpositions and collections of taxation – being authorised by statute –have legal effect.
The volume of delegated legislation also reveals its importance as a source oflaw. In any parliamentary year, between 1,500 and 3,000 pieces of delegatedlegislation will be approved.
The use of delegated law making power is not a purely modern
phenomenon, arising from increasing legal regulation of all aspects of life. Thepower to make subordinate legislation was exercised as early as the sixteenthcentury.
29The increase in the volume of delegated legislation derives from the
early nineteenth century. AV Dicey approved of delegated legislation. InDicey’s view:
The cumbersomeness and prolixity of English statute is due in no small
measure to futile endeavours of Parliament to work out the details of largelegislative changes ... the substance no less than the form of law would, it isprobable, be a good deal improved if the executive government of Englandcould, like that of France, by means of decrees, ordinances, or proclamationshaving the force of law, work out the detailed application of the generalprinciples embodied in the Acts of the legislature. [(1898), 1959, pp 52–53]
If satisfaction and approval of delegated legislation was widespread at the
time of Dicey’s writing, strongly opposing views were being expressed beforelong. Chief Justice Hewart, in The New Despotism (1929), argued that the
increased use of delegated legislation, particularly during the First World Warunder the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, amounted to an effective usurpationof the sovereign law making powers of parliament. Such criticisms led to theappointment, in 1929, of a committee
30of inquiry to consider the powers
exercised by ministers by way of delegated legislation and to report whatsafeguards are desirable or necessary to secure the constitutional principles ofthe sovereignty of parliament and the supremacy of the law.
The committee’s report,
31while recognising the need for improved
parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation, nevertheless, emphasised theThe Legislative Process

necessity of it in terms of legislative efficiency. It is efficiency which is the
principal justification for the delegation of law making power. Put simply,parliament, as currently constituted, struggles to give adequate scrutiny toprimary legislation. To burden parliament with the task of scrutinising everydetail of legislation would overload the parliamentary timetable to the extentthat the system would break under the strain. A related justification fordelegated power lies in the need to supplement or amend the primary rules inlight of new developments. Delegated legislation enables the fine tuning ofthe primary rules to take place, without encumbering parliament as a whole.Further, it may be that the government is clear as to the broad policy to bepursued under an Act, and as to the primary legal rules necessary to achieve aparticular goal. There may be less certainty as to the technical, detailed rulesnecessary: the delegation of law making power enables such rules to beworked out, often in consultation with specialist interest groups outsideparliament.
The justifications for subordinate legislation can hold good only if the
powers granted are sufficiently clear and precise as to be adjudicated upon bythe courts by way of judicial review
32and if the parliamentary scrutiny
accorded to it is adequate. 
Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the validity of Acts of
Parliament cannot be questioned.33Subordinate legislation, however, can be
reviewed, provided that the jurisdiction of the courts has not been excluded –or ‘ousted’ – in order to determine its compatibility with the enabling Act.Such exclusion of review is rare and, to ensure immunity from review, theexclusion clause would have to be unambiguous on the face of the parent Act.Of equal importance to the possibility of successful challenge in the courts isthe breadth of discretion conferred on the delegate by the Act. If a statuteconferred powers on a minister to make regulations ‘whenever the ministerthinks fit’ or (say) to award compensation for injury ‘under circumstances tobe determined by the minister’, the grant of discretion is so wide as to bevirtually unreviewable by the courts. Also important is that delegatedlegislation should not impose retrospective liability on citizens, or be so vagueas to be unintelligible. Further, it is necessary that the power granted isconferred on an identifiable delegate in order that the exercise of power bechallengeable. On this latter point, the Emergency Powers Act 1939 providedfor differing levels of delegation. The Act provided that regulations mightempower any authority on persons to make orders, rules and bylaws, for anyof the purposes for which the Defence Regulations might themselves bemade. Ministerial orders were issued under the regulations, directions issuedunder the regulations and licences issued under the directions. Suchsubdelegation breaches the rule that a person or body to whom powers areentrusted may not delegate them to another, ‘delegatus non potest delegare’.Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
48632 See Chapters 24 and 25.
33Pickin v British Railways Board (1974). See Chapter 7.

The Legislative Process
The Statutory Instruments Act 1946 
The vast majority of delegated legislation is in the form of statutory
instruments governed by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. Section 1provides that where any Act confers power on His Majesty in Council or onany minister of the Crown, where that power is expressed as a powerexercisable by Order in Council or by statutory instrument, the provisions ofthis Act apply thereto. 
Parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation34
The Statutory Instruments Act 1946 lays down the means by which aninstrument may come into effect, but the method adopted will depend on thatwhich is stipulated in the particular enabling Act. First, the parent Act mayprovide that the instrument be laid before parliament
35but that no
parliamentary action is needed. Secondly, the parent Act may provide that theinstrument is subject to the ‘negative resolution procedure’.
36Under this
procedure, the instrument can be laid before parliament in its final form andcome into immediate effect subject only to there being a successful move toannul the instrument. This move takes the form of a motion, known here as a‘prayer’ for annulment of the instrument, which can be made within 40 daysof the instrument being laid. Thirdly, the enabling Act may stipulate that theinstrument be laid in draft form and that it will come into effect only if aprayer for annulment is not moved successfully. The Statutory InstrumentsAct also provides for an ‘affirmative resolution procedure’. If this is adopted,the instrument may either come into immediate effect, subject to subsequentapproval by parliament, or be laid in draft form to come into effect ifapproved by parliament.
The choice of the procedure to be adopted lies with the government. The
problem posed for parliament is again one of time and opportunity. Theaffirmative resolution procedure is rarely adopted by government; thenegative resolution procedure requires that Members of Parliament must bevigilant and astute if they (usually the Opposition) are to be aware that aparticular instrument has been laid and are to be able to move a prayer forannulment within the 40 day period. Instruments made under the EuropeanCommunities Act 1972 to give effect to Community law may be subject toeither the affirmative or negative procedure.
Since 1994–95, instruments subject to affirmative resolution are
automatically referred to a standing committee, unless the House ordersotherwise. Instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure, to whicha prayer has been tabled, may be referred to a standing committee on a

Motion by a minister of the Crown. 
Supplementing the above scrutiny methods is the Joint Select Committee
on Delegated Legislation The Joint Committee comprises seven Members of
the House of Commons and seven Members of the House of Lords, and ischaired by a member of the House of Commons. The committee is chargedwith examining all instruments laid before parliament and those instrumentsfor which there is no laying requirement. The grounds on which thecommittee will report to parliament are:
(a) that the instrument imposes a tax or charge;
(b) that the parent Act excludes review by the courts;(c) that the instrument is to operate retrospectively;(d) that there has been unjustifiable delay in publication or laying;(e) that the instrument has come into effect in contravention of the rules of
notice to the House;
(f) that there is doubt as to whether the instrument is intra vires;
(g) that the instrument requires clarification;(h) that the instrument’s drafting is defective.
The committee examines over 1,000 instruments per session. Less than one per
cent are reported to parliament and few are debated. The strength of thecommittee’s work lies not in its reports to parliament and any consequentaction but rather in its scrutiny of instruments and drawing attention todefects in instruments to the relevant government department. 
The Report of the Committee on Ministers’ Powers, in 1932,
37emphasised the
importance of distinguishing between ‘normal’ delegation of powers, mattersof technical detail, and ‘exceptional’ delegation of powers, which entailed thedelegation of power to make laws on matters of policy and principle. Withregard to the latter category, concern was expressed as to ‘whether parliamentwas surrendering its own function in the process’. Research conducted by JDHayhurst and P Wallington (1988) suggests that, while the volume ofstatutory instruments per session remains fairly stable, there has been achange in emphasis in the content of delegated legislation, an increasingvolume of which entail the ‘exceptional’ delegation of powers. Statutes arebecoming less detailed and granting broad enabling powers to delegates. TheEducation Reform Act 1988, Legal Aid Act 1988, Children Act 1989 and ChildSupport Act 1991 may all be cited in support of this proposition.
The Child Support Act 1991, which aims to ensure that absent parents,
rather than the state, make financial provision for their natural children, byway of example, grants to the Secretary of State the power to prescribe, inter
alia, those persons under a duty to disclose information, the purposes forwhich such disclosure shall be made and the mathematical formula to beemployed in making maintenance assessments. Section 51(1) of the Actconfers a further and more general power, namely that: Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
48837Report on Ministers’ Powers , Cmnd 4060, 1932, London: HMSO.

The Legislative Process
The Secretary of State may by regulations make such incidental,
supplementary and transitional provision as he considers appropriate inconnection with any provision made by or under this Act.
At committee stage in the House of Lords, the Child Support Bill was
criticised for its ‘skeletal’ nature and at second reading in the House ofCommons the volume of proposed delegated legislation, estimated to amountto over 100 regulations, was described as a ‘major flaw’ in the Bill.
38Given the
constitutional importance that delegated legislation be capable of beingscrutinised by the courts in order to ensure that it is intra vires, it is extremely
difficult to envisage a successful challenge being made in the courts againstsuch wide delegated powers as those granted under the Child Support Act1991.
Standing Orders provide that, from the 1996–97 session, one or more
standing committees are appointed for consideration of delegated legislation.Where a member gives notice of intention to pray for the annulment of astatutory instrument, or draft thereof, the instrument may be referred to thestanding committee.
39In addition, a Joint Select Committee of both Houses
scrutinises and reports if necessary on technical issues such as drafting orunexpected use of powers granted in the parent Act. If an instrument concernsfinance, these may be considered by the House of Commons Select Committeeon Statutory Instruments. The House of Lords’ Scrutiny Committee fordelegated legislation is discussed in Chapter 17. On delegated legislation andthe Human Rights Act 1998, see Chapter 19.
FINANCIAL PROCEDURES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Any evaluation of parliament’s role and the legislative process mustincorporate discussion of the extent to which, and means by which,parliament controls national finance, both in terms of taxation andexpenditure. In part, this topic requires consideration both under the headingof the legislative process and the scrutiny of the executive.
From a constitutional standpoint, the control over expenditure may be
viewed as control over the government of the day and its policies. As WEGladstone
40remarked, ‘expenditure flows from policy – to control
expenditure one must control policy’. Constitutionally, therefore, parliament’srole in relation to spending is but one part of its wider role of scrutinising andcalling the government to account. Hence, general debates, Question Time,and Select Committees are all germane to this matter.

Expenditure (supply)
Historically, the need to summon parliament arose from the financial needs of
the Crown.41The authority of the House of Commons sprang from, and is
based on, its power to approve both the raising of taxation and approveexpenditure. The governing maxim was, and remains, that ‘the Crowndemands, the Commons grant and the Lords assent to the grant of monies’.
42
Nowadays, for the ‘Crown’, must be inserted ‘Ministers of the Crown’.
Two propositions flow from this situation. First, that all charges – that is,proposals for the expenditure of monies – must be demanded by the Crownbefore they can be considered by parliament. The demand for approval ofmonies comes today from ministers, not backbenchers. Secondly, all chargesmust be considered by the House of Commons before they are approved. Theproposals for charges come before the House in the form of resolutions which,once approved, must be embodied in legislation originating in the House ofCommons but approved by both Houses.
43
National revenue to cover the cost of government is derived from three
main sources: taxation, borrowing and revenue from Crown lands. Allrevenue, of whatever kind, is credited to the Exchequer Account at the Bankof England in the form of the Consolidated Fund. All withdrawals must beauthorised by statute. Under the Consolidated Fund Acts, approximately one-third of expenditure is authorised in permanent form and does not requireannual parliamentary approval. Charges which are immune from thisscrutiny are those payments for service which it is deemed should not beconstantly drawn into the political arena for debate. For example, payment ofinterest on the national debt, salaries of judges of superior courts, the Speakerof the House of Commons, Leader of the Opposition, Comptroller andAuditor General, Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, paymentsto meet European Community and Union obligations and the Queen’s CivilList all fall under Consolidated Fund Services.
In contrast to Consolidated Fund Services are Supply Services. These cover
the bulk of annual public expenditure and cover the needs of all governmentdepartments and the cost of the armed forces. Provision for Supply Servicesrequire annual approval. The following requirements must be satisfied. Thegovernment must lay before the House of Commons each year its estimatesfor the forthcoming financial year, in the form of resolutions. Once approved,these are translated into Bills – the Consolidated Fund Bills and AppropriationBills. Money must be appropriated for specific purposes in the same session asthat in which it is required by the government: thus, monies voted for onefinancial year cannot be applied to a subsequent year.Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law

42 Erskine May,1997,  and see Standing Order No 46.
43 Subject to the Parliament Acts 1911–49.

The Legislative Process
The Voting of Supply is announced in the Queen’s Speech at the autumn
opening of the parliamentary session: ‘Members of the House of Commons,
estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you.’ The financial year forthe purposes of national expenditure runs from 1 April to 31 March.
The Chancellor’s Autumn Statement is made to parliament, preceded by
preparation of estimates by each government department for the forthcomingfinancial year, and the Budget announced in the Spring. The timing of theBudget is not, however, fixed and may be timetabled for Spring or Autumn. 
Estimates
There exist six classes of estimates. 
Ordinary annual estimates
Ordinary annual estimates are the principal estimates. They set out thespecific grants of money which will be required to fund the civil service,defence services, the cost of House of Commons administration and theNational Audit Office. Control over the form in which estimates are presentedis in the hands of the Treasury.
44Before any change in the form of the
estimates is made, approval must be obtained from the Treasury and CivilService Committee. 
Prior to estimates being settled, the Public Expenditure Survey Committee,
under the responsibility of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will havereported on anticipated needs of departments, and settled any disagreementsbetween departments. Its confidential report is sent to the Cabinet, whichformalises expenditure plans.
Votes on account
Votes on account are designed to cover the problem caused by the lapse intime between the end of one financial year and the enactment of legislationauthorising expenditure for the forthcoming year. A vote on accountauthorises up to 45 per cent of projected annual expenditure.
Supplementary estimates
Supplementary estimates may be presented to parliament for approval inrelation to increased sums needed for a particular service, or to meet a newsituation. 
Excess votes
Where a department has exceeded its budget, its administration andexpenditure will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General who
49144 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.

reports to the House. The Committee of Public Accounts will consider the
Comptroller’s report on the matter, which states its approval or objection tothe proposed excess vote. If the Public Accounts Committee approves theadditional expenditure, the matter is put to parliament without debate.
Votes of credit 
An emergency situation – or unexpected need for supply – may give rise to anapplication for a vote of credit. Situations of war will give rise to such votes.
45
Exceptional grants
An exceptional grant is one authorised by parliament for expenditure forsome particular objective, such as State funeral expenses or the erection ofmemorial statues.
Following parliamentary debate and approval, the Appropriation Bill will
be drafted authorising withdrawal from the Exchequer Fund. In mostparliamentary sessions, three regular Consolidated Fund and AppropriationBills (and, where necessary, extra Consolidated Fund Bills) are put toparliament for approval.
It will have been noticed that parliamentary approval for these financial
Bills is ‘without amendment or debate’. Thus far, it appears as if there is avirtual abandonment of parliament’s role in assenting to the ‘demands of theCrown’.
Limited time for the scrutiny of expenditure estimates is provided under
Standing Orders, which provide for three days per session to be allocated forthe consideration of estimates. The estimates to be considered are selected bythe Liaison Committee. The estimates selected for debate will generally bethose into which the select committee has inquired and reported.Amendments may be tabled, including the reduction in the estimates.
Aside from this limited opportunity, any control which parliament
exercises is through the control of policy and the normal parliamentarymechanisms for the scrutiny of government policy and administration.Griffith and Ryle sum up the supply procedure as follows:
The House has largely abandoned all opportunities for direct control of public
expenditure by means of debate and vote on the estimates presented to theHouse. Except on the three Estimates Days, there is no opportunity to amendor negative any of the individual estimates, and the government securesformal approval for its expenditure, without debate, in three or four blockvotes each year. In place of formal direct control by Voting Supply, which formany years has become theoretical, the House has increasingly relied oninformal indirect control through the exercise of its influence on policy,through scrutiny of policy, administration and expenditure by departmentallyChapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
49245 As occurred in both the First and Second World Wars.

The Legislative Process
related select committees and by ex post facto scrutiny of actual spending by the
Public Accounts Committee. [1989, p 251]
As the Public Accounts Committee Report to the House in 1987 admits,
‘Parliament’s consideration of annual estimates – the key constitutionalcontrol – remains largely a formality’.
46The Public Accounts Committee was
established in 1861, for the purpose of examining accounts of departmentsfollowing the submission of reports from the National Audit Office. The workof the Audit Office and the Committee and recent reforms are considered inChapter 16. 
Taxation (ways and means)
In relation to taxation – ways and means – the role of parliamentary scrutinyis rather different. The initiative in tax policies lies with the Treasury, underthe political direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
47
The starting point for the annual cycle is the Chancellor’s Budget in the
Spring or Autumn wherein, as Erskine May points out, ‘the Chancellordevelops his views of the resources of the country, communicates hiscalculations of probable income and expenditure and declares whether theburdens upon the people are to be increased or diminished’.
The Budget48
The Budget is the annual statement of tax proposals for the forthcoming year,together with the government’s expenditure plans for the following threeyears. At the end of the Budget speech, the ways and means resolutions aretabled. These resolutions form the basis for the main debate on the Budget,which lasts for between three and five days. The Finance Bill is thenintroduced and, within three to four weeks, will receive its second reading.The Bill then stands committed, in part, to a Committee of the Whole Houseand to a standing committee. The size of the standing committee forconsideration of the Finance Bill is larger than the normal composition, andwill have about 30 to 40 Members. Hundreds of amendments are generallyproposed to Finance Bills, although not all of these will be debated. 
Income tax rates are effective only until the end of the tax year and require
annual renewal under the Finance Act. The authority to collect taxes expireson 5 April each year. The Finance Act becomes law in July. In Bowles v Bank of
England (1913), the legality of taxation was considered. On 2 April 1912, the
House of Commons passed a resolution approving the income tax rate for theyear beginning 6 April 1912. The plaintiff had purchased stocks. The Bank

deducted income tax from dividends due on 1 July at the new tax rate before
the Consolidated Fund Act authorising the new rate had been passed byparliament. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the Bank was not entitled todeduct the tax until approved by parliament. Parker J stated that:
The question for decision is, does a resolution of the House of Commons
authorise the Crown to levy on the subject an income tax assented to by suchresolution but not yet imposed by Act of Parliament?
By the Statute of 1 William and Mary, usually known as the Bill of Rights, it
was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except underthe authority of Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights remains unrepealed andno practice or custom can be relied on by the Crown as justifying anyinfringement of its provisions.
It follows, therefore, that no resolution ... has any legal effect whatsoever ...
Such resolutions are necessitated by parliamentary procedure and adoptedwith a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition oftaxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown inlevying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.
Bowles v Bank of England led to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1913,49
which gives statutory authority to resolutions, as if imposed by Act of
Parliament. In Attorney General v Wilts United Dairies Ltd (1921), the Food
Controller had, under a regulation of 1919, established a pricing structure forthe issue of licences for milk purchase. The company claimed that the FoodController had no power to impose conditions of payment in granting licencesand that the condition amounted to a tax, which could not be imposedwithout clear and distinct legal authority. Lord Justice Atkin declared that:
... in view of the historic struggle of the Legislature to secure to itself the sole
power to levy money on its subjects, its complete success in that struggle, theelaborate means adopted by the representative House to control the amount,the conditions and purposes of the levy, the circumstances would beremarkable indeed which would induce the court to believe that theLegislature had sacrificed all the well known checks and precautions and notin express words but, by mere implication, had entrusted a Minister of theCrown with undefined and unlimited powers of imposing charges upon thesubject for purposes connected with his department.
The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 requires that the resolutions
passed be confirmed by the second reading of the Bill relating to the taxwithin 25 days of the House approving the resolution. It also provides thattheir statutory effect shall continue only until 5 August if passed in April orMarch, or for four months if passed at any other time. It is this, then, that setsthe deadline for the passage of the Finance Act.
Note that the Finance Act is not usually a Money Bill for the purposes of
the Parliament Act 1911, since it deals with wider matters than those listed insection 1(2) of the Act. Accordingly, unless certified by the Speaker to be aChapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Legislative Process
Money Bill, the Finance Bill will pass through the Lords in the usual manner.
By convention, however, in relation to a Finance Bill, the House of Lords hasrelinquished any effective role in relation to taxation or expenditure. 
SCRUTINY OF LEGISLATION BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS
Some Bills will start their life in the House of Lords and, once successfullypassed in the Lords, will pass to the Commons for debate and scrutiny. LawReform Bills, in particular, are regularly introduced in the House of Lords,under the aegis of the Lord Chancellor. The majority of Bills, however, starttheir parliamentary life in the Commons. Detailed consideration will be givento the House of Lords’ role in legislation in Chapter 17. Note, however, that,unless the Parliament Act procedure is used (which limits the role of theHouse of Lords in relation to legislation), Bills which have completed theirpassage in the Commons are passed to the House of Lords which employs,with some notable differences, the same legislative stages as the House ofCommons. The House of Lords may propose amendments to Bills, theacceptance or rejection of which will be a matter for negotiation between thetwo Houses.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
Receiving the royal assent represents the final stage in the enactment oflegislation. The royal assent is a prerogative act; for further discussion of this,see Chapter 6. The giving of the royal assent is not a matter which involves theMonarch personally. No monarch since 1854 has given the royal assent,although the power to do so still remains. When royal assent is required, theLord Chancellor submits a list of Bills ready for the Assent. In the House ofLords, attended by the Commons with the Speaker, the Clerk of theParliaments reads the title of the Bills for assent and pronounces the assent inNorman French. Once assent has been given, it is notified to each House ofParliament by the Speaker of the House.

PARLIAMENT AND EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITY LEGISLATION
The manner in which Community law is enacted and takes effect within theUnited Kingdom is considered in Chapters 8 and 9. Note here that someCommunity legislation becomes directly applicable within the UnitedKingdom without any enactment by parliament. Accordingly, it is of

particular importance that parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise both
proposals for Community legislation and legislation which has been enacted.
In addition to periodic debates on Europe, parliament sets aside time at
Question Time for European Community matters to be considered.Furthermore, ministers make regular statements to parliament concerningdecisions reached in the Council of Ministers. 
The House of Commons has established a Select Committee on European
Legislation. The House of Lords also has a Select Committee on the EuropeanCommunity. Both committees consider delegated legislation which is beingintroduced to give effect to Community law and also scrutinise legislativeproposals for future European Community law.
In addition to the select committees, the Commons has established two
standing committees for the consideration of European matters. The selectcommittee may refer such documentation to the standing committees as itthinks fit. The standing committees, comprising 13 Members, report to theHouse on matters referred to them.
Finally, successive governments have undertaken not to agree to
important European legislative proposals until these have been considered bythe committees. However, the effectiveness of these undertakings must be putin doubt by the increasing use of majority voting in the Council of Ministers,which makes it difficult for individual Member States to ‘block’ any proposedlegislation.Chapter 15: Constitutional and Administrative Law
496

CHAPTER 16
The concept of responsible government and the fundamental principle of
ministerial responsibility were considered in Chapter 11. The structure ofcentral government was considered in Chapter 10. In Chapter 14, thecomposition of the House of Commons was introduced. It will be recalled thatthe Commons comprises Her Majesty’s government, which is drawn from thepolitical party winning the largest number of seats at a general election,government backbenchers, Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition, comprising theLeader of the Opposition and Opposition spokesmen, who comprise theshadow Cabinet, and Opposition backbenchers, and Members of otherminority political parties. 
With the composition of the House of Commons in mind – and, to a lesser
extent, that of the House of Lords – and the functions which parliament isdesigned to fulfil, the issue which must now be addressed is the proceduresby which the House of Commons scrutinises government action in order thatan evaluation may be made as to the quality of that scrutiny. Consistent withthe doctrine of responsible government, the accountability of governmenttowards the democratic legislature is of fundamental importance in ensuringthat the government acts under the law and in accordance with the principlesof constitutionalism and democracy. In order to evaluate the role ofparliament in ensuring compliance with these constitutional doctrines, theprocedural mechanisms of the House must be examined. 
QUESTION TIME1
Question Time in the House of Commons is one of the most publicisedfeatures of parliament and represents one of the principal means by whichinformation is obtained from ministers by Members of Parliament and thepublic, and of underpinning individual ministerial responsibility. See Chapter11. 
Standing Orders provide that, from Monday to Thursday, the period from
2.35 pm to 3.30 pm is set aside for Question Time.
2On Mondays, Tuesdays
and Thursdays, ministers from several departments may answer Questions,

appearing on a rota, determined by the government,3which ensures that most
departments feature in Question Time at least once every three to four weeks. 
The Speaker calls the first Member listed on the Order of Business. The
minister then answers the question, and the Member is able to ask a
supplementary question. When that has been answered, the Speaker may thencall on other Members to ask their supplementary questions. The timeallocated to supplementary questions is within the Speaker’s discretion.Currently, about 15 to 20 questions are answered orally on each day. Theeffect of the supplementary is that a Member is able to pose a question forwhich no notice has been given.
Questions may be put to ministers for either oral or written answers.
Questions requiring written answers, which are to be printed in the OfficialJournal, are marked with a ‘W’. Those questions tabled for oral answer arerandomly ordered by the Table Office of the House and printed on the OrderPaper of the day. Between 100 and 150 questions may be put to a minister on asingle day. As a result, only a few will receive an oral reply. However, thosewhich do not receive an oral reply will receive a written reply published in theOfficial Report of the House. The number of questions which an individualMember of Parliament may have pending at any one time is eight during aperiod of ten sitting days, and not more than two on any one day, of whichnot more than one may be addressed to any one minister.
4Questions put
down for written answer – which may be for either a priority or non-priorityanswer – are less subject to restrictions and there is no limit on the number ofquestions which may be put down.
Prime Ministerial Question Time
Prime Minister’s Question Time has been moved from the conventional 15minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays, to Wednesdays, when the PrimeMinister answers questions for 30 minutes.
5It is felt that more meaningful
and in-depth scrutiny is facilitated by the reform. 
Questions put to the Prime Minister simply request that the Prime
Minister list his engagements for the day. Over 100 such questions mayappear on the Order Papers; on occasions, this number has risen to over 200.The purpose of this form of open question, which has been adopted since the1970s, is to avoid the possibility that the Prime Minister will simply refer thequestioner to the minister having responsibility for a particular matter. Theopen question also avoids the possibility – given the rules of notice forquestions – that a question put to the Prime Minister will be politically stale.The open question, therefore, provides a neutral peg on which to hang aChapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Scrutiny of the Executive
supplementary, and real, question. Only two supplementary questions per
Member are allowed. Supplementary questions may concern any matter forwhich the Prime Minister carries responsibility or matters which do not fallwithin any individual minister’s responsibility. For example, if a question isaddressed to the Prime Minister which should be addressed to the Secretaryof State for Social Security, the Prime Minister will decline to answer andsuggest that the matter be referred to the responsible minister. Generally,however, the issue raised will be one of general government policy in relationto matters such as the economy, unemployment, European or otherinternational affairs. The strength of Prime Ministerial Question Time lies inthe lack of notice given and the need for the Prime Minister to demonstrate hiscompetence across the full range of government policy. 
The Leader of the Opposition does not table questions for oral answer to
the Prime Minister. Instead, by convention, the Leader of the Opposition isgiven the opportunity to put one or more supplementary questions to thePrime Minister and, because of the open ended nature of the primaryquestion, it is possible for the Opposition Leader to raise virtually any aspectof government policy. For the observer, this is frequently parliament at itsbest, providing the opportunity – for Question Time is televised – to witnessthe leaders of the two main political parties in oral combat. As Griffith andRyle observe:
Here is experienced the direct confrontation of the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition in its most concentrated and highly charged form. Itis an opportunity no Leader of the Opposition can afford to neglect. It is alsothe occasion when the Prime Minister can be most critically tested, and variouscommentators or experienced observers have testified to how carefully thePrime Minister has to prepare for this ordeal. Success or failure on theseoccasions can greatly strengthen or seriously weaken the political standing ofthe two protagonists. [1989, pp 356–57]
A selection of questions put to the Prime Minister on 20 March 2001 included
the following matters:
• the level of strikes;• workers’ rights;
• the European Union;
• troops in Afghanistan;• the proposed ban on hunting;
• street crime;
• Gibraltar and sovereignty;• government support for sport;• the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth;
• House of Lords reform;
• funding and health care provision.

The role of the Speaker
The rules concerning questions have been developed over time by the Speaker
of the House, who is responsible for enforcing them. Only questions onmatters which are directly within a minister’s responsibility may be put and inaddition, by convention, there exists a range of issues which may not form thesubject of questions in the House. The following matters are not subject toQuestion Time:
(a) questions bringing the Sovereign directly before parliament, or questions
reflecting on the Sovereign;
(b) questions concerning issues on which the Prime Minister has given advice
to the Crown in relation to the royal prerogative: the grant of honours,
ecclesiastical patronage, appointment and dismissal of Privy Councillorsor the dissolution of parliament;
(c) questions not relating to the individual responsibility of the relevant
minister. Accordingly, questions relating to organisations under thecontrol of authorities other than parliament (for example, the StockExchange, trade unions and nationalised industries) are not permitted.
6
The following subjects are also excluded:
• local authorities and nationalised industries;
• personal powers of the Monarch;• internal affairs of other countries;• questions which have previously been put, or on which a minister has
previously refused to answer, or to which the answer is a matter of publicrecord;
• defence and national security;• Cabinet business, and advice given to ministers by civil servants;• questions seeking legal advice;• questions which raise issues so broad as to be incapable of reply within the
time constraints;
• trivial or irrelevant questions;• questions aiming to criticise judges;• questions on matters which are sub judice;
• questions posed in unparliamentary language.

The volume of parliamentary questions
The volume of questions put down for oral or written answer on averageamount to some 40,000 per parliamentary session. In 1998–99, 5,008 questionswere put down for oral answer and 32,149 were put down for a writtenanswer, giving a total of 37,157 questions. In the short 2000–01 session, 2,780Chapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

7 Erskine May,1997,  Chapter 17.

Scrutiny of the Executive
questions were put down for oral answer and 16,417 put down for written
answer. Figures such as these emphasise one of the most important functionsof Question Time: the accountability of government. A superficial observationof Question Time may prompt scepticism as to its value. The charge isfrequently made that Question Time is no more than a theatrical occasion,with ministers fully briefed by the Civil Service giving prepared answers toquestions posed within the rules as to notice and substance. Questions are notlimited to the Opposition parties and may, accordingly, come from thegovernment’s own supporters. This feature leads to the comment thatquestions are planted by government supporters in order to give a ministerthe opportunity to promote the government’s view or boast about itsachievements. To exaggerate such claims would be to miss a point of primeimportance about Question Time, that of the provision of information. Everyanswer given, oral or written, becomes a matter of public record, thusproviding a wealth of data about the workings of government.
Question Time is not a spontaneous affair, and it should not necessarily be
criticised for not being so. Members wishing to ask questions are required togive a minimum of three sitting days’ notice, and a maximum of ten days’notice. This time span for notice is designed to ensure both that there isadequate opportunity for ministers to prepare answers and that the issuebeing raised is still fresh and relevant.
Private notice questions
A private notice question8is an oral question put to a minister without the
need to observe the normal rules as to notice. Standing Orders define privatenotice questions as raising matters which are: ‘... in the Speaker’s opinion, ofan urgent character, and relate either to matters of public importance or to thearrangement of business.’ 
Private notice questions enable a matter of urgency to be raised for
immediate discussion in the period following Question Time. Because privatenotice questions take priority over other parliamentary business, rules providethat a Member who wishes to put such a question must give notice to theSpeaker before noon on the day he seeks to put the question, and the Speakerhas absolute discretion as to whether to allow or disallow the question to beput.
9Many applications for a private notice question are made, but few are
granted.
5018 See Erskine May,1997,  Chapter 16.
9 See Erskine May, 1997, p 296.

APPLICATIONS FOR EMERGENCY 
ADJOURNMENT DEBATES
Under Standing Orders,10any Member of Parliament may apply to the
Speaker to raise an urgent matter for debate.11If granted, the matter will be
raised immediately after Question Time and private notice questions, if any.
At that time, the matter is briefly introduced and a substantive three hourdebate will be arranged for the following day. Because emergency debatesdisrupt the parliamentary timetable, they are confined to matters deemed tobe of urgent national importance, and applications are sparingly granted(normally only one or two per session). In the 1991–93 session, there were 19unsuccessful applications for an emergency debate and one successfulapplication,
12whereas in 1998–99, there were a mere three unsuccessful
applications, and in 2000–01 only seven.
DAILY ADJOURNMENT DEBATES
At the close of the parliamentary day, under Standing Orders, the opportunityis provided for backbenchers to initiate a short debate on a matter of theirchoosing. Competition for a debate is keen and Members take part in a ballotheld in the Speaker’s Office for the opportunity. If successful, the Membermay speak for 15 minutes on the chosen subject and the relevant minister isgiven 15 minutes for reply. The subject matter for debate is as varied as areMembers’ interests. The matter raised may be one of relevance solely to theMember’s constituency or the matter may be related to a particular source ofgeneral concern. 
EARLY DAY MOTIONS
Behind this curious colloquial term, lies one of the least well known orevaluated parliamentary processes. An Early Day Motion (EDM) is a writtenmotion tabled in parliament requesting a debate ‘at an early day’. AnyMember of Parliament may table an EDM, on any subject matter, subject to afew procedural rules.
13
EDMs originated in the mid-nineteenth century. Before that time, the
parliamentary timetable was relaxed and Members had adequate opportunityto raise matters for subsequent debate in the House. As pressure for time inthe House increased, the practice developed of Members giving notice thatthey intended to raise a particular matter for debate at some future,Chapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law
50210 Dating from 1967. 
11 See Erskine May, 1997, Chapter 16(3).

Scrutiny of the Executive
unspecified, date. These notices were formally recorded from 1865 in the daily
papers of the House and today appear on the Motions Notice Paper, whichforms part of the daily ‘Vote Bundle’ – the working papers of the House.
The purpose of tabling an EDM is not only to express a view and request a
debate, but also to test the strength of feeling in the House over the matterinvolved. An EDM may be tabled by one Member or by several, and otherMembers may add their names in support. Some EDMs are tabled by theLeader of the Opposition: for example, EDM No 351 of 1978–79, supported byfive other senior Conservative Members led to a debate on 28 March 1979,which resulted in the resignation of the government and the subsequentgeneral election. The Opposition may also table motions giving notice of aprayer to annul a statutory instrument; see Chapter 15.
Many EDMs are tabled by Members of all parties on a particular issue.
These ‘all-party’ EDMs are increasing, as is the volume of EDMs generally,and provide an important outlet for the expression of views across party lines. 
Once tabled, an EDM remains current for the duration of the
parliamentary session and may or may not attract considerable supportwithin the House. Between 1948–49 and 1990–91, 29 EDMs have attracted over300 signatures.
The rules and restrictions on EDMs are few, and are consistent with the
general rules concerning motions. Thus, the motion must be worded inparliamentary language, must not relate to a matter which is sub judice and is
limited to 250 words. Within these limits, a Member may table an EDM onany subject. 
The volume of EDMs tabled per parliamentary session reveals their
increasing popularity as a means of expression of, primarily, backbenchopinion.

In terms of the number of debates which flow from EDMs, their success rate
must be regarded as low. The EDM censuring the government tabled by theRt Hon Mrs Thatcher in 1979 is a rarity, both in terms of securing a debate andin the dramatic effect of signalling the fall of a government.

Tebbit and Michael Heseltine, tabled a motion calling for the abolition of the
Inner London Education Authority: a matter which was contrary to the thenpolicy of the Secretary of State for Education, Kenneth Baker. The EDM wassupported by 120 other Conservative backbenchers and caused the Secretaryof State to amend the Bill.
14
Notwithstanding such rare examples of EDMs having important political
and legal effects, the overall significance of the EDM should not beunderestimated. Depending on the volume of support a particular EDMattracts, it represents an expression of the mood of the House across a wholespectrum of issues which places pressure on the government to respond. Forexample, the all-party ‘Parliament First’ group of MPs in 2001 put down anEDM calling for the strengthening of parliament in terms of scrutiny of theexecutive. Over 150 MPs put their names to it. The dramatic rise in thenumber of EDMs per session since the early 1980s to the current day attests totheir popularity as a vehicle for the expression of views and concerns. TheEDM has been described as the ‘graffiti board’ of parliament, signalling togovernment the issues and concerns of Members. Where the rules of theHouse prevent a Member from expressing a view in Debate, perhaps becausehe cannot catch the Speaker’s eye, or by means of a question, perhaps becauseof ministerial responsibility or because the subject matter falls within one ofthe excluded categories, the EDM may represent the only vehicle forexpression.
SELECT COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Select committees in the House of Commons are of some antiquity, althoughthe current structure of committees dates back only to 1979. Select committeestake several forms. Domestic committees include Accommodation and Works,Administration, Catering and Information. Administration committeesinclude Broadcasting, Standards and Privileges, Procedure, Selection,Standing Orders and the Modernisation Committee. There are alsocommittees to deal with the scrutiny of proposed legislation, including theDeregulation Committee, European Legislation Committee, StatutoryInstruments (Joint Committee and Consolidation of Bills (Joint Committee). Inaddition there is the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which considershuman rights issues and proposals for remedial orders made under theHuman Rights Act 1998. The majority of these committees are establishedunder Standing Orders of the House.
The current system of departmentally-related select committees was
established in 1979 as a result of dissatisfaction with the then currentarrangements for the monitoring of government departments.

Scrutiny of the Executive
the Select Committee on Procedure16recommended that 12 new committees
be established, seeing their role as being one of enabling the House as a whole
to exercise effective control and stewardship over ministers and theexpanding bureaucracy of the modern state for which they are answerable.
17
Following debate in the House,18the proposals were approved and
implemented. In debate, the Leader of the House,19described the proposals as:
... a necessary preliminary to the more effective scrutiny of government ... and
opportunity for closer examination of departmental policy ... an importantcontribution to greater openness in government, of a kind that is in accordwith our parliamentary arrangements and our constitutional tradition.
Functions of select committees
The functions of departmentally-related committees are defined as being:
(a) to send for persons, papers and records, to sit notwithstanding any
adjournments of the House, to adjourn from place to place and to report
from time to time;
(b) to appoint specialist advisers, either to supply information which is not
readily available or to elucidate matters of complexity within thecommittee’s order of reference;
(c) to report from time to time the minutes of evidence taken before sub-
committees; and
(d) to report to the House their opinion and observations upon any matters
referred to them for their consideration, together with minutes of evidencetaken before them, and also to make a special report of any matters whichthey may think fit to bring to the notice of the House.
The scope of power granted to select committees is very broad. It is for thecommittee to determine, within the confines of the work of the department,what subject matter to examine and to determine what evidence thecommittee needs to assist in its examination. To facilitate the working of selectcommittees, each has a permanent staff of some three to four, and somecommittees have the power, under Standing Orders, to establish sub-committees.

The Liaison Committee
The task of co-ordinating the work of select committees falls to the Liaison
Committee, first established in 1967, the membership of which comprises allthe Chairmen of the departmentally-related select committees, and theChairmen of the Public Accounts Committee and the European LegislationSelect Committee. Its role is defined as being:Chapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Scrutiny of the Executive
(a) to consider general matters relating to the work of select committees; and
(b) to give such advice relating to the work of select committees as may be
sought by the House of Commons Commission.20
Membership of select committees
Membership of select committees, unlike that of standing committees,21lasts
for the life of a parliament, thus providing stability of membership22and the
opportunity for Members to develop a degree of expertise in the subject matter.
Membership is largely limited, by convention, to backbenchers. The onlyministers who are members are the Leader of the House,
23the government
Deputy Chief Whip24and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.25Opposition
front-bench spokesmen are not appointed to select committees.
Competition for membership of select committees is keen, particularly for
the high profile committees. The political party whips have great influence, ifnot total control, over membership. The Committee of Selection, itself a selectcommittee, is made up of senior Members of the House drawn from allpolitical parties. The party whips make nominations to the committee which inturn reports to the House for approval. The strength of each political partyoverall in the House is reflected, largely but not totally accurately, in themembership of select committees, thus giving to the committee an legitimacyapproximate to that of the House as a whole. In July 2000, the LiaisonCommittee recommended that control over membership of select committeesby the whips should be ended and appointments be placed in the hands of apanel of Members of Parliament. The government rejected the proposal.
Committee chairmanship
It might reasonably be assumed that the chairmanship of the committees alwaysfell to Members of the government’s own party, but this is not the case, andselect committees may be chaired by a Member of any political party. Thedecision as to which party should chair a particular committee is a matter fornegotiation between government and Opposition. Once that decision has beenreached, it is for the committee members, under the ‘advice’ of the whips,formally to elect the chairman.
The significance of the sharing of chairs between government and
opposition parties lies in the attempt to minimise party political conflict, in
order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the scrutiny to be broughtto bear on government departments. Once appointed, the chairman acts with

complete impartiality. Select committees are designed to operate on the basis
of broad consensus as to aims and objectives, and to produce a singleauthoritative report to parliament as a whole. It is not usual for the committeeto vote on party lines although, in highly controversial matters, this mayoccasionally be inevitable. If the committee intends to be critical of thegovernment in its report, it is necessary for at least one Member of thegovernment party to agree with the criticism(s). 
The work of select committees illustrated
The inquiries undertaken by select committees are both broad ranging and indepth. It is entirely a matter for the committee to determine what subject toinvestigate and, accordingly, every aspect of government administration ispotentially susceptible to inquiry. In the past, for example, select committeeshave inquired into the conduct of the Falklands War
26and the banning of
trade union membership at the Government’s Communication Headquarters(GCHQ).
27The committees have investigated such matters as the Westland
Helicopter affair; arms to Iraq; salmonella in eggs; and the loss of the Maxwellpension funds, on which, see, further, below. The wide ranging nature ofinquiries undertaken is illustrated in the subject matter chosen by just two ofthe committees in the 1998–99 session:

Scrutiny of the Executive
The co-operation of government
It has been seen above that committees have the power to send for ‘persons
and papers’. The work of select committees would be much impaired if thecommittee was obstructed in its attempt to gain access to evidence. The SelectCommittee on Procedure had suggested, inter alia, that there should be power
to compel ministers to attend and to give evidence. That recommendation wasrejected by the government, on the basis that select committees should nothave power to issue orders to ministers – such a power lay with the Housealone. Accordingly, there is no formal requirement that the government co-operate with select committees. However, the Leader of the House hasundertaken that:
... every Minister, from the most senior Cabinet Minister to the most junior
Under Secretary, will do all in his or her power to co-operate with the newsystem of committees and to make it a success.
30
For the most part, governments do co-operate with the committees, but limits
to this co-operation can be perceived through an examination of fourinstances. 
The Westland affair
In the aftermath of the Westland Helicopter affair, during which both theSecretary of State for Defence, Michael Heseltine, and the Secretary of State forTrade and Industry, Leon Brittan, resigned,
31three select committees inquired
into the matter.32When the Select Committee on Defence announced its
intention to inquire into the matter, the government refused to allowwitnesses from the Department of Trade and Industry, in particular theDirector of Information, to whom a leak of the Solicitor General’s letter hadbeen attributed, to give evidence to the committee. The government’sjustification for this refusal was that the giving of evidence by a senior civilservant to a parliamentary committee would have major implications for theconduct of government and for relations between ministers and their civilservants. This refusal had two implications. First, it meant that parliament wasunable to check the accuracy of statements made by the Prime Minister in theHouse, or those made by Leon Brittan in relation to the leaked letter. Thesecond implication was that the civil servants concerned were neither able toexplain nor to defend their actions.

Salmonella in eggs
In 1988, a junior Health Minister, Edwina Currie, resigned office, subsequent
to public comments made about alleged contamination of eggs. Her remarksthat ‘most eggs produced in the country’ were infected with salmonella hadan immediate impact on the sale and consumption of eggs, causing financialdamage to egg producers. The Select Committee on Agriculture invited MrsCurrie to give evidence to the committee, but Mrs Currie declined. Followingan exchange of letters which involved the select committee chairman insistingthat it was for the committee, and not Mrs Currie, to decide whether or notshe should give evidence, Mrs Currie grudgingly agreed to appear. In theevent, her evidence proved, as she had indicated that it would, unhelpful.
The Maxwell pension fund
During the 1991–92 session, the Social Services Select Committee wasenquiring into the mismanagement of pension funds by the MirrorNewspaper Group’s recently deceased Chairman, Mr Robert Maxwell. MrMaxwell’s sons, both holding prominent positions in the Group before theirfather’s death, and subsequently assuming control of the companies, weresummoned to give evidence. The Maxwells refused, relying on a claimed rightto silence in the light of imminent criminal charges and the risk of jeopardisingtheir own fair trial. The committee chairman wanted the Maxwells to becharged with contempt of parliament (see Chapter 18), but no action wastaken.
Arms to Iraq
In February 1992, the Select Committee on Trade and Industry examined thesale of equipment to Iraq during the conflict in the Gulf.
33The equipment
involved was piping which allegedly could be used to manufacture a missilelauncher – a ‘supergun’. That inquiry was frustrated by the alleged refusal ofthe Attorney General and others to give details of the information known tothe Department of Trade and Industry when the export licence was granted.Subsequently, three directors of the company Matrix Churchill wereprosecuted by Customs and Excise for breach of the restrictions on the exportof military equipment contrary to the Import, Exports and Customs Powers(Defence) Act 1939 by obtaining export licences by deception. The prosecutionwas halted when Alan Clark
34revealed in court that there had been no
deception, since the government was fully aware of the exports and theirintended usage. The trial collapsed and prompted a judicial inquiry headedby Sir Richard Scott. The affair has involved allegations of a cover up on thepart of the government and has given rise to serious questions concerning theChapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

role and use of public interest immunity certificates, by the use of which,
information may be withheld from the courts ‘in the public interest’.35
The power of select committees to compel witnesses to give
evidence
The extent to which ministers and civil servants can be made to give evidence
detracts from the effectiveness of select committee inquiries and from effectiveparliamentary scrutiny of the administration of government. The SelectCommittee on Procedure had examined its powers to call for ‘persons andpapers’ in 1977–78.
36The committee accepted that Members of the House
Commons could be invited, but not compelled, to attend. Compulsoryattendance could only be effected by an Order of the House.
37In light of the
limitations, the committee recommended that their powers be increased toinclude the right to order the attendance of ministers to give evidence, and toorder the production of papers and records by all ministers, includingSecretaries of State.
38Were the minister not to co-operate, the committee
proposed that it should make a special report to the House and to table amotion for an address for parliamentary debate on the minister’s conduct. Therecommendation was not, however, implemented. 
Reform of parliamentary evidence rules
The problem of witnesses who attend but who give evidence which is eitheruntruthful or which paints only half the picture – a problem faced byparliament in its committee inquiries into the Arms to Iraq affair, about whichSir Richard Scott was particularly critical – was considered in Chapter 10. In afurther attempt to strengthen parliament’s powers over its Members, andwitnesses giving evidence to its committees, since January 1997, new ruleshave applied. Persons giving evidence are now required to take a formal oath.Anyone found to have lied to parliament may be reported to the CrownProsecution Service with a view to prosecution for perjury, which, in the eventof conviction, could lead to a maximum prison sentence of seven years. Wherethe person is a Member of Parliament, the committee will ask the Commons tovote to remove the Member’s immunity from prosecution.
The move was in part presaged by the David Willett’s affair, in which the
former Paymaster General was accused by the Committee on Standards andPrivileges of having ‘dissembled’ in his evidence over whether he had tried to

influence a parliamentary inquiry into the cash for questions affair.39As
discussed in Chapter 18, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privileges
recommended in 1999 that a new Parliamentary Privileges Act be introducedand that the failure to answer questions or produce necessary evidence tocommittees should be made a criminal offence.
Select committee reports
At the conclusion of a select committee inquiry, a report will be drawn up.The committee aims to produce an authoritative, unanimous report which ispresented to parliament. The degree of consensus over a particular issuewithin the committee membership will dictate the extent to which unanimitycan be achieved. Griffith and Ryle comment that ‘the committees havemanaged to achieve a high degree of unanimity in their finding andrecommendations’ (1989, pp 520–21). This ‘high degree’ is recognised byGriffith and Ryle to be one achieved where the matter is not politicallycontroversial between the parties, and that the need for unanimity may resultin committees avoiding ‘some of the big issues of the day’. Two illustrationsare offered by Griffith and Ryle. The first relates to the Foreign AffairsCommittee investigation
40into the sinking of the General Belgrano during the
Falklands War in May 1982.41In the inquiry, the membership of the
committee had divided cleanly along party lines and the end result was a‘dissenting’ report by four Opposition Members. On the other hand, theDefence Committee investigation into the Westland affair, despite politicaldisagreement during the investigation, nonetheless resulted in a unanimousreport.
Approximately one-third of all reports published will be debated on the
floor of the House. This fact is one which also gives rise to criticism of selectcommittee effectiveness, although it must be conceded that the time given fordebate on reports has increased in recent years. Parliamentary procedure doesnot make specific provision for debate on reports. The Procedure Committeehas suggested that eight days per session should be devoted to such debatesbut this proposal has not been acted upon. Sufficient, but not too much,weight should be attached to this alleged defect, and four arguments may beadvanced which limit its impact. The first relates to the commitmentundertaken by successive governments to respond to select committeereports. Such an undertaking does not, of itself, ensure that therecommendations of the committee will be implemented but it does ensurethat the government will react to any criticisms made and proposals putChapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Scrutiny of the Executive
forward. Members of the committee and other interested Members of
Parliament, particularly the Opposition, will be slow to let an opportunity tocriticise government pass. The second argument centres on the informationgained through the process of the inquiry. It has been seen that ministers maydecline or refuse to answer questions fully, and that they can restrict theextent to which civil servants may give evidence. Where a minister refuses toco-operate with a select committee he will inevitably find media attentionfocused upon him and some cogent justification for his reticence will have tobe forthcoming. For the most part, evidence suggests that there is a highdegree of ministerial co-operation with committees; this need not be seen asbeing necessarily willing participation but, rather, a matter of politicalprudence. 
Thirdly, it must be recognised that the reports emanating from select
committee inquiries are matters of public record, available both to Members ofParliament and to the interested press and public. The information gatheredin the course of an inquiry becomes public information, information which,before the introduction of the new committee structure, was often hiddenfrom the public gaze. Finally, the absence of debate on the floor of the Housein many cases will be justified by the pressure on the parliamentary timetable.It may well be the case that debate on all reports is desirable in principle, but,since 1979, over 900 reports have been published by select committees, ofvarying significance and on a plethora of matters. On many matters, openingdebate to all Members of the House may involve a duplication of effort, withnon-specialist Members of Parliament inexpertly attempting to re-analyse theinformation examined by the more specialised select committee Members. 
Evaluation
An evaluation of the work of select committees in relation to thefundamentally important question concerning the accountability ofgovernment must be approached with caution. The outcome of an appraisal isinevitably related to the expectations which the appraiser holds and, as aconsequence, the evaluation of one commentator may not be the same asanother’s. Caution is also urged against the making of sweepinggeneralisations as to the effectiveness of select committees which are diversein nature and operation. Many factors are involved in the analysis: the extentto which media, and hence public, attention is focused on a particular enquiry;the sensitivity of the subject matter; the degree of political consensus withinthe committee; the extent to which governments are prepared to make time onthe floor of the House to debate select committee reports; the extent to whichselect committee inquiries result in improved efficiency in government; andthe extent to which government and other witnesses co-operate with thecommittees in the provision of information. All of these factors, and more,must be put in the balance before any reasoned conclusions can be reached.
513

Griffith and Ryle state that:
If we compare these committees with their predecessors, there is little doubt
that the new committees present a more formidable critical presence toMinisters and departments. [1989, p 520]
Philip Norton comments that:
Committees are thus able to ensure that Ministers and civil servants aresubjected to scrutiny in a public authoritative forum, eking out explanationsand data that otherwise may not be forthcoming. In so doing, they haveensured ... a greater transparency of departments, ensuring that their actionsare more visible to Parliament and to the public and outside groups. Throughissuing reports and recommendations, they also serve to have some impact ondepartmental thinking. [1993, p 100]
At the heart of any evaluation must lie the recognition of the inherent tension
– already stressed in Chapter 15 in relation to the scrutiny of legislation –between the legitimate right of the government to govern and the equallylegitimate right of parliament as a whole to ensure the collectiveaccountability of government and the individual responsibility of ministers. 
SCRUTINY OF NATIONAL FINANCE
In Chapter 15, the means by which the House of Commons scrutinisesproposals for taxation and expenditure was examined. In this section, themanner in which parliament scrutinises the manner in which public moneyhas been spent is discussed. The responsibility for, and control over,expenditure lies with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The manner in whichparliament scrutinises public expenditure is through the Public AccountsSelect Committee which examines reports of audits conducted by theComptroller and Auditor General, who is head of the National Audit Office.
42
The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) 
The committee was first established in 1861. The committee has the power toexamine the accounts ‘showing the appropriation of the sums granted byparliament to meet the public expenditure, and of such other accounts laidbefore parliament, as the committee may think fit’.
43The committee consists
of not more than 15 Members, of whom four represents a quorum. While thecomposition of the committee represents (as does that of all select committees)the party-political strength of the House, the PAC functions in a non-partisanmanner. By convention, the PAC’s Chairman is a Member of the Opposition.The committee has the power to ‘send for persons, papers and records’ and toChapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

report from time to time.44The PAC issues approximately 30 to 40 reports per
session.45
The principal function of the committee is to ensure that money is spent
for the purposes intended by parliament, and that money is spent effectively
and economically. The committee holds many meetings in public. One dayper session is set aside for debate of its reports. By critically examining theexpenditure of departments and assessing the extent to which expenditureproduces value for money, the PAC exerts considerable influence ongovernment. 
The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) 
The CAG is an officer of the House of Commons, appointed by the Crown,and can be removed from office for misbehaviour only on the successfulmoving of an address to both Houses of Parliament. As head of the NationalAudit Office, the CAG’s function is to examine the economy, efficiency andeffectiveness with which bodies have used their resources in the pursuit ofpolicy.
46The CAG appoints his own staff, who are not civil servants. The
reports of the National Audit Office47are recorded in the Weekly Information
Bulletin of the House of Commons and are available to the public. 
The CAG audits and certifies the accounts of over 450 departments and
bodies. Three significant areas of administration lie outside his jurisdiction:nationalised industries, local authorities and private bodies. 
During the 1992–93 parliamentary session, the National Audit Office and
the Northern Ireland Audit Office published 67 reports, of which 21 formedthe basis of Public Accounts Committee reports in that session. Matters onwhich the Public Accounts Committee reported in that session included thesale of regional electricity companies, National Power, PowerGen andGirobank plc; health service facilities for physically disabled persons; theadministration of legal aid in England and Wales, coastal defences in England;overseas aid; and water and the environment. 
The independence of the CAG from government, backed by the non-
partisan Public Accounts Committee, provides powerful watchdog over theadministration of government and the expenditure of public money. It must,however, be conceded that where serious overspending or the misuse ofpublic monies has already taken place, the scrutiny and report can only bemade ex post facto.

The Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000
Modernisation of the system of controlling the management of public finance
was effected with the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000.48In
brief, the Act provides for resource accounting and resources budgeting andintroduces a system whereby there are consolidated accounts for the whole ofthe public sector (Whole of Government Accounts). The Act also provides forthe Treasury to establish Partnerships UK, a private sector body responsiblefor the Private Finance Initiative, the system designed to facilitate the injectionof private money into government expenditure programmes. 
The Act sets out the criteria for the examination of accounts by the
Comptroller and Auditor General, who must be satisfied that:
(a) the accounts present a true and fair view;(b) any money provided has been expended for the purposes intended by
parliament;
(c) any resources authorised by parliament have been used for the purposes
so authorised; and
(d) the department’s financial transactions are in accordance with any
relevant authority.Chapter 16: Constitutional and Administrative Law

CHAPTER 17
INTRODUCTION
The majority of liberal democracies have bicameral legislatures, or legislatures
with two ‘chambers’ or ‘houses’.1In the United Kingdom, the second
chamber, the Upper House – or House of Lords – is currently an unelectedchamber which has judicial, legislative, scrutinising and debating functions.
2
The justifications for, and advantages of, a second chamber, irrespective of themerits of the actual second chamber, are twofold. First, a second chamberprovides a forum for reflection, and for ‘second thoughts’ on policies andlegislative proposals. A second chamber provides for a diffusion rather than
concentration of power within parliament. Secondly, depending on the
allocation of power between the two chambers, the Upper House plays avaluable role in the revision of legislation which has passed through theLower House. Such revision is of particular significance where the LowerHouse is dominated by a government with a strong majority and also when –irrespective of the political make up of the Lower House – procedures forcurtailing debate have been employed (see Chapter 15). The scrutiny, andamendment, of Bills is equally important in improving the quality of thestatute book. As will be seen below, the House of Lords plays a major role instatute revision. On occasion, such revision is contrary to the wish of theCommons, which may choose to acquiesce in the Lords’ amendments ratherthan employ the Parliament Act procedure which regulates the respectivepowers of the two Houses of Parliament. On other occasions, however, therevision undertaken in the Lords is either at the instance of the governmentitself, which may choose to introduce amendments to Bills in the Lords, or byMembers of the House of Lords in order to improve the drafting of the Act. 
Until 1999, when the first stage of a major reform to the composition of the
House of Lords was implemented, the House of Lords was unique amongsecond legislative chambers. A majority of parliamentary democracies haveelected second chambers, or a second chamber which is part elected and partnominated. By contrast, until 1999, the House of Lords was comprised of amajority of unelected hereditary members and a minority of nominatedmembers. In 1999, the right of most hereditary peers to sit and vote in theLords was abolished, leaving the Lords with a majority of nominated and nodemocratically elected members. Only Canada and Ireland have a

predominantly nominated second chamber. Before the 1997 general election,
the Labour Party had pledged to reform the House of Lords, regarding therole of the unelected House as incompatible with modern democracy. Ratherthan introduce wholesale reform immediately, however, the governmentdecided on a two stage reform. The first, which is largely but not whollyaccomplished, was to remove the right of the hereditaries to participate inparliament. The second, which remains for the future, was to decide preciselywhat form of composition was needed – whether fully elected or partlyelected and partly nominated – and the powers which the reformed secondchamber should have. In order to reach this decision, the governmentestablished a Royal Commission, chaired by Lord Wakeham, to consider theissue and make recommendations. While this second stage of reform wasexpected to be implemented during the Labour government’s first parliament,it was decided to postpone the second stage. Details of the reforms, achievedand proposed, are discussed below.
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW3
The origins of the House of Lords lie in the councils summoned by EnglishKings in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in order to give advice,decide on appeal cases and, under certain circumstances, to make financialgrants to the King. These ‘King’s Councils’ had developed into a form whichis recognisable today by 1295, then being an assembly of the ‘three estates ofthe realm’, the clergy, barons and commons – ‘those who pray, those whofight, those who work’. From the earliest times, both spiritual and secularhereditary peers formed the membership of the House of Lords, by whichname it became known in the sixteenth century. Maitland (1908) asserts thatthe separation into two Houses occurred around the middle of the fourteenthcentury, although Stubbs (1880) contends that the two bodies were separatefrom the earliest time. The functions of the two Houses also differed: it was forthe Lords to advise the King, and it was for the Commons to consent to theKing’s proposals. By 1330, parliament was to meet annually,
4at least once but
more times as summonsed. Nevertheless, as seen in Chapter 6, the sitting ofparliament was a matter for the King to determine and, between 1364 and1689, there were many years in which no parliament met, the longest periodbeing 11 years, during which time Charles I ruled under the prerogative.
The House of Lords, until 1999, comprised a majority of hereditary non-
spiritual (secular or temporal) peers,
5along with life peers (nominated
members) and 26 Archbishops and Bishops. Before the seventeenth century,Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Wales (from 1302), Dukes (from 1337), Marquesses (from 1385), Earls, Viscounts and
Barons. Other members of the Royal Family entitled to sit are the Duke of Edinburgh,Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Kent and Duke of York.

The House of Lords
the power of the Lords Spiritual was great. In the 1453–54 parliamentary
session, to take but one typical example of historical membership, themembership of the House of Lords was two Archbishops, 18 Bishops, 27abbots and priors, five dukes, 11 earls, three viscounts and 44 barons: a total of111. With the suppression of the monasteries, spiritual peers were excludedfrom parliament and, from this time, the Upper House became apredominantly secular body. The growth in the number of secular, ortemporal, peers stems from the reign of James I (1603–25), with 96 sitting inhis last parliament. By 1685, in the reign of James II, the number had increasedto 145. The Lords Spiritual were totally excluded from parliament between1642 and 1661.
An early conflict between the House of Commons and House of Lords and
the King occurred in 1649, when by a vote of the Commons it was declaredthat neither the consent of the House of Lords, nor that of the King, wasnecessary to enact valid law:
The commons of England in Parliament assembled do declare that the People
are under God the original of all just power, and that whatsoever is enacted ordeclared for law by the commons in Parliament assembled, hath the force oflaw ... although the consent and concurrence of the King or the House of Peersbe not had thereunto.
In March 1649, the Commons – under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell –
abolished both the Monarchy and the House of Lords – an Act which wasregarded as of no effect once the Restoration of the Monarchy took place in1660. In 1661, Bishops were restored to the House of Lords.
6The Acts of
Union, with Scotland in 1707, and Ireland in 1800, provided for Scottish andIrish representation in the House of Lords.

THE COMPOSITION OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
The House of Lords – almost uniquely amongst democratic legislatures – isunelected. While this situation is anomalous, undemocratic and anachronisticin an otherwise democratic society, there are some advantages in thearrangement which are too often overlooked. In essence, the theoretical valueof an unelected chamber paradoxically lies in its lack of accountability toeither the government of the day or the electorate, giving it an independencewithout which the value of its work would be diminished. However, whethersuch advantages actually flow from the House of Lords can only be evaluatedthrough examining the impact which the House has, in its revising role, ongovernment legislation. Prior to the removal of the majority of hereditary

7 Numbering 16 and 28, respectively. Scottish peers continue to sit in the House; Irish
peers continued to sit in the House of Lords after 1922 (see Chapter 3), but were not
replaced on their deaths. The last Irish peer entitled to sit in the Lords died in 1961. SeeLysaght, 1967.

peers from the House, they represented a majority of peers and, being
dominated by Conservative Members, had the ability to act in a party politicalpreferential manner – both to support a Conservative government’slegislation and to frustrate that of a Labour government. It was perceptionssuch as this which caused, in part, the current Labour government to actswiftly to remove the hereditary element as a first stage of reform. In theevent, some 92 hereditary peers remained in the Lords, and will so remainuntil the second stage of reform takes place. Historically, there has also been apolitical imbalance in the allegiance of life peers, with the Conservative peersoutnumbering Labour peers. This imbalance is also being redressed, with thegovernment increasing the number of appointed Labour life peers. However,the uncompleted reform has led to the criticism that the government holds,through its selection of appointees, excessive powers of patronage, capable ofundermining the independence of the Lords. A further factor in thecomposition of the House, which renders evaluation of its work morecomplex, is the considerable proportion of independent peers, or ‘crossbenchers’, who owe no political allegiance to any party.
The House of Lords also has, under the Parliament Act 1911, the power to
block any Bill attempting to extend the life of a parliament.
8This may be seen
as no more than a constitutional ‘backstop’ against a potential abuse of powerby government, and the life of a parliament has indeed been extended inrecent history in times of national emergency.
9Such extensions, however,
have been with the consent of the Lords. Any attempt by a government tosuspend elections in order to protect its own political power would be blockedby the Lords without whose consent such a Bill could not become law. On theother hand, any advantages which flow from the current composition of theLords must be weighed in the balance against the demands of democracy.While an unelected second chamber having no role in the passage oflegislation might be acceptable to some, an unelected second chamber withreal – although ultimately limited – legislative power represents an affront tothe idea of democratic government. It is for this reason that the issue of reformof the House of Lords has been for so long on the political agenda.

Hereditary peers
Hereditary peers are created under the prerogative of the Crown on theadvice on the Prime Minister. A peerage is created either by a Writ ofSummons to the House or, more recently, under Letters Patent from theSovereign which will define the line of succession, which invariably falls tothe male heirs. A peerage created by a Writ of Summons will devolve to allChapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

heirs, thus enabling female successors to the title. Disputes concerning
succession to a title are resolved by the House of Lords, through theCommittee for Privileges. The evidence of blood tests is admissible inevidence.
11A peerage cannot be surrendered other than under the disclaimer
for life under the Peerage Act 1963,12on which, see below. The disclaimer
does not prevent the conferment of a life peerage: see below.
In January 1998, there were 759 hereditary peers, out of a total
membership of 1,272, comprising just under 60 per cent of the total.13All this
changed, however, in 1999. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, the rights ofmost hereditary peers were removed. While it had been intended to removethe rights of all hereditary peers to sit and vote, threats of opposition to theHouse of Lords Bill from the majority of Conservative hereditary peerspersuaded the government to allow 92 peers to remain. In the deal brokeredby Viscount Cranborne, the then Conservative Leader in the Lords, theremaining hereditaries would be elected by the hereditary peers themselves.A further seven former hereditary peers were returned to the House of Lordsas life peers appointed by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in March 2000.
Life peers
Non-judicial life peers were not introduced until the Life Peerages Act 1958. In1998, there were 461 peers appointed under the 1958 Act: 81 female life peersand 380 male life peers. The award of a peerage is one of the highest honoursconferred in the United Kingdom. Approximately one third of formergovernment ministers will receive life peerages. Some former Prime Ministers– such as Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Heath – refused the award ofa peerage in order to remain in the House of Commons. Others will decline onpoint of political principle. Peerages are conferred by the Crown on the adviceof the Prime Minister. Twice a year – at New Year and on the Queen’sbirthday – honours are awarded. There are, occasionally, honours listsannounced to mark special occasions. Honours are also awarded on thedissolution of parliament and, if there is a change of government, theoutgoing Prime Minister will draw up a special honours list. However, thereis much evidence to suggest that the system of appointment is used politicallyby governments, a factor which further undermines the legitimacy of theHouse of Lords, and there currently exists no formal mechanism by which abalance between the parties can be established and maintained against thewishes of a Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister insists that the working lifepeers should reflect party-political strength in the House of Commons, as didMargaret Thatcher, and if, as was the case with the Conservative government,
52111 See The Ampthill Peerage Case (1977); Barony of Moynihan (1997).

13 This figure excludes the 78 peers who had applied for leave of absence and 86 who had
not applied for Writs of Summons.

that government is in power for a continuous period of 18 years, there is an
inbuilt bias in appointments. 
This was the legacy inherited by the Labour Government in 1997. In order
to redress the political imbalance, the Prime Minister appointed anunprecedented number of life peers, intended to be ‘working peers’, activelyparticipating in the work of the upper House. Of the 33 appointed in March2000, 20 are Labour, nine Liberal Democrat and four Conservative. WhereasMrs Thatcher appointed 203 peers in her 11 years of office, Tony Blairappointed 209 peers in under three years.
Once appointed, life peers tend to be more active in the House of Lords –
both in terms of attendance in the House and of participation in debate – thanhereditary peers.
Indeed, the Prime Minister made it clear that the appointment of new
Labour life peers carried with it the responsibility to attend the House at leastthree nights a week for late night votes which carry ‘three line whips’ in orderto ensure that the government gets its key legislation through parliament.Under current reform proposals, the conferment of a life peerage is to beseparated from entitlement to sit in the Lords.
14
Judicial peers
In 1856, for the first time, a life peerage was granted to a retired judge,although he was allowed neither to sit nor to vote in parliament. In 1876, theAppellate Jurisdiction Act provided that two Lords of Appeal in Ordinarycould be appointed as life peers, with both sitting and voting rights.
The Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were originally appointed to add legal
expertise to the House. In their judicial capacity, the Judicial Committee of theHouse of Lords represents the highest domestic court
15for civil appeals in the
United Kingdom and for criminal appeals from England, Wales and NorthernIreland.
16The Law Lords also sit as Members of the judicial Privy Council
which has jurisdiction to hear appeals from a limited number ofCommonwealth countries. Consideration of the judicial work of the LawLords should be kept distinct from consideration of their role in the otherfunctions of the House of Lords.
The Law Lords play a role in the legislative and other functions but, by
convention, do not participate in purely political debate. To do so woulddetract from the judicial impartiality which must be evident when acting in ajudicial capacity, and would have implications for the delicate balancemaintained in the separation of powers.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The House of Lords
In relation to legislation, the Law Lords’ role is at times both significant
and valuable, although it cannot be assumed that they act in a united
manner.17Their contributions express personal – not official judicial –
opinions. It is notable that Bills on family law matters – divorce,18domestic
violence, the law relating to children – are introduced in the House of Lordsunder the auspices of the Lord Chancellor. Other Law Lords make significantcontributions on controversial matters, some of which can bring them intoconflict with the government. D Shell, for example, instances the influenceexerted by Lord Chief Justice Parker on the issue of abolition of the deathpenalty (the Homicide Act 1957), and over the War Damage Bill 1965.
19
Lords Spiritual
In addition to the hereditary and life peers, 26 Archbishops and Bishops of theChurch of England sit in the Lords, and up to 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary(Law Lords). The explanation for the presence of Anglican Archbishops andBishops is historical. As seen above, until the dissolution of the monasteries,spiritual peers represented a majority in the House of Lords. Today, theirpresence is explained both on the basis of tradition and on the basis of theclose links between the established Church of England and the state. There arearguments for reform in this regard (see, further, below), but it should berecognised that the Spiritual Peers owe no allegiance to any political partyand, while by convention not speaking or voting on purely political issues,make a significant contribution to debate on many, often sensitive, moral andsocial issues, such as housing, divorce, abortion, homosexuality, embryologyand human fertilisation.
The oath of allegiance
Before becoming a full Member of the House, the new peer is formallyintroduced and takes the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
20
Government members in the Lords
In 1998, 23 peers were members of the government. The government isrepresented in the House by the Lord Chancellor, Leader of the House (LordPrivy Seal), Lord Advocate, five Ministers of State, seven Under Secretaries ofState, the Chief Whip and Deputy Chief Whip and seven whips.

Disqualification from membership of the Lords
Aliens
Aliens are disqualified from membership of the Lords under section 3 of the
Act of Settlement 1700, which provides that membership of the Houseexcludes:
... person[s] born out of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland or Ireland, or the
Dominions thereunto belonging ... (except such as are born of English parents).
The British Nationality Act 1981, Schedule 7, amends the Act of Settlement to
the effect that Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the Republic of Irelandare excluded from its provisions.
Persons under the age of 21
While the age of majority has been reduced from the age of 21 to the age of 18years by section 1 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969, no person succeedingto a peerage below the age of 21 may take his or her seat in the House.
21
Technically, persons under the age of 21 are not disqualified, but merelyineligible to take their seats until they reach the age of 21.
Bankrupts
Under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Acts,22no peer may sit whilst
adjudicated bankrupt. The disqualification ceases in accordance with theActs.
23It is a breach of privilege to sit whilst disqualified. 
Treason
Any peer convicted of treason is disqualified from sitting or voting as aMember of the House unless and until he has either completed his term ofimprisonment or received a pardon. 
The disclaimer of hereditary peerages24
Under the Peerage Act 1963, it became possible to disclaim a peerage. A peerwho disclaims his or her title does so irrevocably, but the disclaimer will notaffect the succession of the title to the next generation. Under the Act, a peersucceeding to a title before the passing of the Act had 12 months in which todisclaim the title. Peers succeeding to titles subsequently have one year withinwhich to disclaim succession, or, in the case of a person under the age of 21, aChapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

year from the date of attaining the age of 21. One exception exists to this rule.
If the successor is a Member of the House of Commons, or a candidate forelection to the House of Commons, at the date on which he inherits the title,the period for disclaimer is one month (section 2 of the Peerage Act 1963). Atotal of 11 peers (including Viscount Stansgate, now Tony Benn, Lord Humeand Lord Hailsham) have disclaimed titles under the Act. 
Leave of absence
Leave of absence from the House of Lords may be granted at any time duringa parliament by applying to the Clerk of the Parliaments. At the start of eachnew parliament, peers who have previously obtained leave of absence will beasked whether they wish it to continue. Where leave of absence is granted, it isexpected that the peer will not attend the House. Should he or she wish to doso, he may give one month’s notice of his intention to attend. However, thereis no mechanism by which the House can exclude a peer who has leave ofabsence but nevertheless attends the House. 
Attendance in the House
All peers are entitled to attend and vote in the House. Before becomingeligible to sit in the Lords, it is necessary to apply for and receive a Writ ofSummons. It is expected that Lords who have not taken leave of absence willattend as regularly as possible.

It can be seen from the table overleaf that the hereditary peers outnumbered
the life peers by two to one. One of the vehement arguments of somereformers was that the House of Lords was dominated by hereditary peerswho were, by virtue of their background and upbringing, innatelyconservative and hence supported the Conservative Party. If this was true,then the natural implication which followed was that the House of Lords wasnaturally sympathetic towards a Conservative government and naturallyhostile towards a Labour government. The bare statistics of membership,however, leave out an important dimension – that of the political allegiance ofthose who actually attended the House regularly and played a significant rolein the law making process.
Analysis reveals that prior to the removal of most of the hereditary
peers,
25although the Conservative peers formed a majority overall (in 1998
having 495 Members), when the opposition parties’ membership was totalled,
that was greater than the number of Conservative Party supporters. Lookingat those Members who attended over fifty per cent of all sittings, theConservative Members comprised 49 per cent of the total, with oppositionparties comprising 51 per cent.
From the above, it can be seen that the Conservative Party peers, whilst
numerically the largest group, did not, when compared with the number ofpeers of other parties (or none), command a majority. 
Lords’ expenses
No salary is payable to Members of the House of Lords. They are entitled toexpenses to cover the cost of travel, overnight accommodation, subsistenceand secretarial and other expenses pertaining to their parliamentary duties.One question which remains for future decision is whether, when the finalstage of reform takes place, there should be more substantial remuneration forparliamentary work.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Functions of the House of Lords
Until 1911, the powers of the Lords were equal to those of the Commons, withthe exception that the Lords recognised – by convention – the supremacy ofthe Commons in relation to financial matters and accepted that they had noright to initiate or amend Bills relating to finance. The Lords neverthelessclaimed the power to reject outright financial legislation, a power which,when exercised, led to a curtailment of their powers.
In the White Paper of 1968,
26which formed the basis for the Labour
government’s attempt further to reform the House of Lords, the followingfunctions of the House of Lords were recorded:
(a) the provision of a forum for debate on matters of public interest;
(b) the revision of Bills brought from the House of Commons;(c) the initiation of Public Bills and Private Members’ Bills;(d) the consideration of delegated legislation;(e) the scrutiny of the executive;(f) the scrutiny of private legislation;(g) select committee work;(h) the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Before considering the manner in which the House of Lords allocates its time,
it is useful to look at the overall time available to the House in a parliamentarysession.

The House of Lords contains a wealth of specialism and experience which isunmatched by the House of Commons. It is in part the introduction of lifepeers which explains the revival of the House of Lords. Perhaps the major

factor explaining the resurgence of activity in the Upper House lies in the
sheer volume of legislative work introduced by governments in recent years.
The majority of time in the Lords is devoted to the scrutiny of legislation,
both primary and secondary, which in the 2000–01 session occupied 61.1 percent of time. In the 1999–2000 session a record number of amendments tolegislation were tabled, 11,020, with 4,761 of these being agreed by theCommons.
27
Procedure in the House of Lords
To some extent, the procedure in the House of Lords mirrors that of the LowerHouse, although significant differences must be noted. The control ofprocedure lies within the Privileges of the House (see Chapter 18), and isregulated by the Leader of the House, the government Chief Whip and by theHouse as a whole. The Speaker of the House, the Lord Chancellor,
28has no
formal powers to control the House, but is under a duty to attend the Houseand to sit on the Woolsack. The duty to attend derives from a Standing Orderof the House made on 9 June 1660: ‘... that it is the duty of the Lord Chancelloror the Lord keeper of the great Seale of England ordinarily to attend the Lordshouse of Parlyament.’ That Standing Order, slightly amended, is still in force,and the Lord Chancellor attends all sittings of the House unless absent byreason of illness. His role, as Speaker of the House, however, has beendescribed as ‘ornamental and symbolic’,
29for the Lord Chancellor does not
have the same powers as the Speaker of the House of Commons. In thepassage of legislation, for example, there is no power to select amendmentsfor debate or to curtail debate. Whereas the Speaker in the Commons may rulethat certain proposed amendments cannot be debated – perhaps because theyare not strictly relevant to the content of the Bill – the House of Lords maydecide to debate any and all amendments.
The Leader of the House is a political appointment in the hands of the
Prime Minister, and the Leader of the House is a Member of Cabinet. It is hisor her principal duty to advise on matters of procedure and order. Thegovernment Chief Whip is responsible for the arrangement of governmentbusiness and consultation with other parties as to its arrangement. As with theWhip in the Commons, the Chief Whip sends out a weekly indication of theneed for Member’s attendance at particular items of business.
Having examined the composition of the House, the allocation of time and
the principal officials of the House, we can now turn our attention toexamining the actual business of the House. Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The House of Lords
GENERAL DEBATES
The importance of debates in the House of Lords, although occupying a
decreasing percentage of the time of the House, should not beunderestimated. Wednesdays are generally devoted to debates on matters ofgeneral public importance. One Wednesday per month is set aside for twoshort debates limited to two and a half hours, when the subject matter ischosen by backbench peers selected by ballot. Other debates take place as aresult of consultation between the political parties, and will be generallytimetabled to last for a maximum of either five hours or two and a half hours.In 2000, debates occupied 14 per cent of available time in the Lords. 
The subject matter for debate is wide ranging, and it is often commented
that the quality of debate in the House of Lords attains a higher standard thanthat in the House of Commons. In part, this is due to the less partisan natureof the House of Lords and, paradoxically, their very lack of accountabilityenhances their capacity for independence and openness. Since theintroduction of life peers in 1958, the quality of debate is enriched by thediverse backgrounds and experience of Members.
Questions in the House of Lords
Four types of questions are provided for under Standing Orders: starred,unstarred, written and private notice questions.
The daily business of the House commences with up to four starred
questions addressed to the government on four days per week. Notice mustbe given of the question to be asked, and each peer is restricted to twoquestions per day. The purpose of the question is not to initiate debate but tosecure information from the government. Unstarred questions are asked at theend of the day’s business and may initiate debate. They may be likened todaily adjournment debates in the Lower House. These are popular withMembers, providing an opportunity to initiate debate on a matter of publicinterest. Questions for written answer are printed on the Order Paper of theday and a government minister will reply within 14 days. The questions andreplies are printed in Hansard , the official journal of the House. There is no
limit on the number of questions which may be asked.
Private notice questions fulfil the same function as in the Lower House,
that is, to raise matters for urgent debate without the need to observe the strictrules of notice for other questions. Notice must be given to the Leader of theHouse by noon on the day on which the question is to be put, and the Leaderhas absolute discretion as to whether to allow the question to be put.

530THE SCRUTINY OF LEGISLATION
As has been seen above, the scrutiny of legislation occupies the largest, and an
increasing, proportion of the time of the House, and it is to this aspect of thework of the House that most attention must be paid. In 2000, 61.1 per cent ofthe time of the House was taken up with the consideration of governmentBills. 
Bills, other than financial Bills, which fall within the exclusive powers of
the House of Commons, can be introduced in either the Commons or theLords. The majority of government Bills will be introduced in the Commonsand, having passed the Commons’ stages of scrutiny, will be passed to theHouse of Lords, although many Bills are introduced in the Lords. The processof scrutiny in the Lords in many respects mirrors that in the Commons, andBills receive a formal first reading, followed by the second reading debate andthen ‘stand committed’ for the committee stage, after which the Bill isreported back to the House and then receives its third reading.
Legislative committees in the House of Lords
There are significant differences between the two Houses in the scrutiny oflegislation. First, in the House of Lords, there is no regular use of standingcommittees, and Bills will be considered in the Chamber by a Committee ofthe Whole House. In the 1991–92 session, a Select Committee of the House ofLords reviewed the role of committees in the House.
30The committee
considered extending the use of Public Bill Committees – the equivalent ofstanding committees in the House of Commons – but rejected the proposal. Amajority of witnesses to the committee opposed their introduction. In thewords of the committee, such committees were:
... unrepresentative of a non-partisan House; they increased the time required
on report; and breadth of experience and participation at committee stage wasconsidered desirable.
31
However, the House of Lords did make provision for Bills to be read off the
floor of the House in ‘Grand Committees’. All peers are entitled to attend andparticipate. The measure facilitates greater efficiency by freeing time in thechamber itself. The introduction of Special Public Bill Committees was, also,favourably considered in relation to a limited number of Bills and first used inthe 1994–95 session.
32The procedure reflects that of the special standing
committees in the Commons, with a limited period of time set aside for

consideration of the Bill, where the committee takes written and oral evidence
on the provisions of the Bill. The committee then reverts to standard standingcommittee procedure and examines the Bill clause by clause. The committeesare used to scrutinise Law Commission Bills which are introduced by the LordChancellor in the House of Lords. Note that select committees may also beused for the committee stage.
33
Curtailment of debate
A further difference between procedure in the Commons and the Lords lies inthe absence of procedures in the Lords for the curtailment of debate. Theabsence of the Closure Motion or the Allocation of Time Motion (Guillotine) inthe Lords ensures that the contents of Bills are fully debated; for details, seeChapter 15.
Party discipline in the House of Lords
There exists a system of ‘whipping’ which ensures some party political controlover Members, although the extent of that control is far less than the controlexerted by the whips in the Commons. The House of Lords is generally a farless party-political forum than the elected House of Commons. It must also beremembered that the House of Lords contains some 322 cross benchers, orindependents, who do not owe allegiance to any particular political party.This group represents a potentially significant force in so far as the way inwhich cross benchers will vote cannot necessarily be foreseen in advance, letalone guaranteed. These factors, together with the independence the Houseand not being accountable to an electorate, results in a scrutinising bodywhich can review legislation in depth and largely free from the political andprocedural controls which are prevalent in the House of Commons.
THE AMENDMENT OF LEGISLATION
The House of Lords has the power to delay enactment of a Bill under theParliament Acts 1911–49, but not to veto a Bill. As will be seen, thedemocratically elected Lower House has the ultimate right to enact legislationin the face of opposition from the Upper House. The House of Lords does,however, have the power to propose amendments to Bills and it is theirsuccess or otherwise in this regard which requires examination. At the outset,it must be recognised that amendments proposed are of differing types andare put forward in response to a variety of circumstances. Not all amendmentsproposed in the Lords and accepted by the House of Commons stem fromprincipled opposition in the House of Lords.
53133 House of Lords Procedure Committee, Third Report , 1993–94.

Some amendments are purely technical, amounting to tidying up of
statutory language. Others will be the result of government undertakings to
implement a proposed Commons’ amendment in the Lords. Amendmentsalso arise out of the government’s willingness to rethink an aspect of a Bill inlight of consideration in the Commons or within the department concernedwith the legislation. The Lords here acts as a convenient forum for proposingthe relevant amendments. 
It may be the case that there has been opposition in the Commons to a
particular proposal which the government has resisted, and has used itsmajority to that effect. If the government is prepared to concede a point,particularly where it foresees opposition in the Lords, it may prefer to giveway than to risk losing part of the Bill on a vote in the Lords. Negotiations willfrequently take place between the government department and thoseintending to oppose the measure in order to secure a satisfactory compromisewhich will ensure the smooth passage of the Bill into law.
Some amendments arise purely as a result of objections voiced in the
House of Lords. One recent example of principled opposition in the Lords, notapparent in the Lower House, is offered by the Child Support Bill 1991.
34In
that Bill, unmarried separated mothers on state benefit were to be placedunder a statutory duty to reveal the identity of the fathers of their children inorder that the Child Support Agency could enforce the financial duty offathers to support their children. When the Bill arrived in the Lords, clause 46,which offered no defence to the mother who declined to give the information,was rejected by the Lords. The Bill returned to the Commons and thegovernment reinstated the clause but made a concession to the Lords andinserted a defence of reasonably withholding information. On recent, postHouse of Lords Act 1999 activity, see below.
House of Lords’ amendments have a substantive impact on legislation. For
example, the House of Lords put forward amendments to the Education (No2) Bill 1980 which resulted in the government abandoning a proposal toimpose charges for school transport; amendments to the Local Government(Interim Provisions) Bill 1984 resulted in the government revising plansgoverning local government prior to the abolition of the Greater LondonCouncil and amendments to the 1992 Education (Schools) Bill resulted inchanges made to inspections of schools.
35
It can be seen that the House of Lords is both very active in relation to
legislation and makes a substantial impact on many legislative proposals.Most often, the House of Commons will give way to the Lords and accepttheir amendments, rather than risk losing a Bill for lack of parliamentary time.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
53234 See Barnett, 1993.
35 See Norton, 1993, Chapter 5; and, for an analysis of the treatment of government
legislation 1979–87, see Shell, 1992, Chapter 6. For a case study of the role of the House
of Lords, see Clarke and Shell, 1994.

The House of Lords
It must be remembered that, if a Bill fails to pass all of its stages within a
session, the Bill will be lost and the government must make time toreintroduce it in the next session. Accordingly, the later in a session a Bill isconsidered by the Lords, the greater will be the inclination of the House ofCommons to accept Lords’ amendments. 
In the run-up to the reform of the Lords, the House exercised its revising
powers robustly, opposing government measures, inter alia , relating to the
closed list system of proportional representation for the 1999 Europeanparliamentary elections, welfare and pensions reform, immigration andasylum, and the establishment of a London Authority and Mayor.
36The
House also threatened to exercise its powers to the full in relation to theHouse of Lords Bill, in defiance of the Salisbury convention that peers wouldnot block a government measure which had formed part of its manifestoprogramme. As noted above,negotiations between the then ConservativeLeader of the Lords, Viscount Cranborne, and the Prime Minister resulted in acompromise measure in which 92 hereditary peers would remain in the Lordsfollowing the removal of the majority of hereditaries.
The House of Lords following the 1999 Act
When parliamentary business resumed in January 2000, the majority ofhereditary peers had been ousted. It soon became clear, however, that the‘new’ House of Lords was not prepared to be more acquiescent towardsgovernment legislative proposals. Even before the new year started, the Lordswere proclaiming their renewed ‘legitimacy’ as a revising chamber, and soonmade an impact on the government’s legislative programme. The CriminalJustice (Mode of Trial) Bill, which in part removed the right of defendantscharged with ‘either way offences’, such as theft and burglary, to choose theirmode of trial, was introduced in the Lords. The effect of this is that theParliament Act procedures do not apply, thus making it easier for the Lords topress home its objections to the Bill successfully. The Lords rejected the Bill,forcing the government to reintroduce the Bill in the Commons where atsecond reading the government secured a substantial majority. The House ofLords again rejected the Bill and it was withdrawn. The Lords also opposedthe government’s proposal to repeal ‘Section 28’, which prohibits thepromotion of homosexuality in education. Difficulty was also caused by theLords over the government’s proposal to lower the age of consent forhomosexual sex to 16 years, opposing the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill,and forcing the government to employ the Parliament Act procedure. TheCare Standards Bill, which would introduce regulation of private hospitals
53336 European Parliamentary Elections Bill 1998; Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill 1999;
Immigration and Asylum Bill 1999; Greater London Authority Bill 1998, respectively.

and establish two bodies to inspect and impose standards, one for National
Health Service hospitals, one for private hospitals, was also opposed by theLords, which inflicted its tenth defeat on government legislative proposalssince the removal of the hereditary peers in 1999.
The House of Lords and delegated legislation
The House of Lords’ Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee’s principalconcern is to scrutinise Bills with a view to establishing the extent oflegislative powers which parliament intends to delegate to governmentministers. Prior to the establishment of the committee, Bills with potentially oractually contentious delegated powers took up a large amount of time in theHouse of Lords’ legislative debates. The committee’s prior scrutiny of Billspresaging delegated powers, and its approval thereof, means that this issue nolonger occupies legislative time in the consideration of the Bill by the House.The role of the Committee is ‘to report whether the provision of any Billinappropriately delegates legislative power, or whether they subject theexercise of legislative power to an inappropriate degree of parliamentaryscrutiny’. The committee reports to the House, which decides whether or notto accept the committee’s recommendations. The committee has eightmembers and meets as needs require. The committee hears oral evidence inpublic, and takes evidence in writing on each public Bill from the relevantgovernment department. 
The committee, in the examination of a Bill, considers four principal
matters. First, the committee considers whether the power to make delegated,or secondary, legislation is appropriate, or whether the grant of power is soimportant that it should only be granted in primary legislation. Secondly, thecommittee pays special attention to Henry VIII powers . A Henry VIII power is a
power to change the law without parliamentary action, that is to say, theprimary legislation may be amended or repealed by subordinate legislationwith or without further parliamentary scrutiny. Thirdly, the committeeconsiders which form of parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation isappropriate, and in particular whether the power specifies the use of theaffirmative or negative resolution procedure.
37Fourthly, the committee
considers whether the legislation should provide for consultation in draftform before the regulation is laid before parliament, and whether its operationshould be governed by a Code of Conduct. 
The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 introduced a new form of
delegated legislation. Under the Act, a minister may issue a deregulationorder to amend or repeal any enactment of primary legislation with a view toremoving or reducing any administrative or bureaucratic element. The aim istowards greater efficiency in administration. The power is exercisableChapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
53437 See, further, Chapter 15.

The House of Lords
provided that no necessary protection is removed from the law. The 1994 Act
provides for parliamentary scrutiny. The two stage process involves, first, theproposal being laid before parliament as a draft order. The Lords’ committee,and the House of Commons equivalent committee have 60 days in which toreport. Secondly, the government then lays a draft order before parliament,either in its original form or amended to take account of the two committees’opinions, for approval by a resolution of each House. The House of Lords canonly approve the draft order after the committee has made a second report onthe order.
The committee is concerned with four principal matters. First, whether the
measure is intra vires ; secondly, that the measure removes the relevant
administrative burden; thirdly, whether the order removes any required‘necessary protection’; and, fourthly, whether the consultation required underthe Act has been adequate. The committee takes oral and written evidence. In1995, the committee rejected a proposed draft deregulation order in relation tocharges being permitted for public dances held on Sundays. The SundayObservance Act 1780 prohibits charging for public dances. The deregulationproposal aimed to exempt dances from the 1780 Act and allow premises to belicensed for Sunday dancing, and to extend the permitted hours for the sale ofalcohol at dances on Sunday nights. Having heard oral evidence andconsidered written evidence, the committee rejected the proposal. In thecommittee’s opinion, the subject matter was unsuitable for such an expeditedprocedure and, further, the prior consultation had been inadequate. In the2000–01 session, the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee made 43reports and reported on 53 Bills.
THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949
Where the House of Commons is not prepared to accept Lords’ amendments,or where the House of Lords rejects a Bill outright, the role of the ParliamentActs must be considered. The Parliament Act 1911 altered the balance ofpower between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, restrictingthe powers of the Upper House. Until that Act, the House of Lords enjoyedequal power with the Commons over legislation, with the exception offinancial measures which, by convention, the Lords recognised as fallingunder the authority of the elected Lower House. However, in 1909, theFinance Bill containing Lloyd George’s Budget was rejected, in breach ofconvention, by the House of Lords. As a consequence, the House of Commonspassed a Resolution declaring that there had been a breach of the constitutionand a usurpation of the rights of the Commons and calling for the power of
535

Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
536the House of Lords to be restricted. King Edward VII was called upon to
create sufficient new peers to guarantee the passage of the Finance Bill butrefused to do so until the Budget was approved by the electorate. Parliamentwas dissolved and, in the election in January 1910, the government secured amajority of seats only with the help of minor parties. The House of Lords thenpassed the Finance Bill.
This conflict between the House of Commons and House of Lords resulted
in the Parliament Act 1911, passed by both Houses of Parliament but with theHouse of Lords being threatened with the creation of more peers to ensure theBill’s safe passage. The Act abolished the Lords’ right to reject Money Bills,
38
and imposed a one month time limit during which the Lords may considersuch Bills and suggest amendments. If the Bill has not been approved withoutamendment within one month, provided it has been sent to the Lords withinone month before the end of the session, the Bill will proceed to receive theroyal assent without the approval of the Lords. Not all financial bills areMoney Bills. Where a Bill contains provision dealing with other subjects it willnot be a Money Bill. The Finance Bill is not automatically a Money Bill, andover half of the Finance Bills sent to the Lords since the 1911 Act have notbeen certified as Money Bills. Similarly, the Local Government Finance Bill1988, which introduced the Poll Tax, was not certified as a Money Bill and,accordingly, was considered by the House of Lords. While the purpose of the1911 Act is to prevent amendment or delay in Money Bills, should the Lordspropose amendments, these can be either accepted or rejected by theCommons. By way of example, the Commons accepted Lords’ amendments tothe following certified Bills: the China Indemnity Bill 1925; theUnemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions) Extension Bill 1935–36; theInshore Fishing Industry Bill 1947; and the Industrial Development (Ships) Bill1969–70.
Regarding non-Money Bills, the power of the House of Lords was
curtailed, their right to reject legislation replaced by a power to delay Bills fora two year period spread over three parliamentary sessions.
Conflict between the two Houses resurfaced over the Labour
government’s nationalisation programme following the Second World War.The Labour government, fearful that the Lords would reject the Iron and SteelBill, introduced the Parliament Bill in 1947. In 1948, a conference betweenparty leaders from both Houses met to attempt to reach agreement on theterms of the Parliament Bill. In the event, the conference broke down and theParliament Bill was rejected by the House of Lords at second reading, only tobe passed by the Commons under the Parliament Act 1911. The 1949 Actreduced the House of Lords’ power of delay over non-Money Bills from twoyears over three sessions to one year over two sessions. No amendment wasmade to the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911 regarding Money Bills. 
38 Bills certified by the Speaker as Money Bills, defined by the Parliament Act 1911, s 1(2).

The House of Lords
Exclusions from the Parliament Acts
The Parliament Acts do not apply to private Bills, Bills originating in the
House of Lords, Bills containing financial measures but not certified as MoneyBills (because they contain other non-money provisions), statutoryinstruments or Bills purporting to extend the life of a parliament beyond thefive years laid down in the Septennial Act 1715, as amended by section 7 ofthe Parliament Act 1911. 
The use of the Parliament Acts
It is notable that the Parliament Acts have been used infrequently. Aside fromthe Parliament Act 1949, which was passed under the 1911 Act, theGovernment of Ireland Act 1914, the Welsh Church Act 1914 and the WarCrimes Act 1991 were passed under this procedure. More recently, theEuropean Parliamentary Elections Bill 1998 attracted the procedure, the Lordsobjecting to the chosen method of voting which enhanced party politicalcontrol over the election of candidates at the expense of voter choice. Theexplanation for the low use of the procedure largely lies in conventionalpractices regulating the relationship between the two Houses. First, as hasbeen seen above, the House of Commons accepts a great many Lords’amendments, for a variety of reasons. Secondly, the House of Lords exercisesits delaying powers with some caution. In debate on the War Damage Bill1965, Lord Salisbury stated that the House of Lords should insist onamendments under two circumstances:
(a) if a matter raises issues important enough to justify such ‘drastic’ action;
(b) if the issue is such that the electorate can understand it and express
approval for the House of Lord’s position. In this regard, the House of
Lords acts as a ‘watchdog of the people’.
In 1975, in debate, Lord Carrington39stated that:
(a) the House of Lords should not insist on opposing a government Bill for
which there is a mandate from the people (the ‘Salisbury doctrine’);40
(b) but that the House of Lords may impose delay if the constitution otherwise
would be at risk; or
(c) if public opinion was against the government.
Lord Carrington asserted that, in rare cases, the Lords could legitimately
enforce a delay so as to cause a reassessment by the government and thepeople. Thirdly, if the House of Lords strongly disapproves of a measure butdoes not wish to defeat the Bill, it may move a resolution deploring parts ofthe Bill, as occurred in relation to the Immigration Bill 1971 and the BritishNationality Act 1981. Fourthly, many disagreements between the House ofCommons and the House of Lords will be resolved by negotiations between
53739 HL Deb Vol 365 Col 1742, 11 November 1975.
40 HL Deb Vol 261 Col 66, 4 November 1964.

the two Houses which generally will result in the avoidance of ultimate
deadlock. Finally, the Parliament Act procedure may be avoided under theamendment procedure laid down in section 2(4) of the Parliament Act 1911.Under that section, the Acts may only be used if the House of Lords, over twosuccessive sessions, rejects the same Bill. A Bill will be deemed to be the sameBill if it is identical with the former Bill ‘or contains only such alterations asare certified by the Speaker to be necessary owing to the time which haselapsed since the date of the former Bill, or to represent any amendmentswhich have been made by the House of Lords in the former Bill in thepreceding session’.
41If amendments have been made which are not agreed to
by the Commons, the Bill is deemed to be rejected. This formulation facilitatesagreements between the two Houses, yet preserves the ultimate possible useof the Parliament Act procedure. Three Bills over which conflict wasultimately avoided by this process were the Temperance (Scotland) Bill 1913;the Trades Union and Labour Relations Bill 1975–76; and the ShipbuildingIndustry Bill 1976–77.
A more recent illustration of the working of the amendment procedure is
provided by the Teaching and Higher Education Bill 1997, which wasintroduced into the House of Lords and was thus not susceptible to theParliament Act procedure. The government intended to introduce tuition feesfor students at Scottish universities which would have the effect of penalisingstudents attending those universities from England, Wales and NorthernIreland, but not Scottish students. The House of Lords, objecting on principleto this discriminatory treatment between Scottish and other students,amended the offending section. The House of Commons rejected theamendment. On the Bill’s return to the House of Lords, on two furtheroccasions, the House of Lords introduced a newly worded amendment – anamendment in lieu – which had the same substantive effect of removing the
alleged discrimination.
42The House of Lords had thus rejected the
government’s proposal three times, risking the loss of the Bill in the 1997–98session. The Secretary of State for Education rejected the House of Lords’ viewand claimed that, while ‘it is right that the Lords should scrutinise it [the Bill]’,having had ‘its advice rejected three times by the elected House – on a matterwith financial consequences – it cannot be right for the unelected House, yetagain, to refuse to accept that decision’.
43Compromise was, however,
reached. The House of Lords finally agreed to accept the will of the Commons,but only after securing the government’s agreement to ‘consider therecommendations ... very seriously’ made by a newly established independentreview body to examine fee arrangements.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
53841 Erskine May, 1997.
42 The Parliament Act 1911, as amended by the Parliament Act 1949, s 2(4), provides for
this ‘ping pong’ procedure, by (in part) deeming a Bill to be the same Bill only where ‘it
is identical with the former Bill ...’.

The House of Lords
Suspension Motions
The Suspension Motion is a device currently available in relation to Private
Bills which facilitates their passage through parliament. Where the SuspensionMotion is agreed by the House of Commons, a Private Bill may be carriedover form one session to another, without the loss of that Bill.
The House of Commons Procedure Committee and the House of Lords
Procedure Committee have recently agreed to extend the procedure to PublicBills. Where a Bill is in the Commons at the end of one session, and aSuspension Motion is agreed, that Bill will be able to continue its life into thenext session. However, the procedure is not designed to ‘rescue’ contentiousBills over which the two Houses disagree.
44Rather, the procedure will apply
to those Bills which the government notifies to the House of Commons ascandidates for the ‘carry over’ procedure. It will be for the Commons to agreethe motion to suspend the Bill, should the need arise.
SELECT COMMITTEES IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
The House of Lords has no structured system of select committees as exists inthe House of Commons. However, three types of select committees exist in theLords. The House may establish ad hoc committees to consider a matter of
public importance: such committees have considered Sport and Leisure(1971–72), Unemployment (1979–82), Overseas Trade (1984–85), Murder andLife Imprisonment (1988–89). Domestic select committees exist to considermatters of procedure and privileges of the House. In addition, as has beenseen, Bills may be committed to select committee for in depth considerationand report.
Twenty sessional committees exist.
45Significant among these are the
European Community Select Committee and the Science and TechnologyCommittee. The former was established in 1974 to consider Commissionproposals for European legislation. The committee has acquired a reputationfor authoritative scrutiny of the proposals. The committee has a salariedchairman and 24 permanent Members, a considerable staff of clerks and legaladvisers and has the right to appoint expert advisers as and when needed.The committee also has the power to appoint sub-committees.
46Each year, the
53944 Eg, the Crime and Disorder Bill 1998, which provided for the lowering of the age of
consent to sexual intercourse between men.
45 Two Appeal Committees; two Appellate Committees; Leave of Absence and Expenses
Committee; Personal Bills; Hybrid Instruments; Standing Orders (Private Bills); Joint
Select Committees on Consolidation Bill; Statutory Instruments; EuropeanCommunities; House of Lords Offices; Committee for Privileges; Procedure; Scienceand Technology; Committee of Selection; Committee on Broadcasting; Joint Committeeon Human Rights; Constitution Committee; and Economic Affairs Committee.
46 Six sub-committees have been established, considering such diverse matters as Law and
Institutions, Energy, Transport and Technology, Environment, Finance, Trade andExternal Relations.

select committee produces some 20 reports, all of which (unlike those of the
House of Commons) are debated in the Chamber. The governmentundertakes to respond to the reports within two months, and not later thanthree months, of a report’s publication. The European Community SelectCommittee’s terms of reference are:
To consider Community proposals whether in draft or otherwise, to obtain all
necessary information about them, and to make reports on those which, in theopinion of the committee, raise important questions to which the committeeconsiders that the special attention of the House should be drawn.
The committee has seven sub-committees: Economic and Financial Affairs,
Trade and External Relations; Energy, Industry and Transport; Environment,Public Health and Consumer Protection; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Lawand Institutions; Social Affairs, Education and Home Affairs. In addition, ad
hoccommittees are established to deal with specific proposals. 
With the establishment of the European Union in 1992, the House of
Lords’ European Communities Committee took the view that aspects of theUnion’s work should be scrutinised by the national parliament.
47The
Common Foreign and Security Policy pillar of the Union, and the Judicial andPolice Co-operation in Criminal Matters pillar do not involve legislation, butinter-governmental co-operation. The committee took the view thatdocuments should be provided to parliament if they qualify under one ofthree tests, namely: significance; eventual need for United Kingdomlegislation or the imposition of legal commitments on the United Kingdom.
48
The Science and Technology Select Committee of the House of Lords was
set up in 1980. The committee is unique in that it provides a forum for inquiry,examination, debate and recommendation over an important subject which isnot represented in any one House of Commons committee. Subjects whichhave been given in depth examination include Hazardous Waste Disposal(1980–81), Civil Research and Development (1986–87) and Priorities inMedical Research (1987–88). The government undertakes to respond toreports of the committee in writing. Reports are debated in the Chamber of theHouse of Lords. 
In the 2000–01 session, three new sessional committees were established.
The Joint Committee on Human Rights, with six members drawn from eachHouse, considers matters relating to the implementation of the Human RightsAct 1998 and human rights aspects of legislation. The Constitution Committeewas first appointed in 2001 to examine the constitutional implications of allpublic Bills before the House, and to review the working of the constitution.The new Economic Affairs Committee was also appointed in 2001.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
54047 House of Lords, Twenty-Eighth Report , 1992–93.
48 The government agreed: see Cm 2471, 1994, London: HMSO. 

The House of Lords
The Steering Committee
In order to co-ordinate better the work of committees in the Lords, there is a
Steering Committee which serves functions similar to those of the LiaisonCommittee in the Commons – namely, deciding on subjects for investigationby ad hoc select committees, allocating resources between differing select
committees and monitoring the work of the committees.
Members’ interests in the Lords 
In November 1995, a Register of Members’ Interests was established, in whicha number of interests must be recorded. The requirements are that threecategories of interests must be registered, namely:
(a) consultancies or other similar arrangements involving payment or other
incentive or reward for providing parliamentary advice or services.
Registration under this category is mandatory;
(b) financial interests in businesses involved in parliamentary lobbying on
behalf of clients. This requirement is also mandatory;
(c) other particulars relating to matters which the Lords consider may affect
the public perception of the way in which they discharge theirparliamentary duties. Registration under this category is discretionary.
Interests should be declared in debate whenever Lords have a direct financialinterest in a subject, along with any other interest which might affect thejudgment of the House. The Committee on Lords’ Interests has power toinvestigate allegations of failure to comply with the requirements. The registeris published annually.
REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
With a perfect Lower House it is certain that an Upper House would be
scarcely of any value ... But though beside an ideal House of Commons theLords would be unnecessary, and therefore pernicious, beside the actualHouse a revising and leisured legislature is extremely useful ...
49
Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties have long had proposals to
reform the House of Lords. As seen above, the current Labour government istranslating its commitment into reality, as a first step removing the right of themajority of hereditary peers to sit and vote. In the past, the Labour Party hasadvocated total abolition of the Upper House. Much of the antagonism to theLords stems from basic principles of democracy, its opponents centering onthe fundamental paradox of a sophisticated democratic state having, as part ofits legislative body, an unelected and democratically unaccountable
54149 Bagehot (1867), 1993, pp 133–34.

institution. Before the issue of principle and its implications for reform can be
addressed, it is essential to understand the actual working of the House. Anote of caution regarding these important matters should be observed at thisearly stage. SA de Smith and R Brazier make the pertinent observation that:
Agreement in principle amongst the sophisticated tends to be less than whole
hearted and to beget new disagreements when principle is translated intodetail. Real enthusiasm for Lords’ reform is too often to be found among theeccentric and the naive, who may have little idea of the mediocre performanceof second chambers in so many other countries or of the limited expectationsthat can reasonably be reposed in a reconstituted British second chamber.[1989, p 311]
As noted above, the preamble to the Parliament Act 1911 envisaged replacing
the House of Lords with an elected House:
And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present
exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis,but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation ...
This did not represent the first proposal to reform the House of Lords. As
early as 1886 and 1888, debate took place in the House of Commons on thedesirability or otherwise of an hereditary element in the legislature. As hasbeen seen above, the constitutional conflict between the House of Lords andCommons in 1908–10 resulted in the restriction on the Lords’ powers and theintent to replace the House of Lords.
In 1917, a conference comprising 15 Members of each House was
established, under the chairmanship of Viscount Bryce, to consider thecomposition and powers of the Upper House. Reporting in 1918, theconference recommended that the Upper House should consist of 246Members indirectly elected by Members of Parliament grouped into regionalunits, plus 81 Members chosen by a joint standing committee of both Housesof Parliament. The conference regarded the appropriate functions of thisrevised chamber to be the examination and revision of Commons Bills, theinitiation of non-controversial Bills, the discussion of policy, and the‘interposition of so much delay (and no more) in the passing of a Bill into lawas may be needed to enable the opinion of the nation to be adequatelyexpressed upon it’. No action was taken on the recommendations.
Following the First World War, reform of the House of Lords remained on
the political agenda. A Cabinet committee established to consider the matterrejected the Bryce conference proposals as unacceptable. In 1922, thegovernment put forward proposals for a House of Lords made up of 350Members. The majority of these were to be either directly or indirectly elected‘from the outside’, with the remainder comprising some hereditary peerselected by peers, plus Members nominated by the Crown. The precisenumbers of these latter categories were to be laid down in statute. No actionresulted from these proposals. Between 1924 and 1935 one further set ofChapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
542

The House of Lords
Cabinet committee proposals was rejected, as were three Private Members’
Bills introduced by Conservative peers in 1929, 1933 and 1935. The ParliamentAct 1949, discussed above, was passed by the Labour government andremains the basis for the relationship between the Houses of Commons andLords today.
Reform remained on the agenda in the 1950s, the Conservative Party
Manifesto of 1951 promising a further all-party conference on reform. The
Labour Party in 1953 declined to co-operate and no further action was taken.In 1958, two significant reforms were introduced by the Conservativegovernment. The first of these related to the problem of the ‘backwoodsmen’:those peers who make no contribution to the work of the House butnevertheless retain the right to sit and vote when called upon to do so by thegovernment. The report of a House of Lords select committee recommendedthat Standing Orders be amended to enable those peers who did not regularlyattend the House to take leave of absence. This recommendation was adoptedbut it did not produce an effective solution to the problem posed by the‘backwoodsmen’. The remaining defect lay in the fact that, even where leaveof absence is obtained, there is no mechanism existing whereby a peer can bedenied the right to enter the House, even if he has not complied with therequirement to give once month’s notice of his intention to return to theHouse.
The Life Peerage Act 1958
The second reform of 1958 was the introduction of the Life Peerage Act. ThisAct enables the Crown, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to confer peeragesfor life on men and women who have reached prominence in public life. Thissingle reform has effectively revitalised the Upper House, providing anincreased resource of specialisation and experience. By convention, lifepeerages are conferred on Members of any political party, and on those whohave no particular political affiliation. Towards this end, the leaders of themajor political parties put forward nominations to the Prime Minister on anannual basis. The Labour Party in the 1980s refused to make any nominationsat all, basing their refusal on principled objection to the elitist nature of theHouse of Lords. This stance has proven to be something of an ‘own goal’ forthe Labour Party, whose membership of the House of Lords is now smallerthan it might otherwise have been.
The Peerage Act 1963
In 1963, a more limited, but nonetheless important, reform was implemented.The Peerage Act 1963 has its origins in the succession to a peerage by AnthonyWedgwood-Benn (as he then was), a Member of the House of Commons. As aresult of succeeding to the title of Viscount Stansgate, Tony Benn, the Member

Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
544for Bristol South East50was barred from taking his seat in the Commons. A
joint committee of the Houses of Commons and Lords reported on this matter
in 1962 and recommended reform. As noted earlier, the Peerage Act 1963provides that a person succeeding to a peerage may disclaim his peeragewithin one year of his succession,
51and that a Member of the House of
Commons may disclaim within a one month period from succession. Thedisclaimer is irrevocable, but operates only for the lifetime of the peerdisclaiming the title: the title will devolve to his heir upon his death. Section 6of the the Peerage Act 1963 provides for the first time that peeresses in theirown right are entitled to sit and vote in the House of Lords.
The 1968 reform proposals
The Labour government of 1967–69 again turned its attention to reform of thecomposition of the House of Lords. The party Manifesto of 1966 declared the
intention to introduce reforms to safeguard measures approved by the Houseof Commons against delay or defeat in the House of Lords. An all-partyconference took place in 1967–68, at which substantial cross-party agreementwas reached on the proposals for reform. The resultant government WhitePaper of 1968
52proposed that there should be a two tier House. The first tier
would consist of 230 voting peers who satisfied a test of attendance on aregular basis. The second tier would consist of peers who remained entitled toattend and to participate in debate, but would not be entitled to vote. Theright to a seat in the House of Lords by virtue of succession to a peeragewould be removed but existing peers (who did not satisfy the attendancecriteria) would either become non-voting peers or might be conferred a lifepeerage with entitlement to vote. It was recommended that the government ofthe day should have a small, but not overall, majority of voting peers in theHouse. The White Paper also recommended that the power of delay by theHouse of Lords be reduced to a six month period. The White Paper wasapproved by the House of Lords by 251 votes to 56. An alliance of the far rightof the Conservative Party and the left wing of the Labour Party in the Houseof Commons caused the White Paper to be rejected by 270 votes to 159.
The government proceeded to introduce the Parliament (No 2) Bill 1968 to
give effect to the White Paper. The Bill received a Second Reading by 285votes to 185, but the committee stage, taken as a committee of the WholeHouse, became protracted and, after over 80 hours of consideration, the PrimeMinister announced the withdrawal of the Bill.

The House of Lords
The Labour government’s reform agenda 
The first commitment made in relation to the House of Lords by the Labour
Party before its election to office in 1997 was to abolish, as a first measure, thevoting rights of hereditary peers. Consistent with this proposal is the removalof the right of members of the Royal Family to vote in the House of Lords. Thegovernment’s ultimate objective, as stated in its election Manifesto, was toreplace the current House of Lords with a new elected second chamber,elected under a system of proportional representation. The elected House,according to the Manifesto, would have the power to delay, for the lifetime ofa parliament, changes to ‘designated legislation reducing individual orconstitutional rights’. However, as will be seen below, the Labour Party’splans for reforming the Lords changed significantly once elected togovernment.
Once in office, the Labour government moved cautiously. A Royal
Commission was established to consider the next phase in reform and to makerecommendations. All reform of the House of Lords is problematic. The 1968reforms failed to be implemented, not because of opposition in the House ofLords, but through opposition in the House of Commons, which crossed partylines. The opposition arose from the Commons’ perception that removing theright of hereditary peers to vote would enhance the authority of the House ofLords, and would risk the Lords becoming more bold in its dealing with theHouse of Commons. One key question for the Royal Commission and thegovernment, therefore, was how to move forward to the second reform stagein order to produce an effective and valuable second chamber withoutthreatening the supremacy of the democratically elected House of Commons.
The problem of legitimacy remained after the removal of the hereditary
peers’ right to vote. Given the fact of political patronage, for services renderedto the Party or country, the life peers have no more constitutional legitimacythan do hereditary peers. Thus, removing the hereditary peers from the Houseof Lords did not effect any constitutional change of real value, and certainlydid not mark a move towards greater democratic legitimacy, but representedno more than a starting point for further, largely undefined, future reform, theconsequences of which, in terms of the distribution of power between the twoHouses, will depend on both the nature and scope of the reform. 
The Royal Commission Report: a House for the future
The Royal Commission Report was published in January 2000. To thedisappointment of those advocating radical reform, the Commissionrecommended that the Upper House, having around 550 members, comprisea majority of nominated members and a minority of selected or electedmembers representing regional interests. However, despite widespreadconsultation, the Commission reached no consensus on the most difficult
545

issue: the number of selected or elected members and the method by which
members would be selected. 
The powers of the second chamber would remain broadly as they are at
present, with the second chamber being able to delay, but ultimately not todefeat, primary legislation. The Salisbury convention should continue to berespected. The report recommends that there be greater use of pre-legislativescrutiny of Bills. In relation to secondary legislation, the second chambershould be given power to delay their implementation and to voice itsconcerns. The power to defeat secondary legislation – in practice, never used –would be removed. 
In relation to composition, three options were put forward. Model A
provided for 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seatsaccording to each party’s share of the vote in that region at general elections,with one third of the regions selecting regional members at each generalelection. Model B, supported by a majority of the Commission, proposed 87members, directly elected at the same time as the European Parliamentelections under a system of proportional representation. Model C provides for195 regional members directly elected at the same time as the EuropeanParliament elections. 
On the system of nominations for the House, the Commission
recommended that an independent Appointments Commission beestablished. Establishing the Commission severs the link between the grantingof honours and the political patronage of the Prime Minister and government.Members of the House of Lords – the new name for which the Commissiondid not decide – would not be known as ‘peers’. The current system ofgranting of honours would remain, but would not result in membership of theHouse of Lords. The granting of a peerage is therefore no longer to be aprecondition for membership of the second chamber. The remaininghereditary peers will cease to be entitled to sit and vote once the regionalmembers join the second chamber. Hereditary peers will, however, be eligibleto seek nomination as regional members or apply for appointment by theAppointments Commission. The Commission will be under a duty tomaintain balance in the composition of the House of Lords. The Commissionshould ensure that at least 20 per cent of the members are not affiliated to oneof the major parties; it should be under a statutory duty to ensure that aminimum of 30 per cent of new members are female, with the aim ofgradually achieving gender balance within the House. It will also be requiredto attempt to ensure a representative level of membership from ethnicminority groups and appropriate representation for all religious faiths (but seebelow). Regional members would serve for the equivalent of ‘three electoralcycles’ and appointed members should serve for a fixed 15 year term. Theearliest the new system for regional members would operate would be 2004.Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
546

The House of Lords
The Commission recommended that existing life peers, appointed before
the publication of the report, who wish to remain in the second chamber
should be deemed to have been appointed for life, whereas life peersappointed between the publication of the report and the necessary legislationimplementing the report’s recommendations should be deemed to beappointed for a 15 year term from the date of the award of the life peerage.
On remuneration, the Commission recommended that the financial
arrangements be adequate to make regular attendance economically viable,and that remuneration should be linked to attendance in parliament.Payments made, however, for time and lost income should be less than thebasic salary of a Member of Parliament over an average session. 
The report’s recommendations were removed from the aspirations of
those seeking a democratically elected second chamber. That radical optionfoundered on the problem of the constitutional balance of power between twoelected chambers, and the fear – which has always dogged reform of theHouse of Lords – that the Commons might lose its supremacy. But theWakeham Report did foresee a second chamber with at least the same powersas the current House of Lords, and one which is broadly representative ofBritish society. In breaking the link between peerages and membership of thesecond chamber, the Commission has removed one of the most contentiousaspects of the political honours system in which membership of the secondchamber is seen to be conferred for political services to the governing party.Instead, the Commission seeks a second chamber which ‘should beauthoritative, confident, and broadly representative of the whole of Britishsociety’, and its members should have a breadth of experience outside theworld of politics, skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment ofconstitutional matters. The Commission stated that its intention was torecommend proposals which were not only ‘persuasive and intellectuallycoherent but also workable, durable and politically realistic’.
53
In 2000, the House of Lords Appointments Commission was established,
which has the function of nominating all cross-bench (independent) peers tothe House of Lords.
54The Commission takes over the role formerly played by
the Prime Minister.55
54753 In 2000 a Private Members’ Bill, the Life Peerages (Appointments Commission) Bill, was
introduced, detailing the procedure and criteria for appointment to the House of Lords.
That Bill failed. On the current arrangements, see below.
54 HL Deb Vol 60 Col WA179, 25 January 2000.
55 The Commission contacted 10,000 organisations, urging them to inform their members
and staff, but no public advertisements were placed. The first 15 Members appointed all
nominated themselves. 

Chapter 17: Constitutional and Administrative Law
548The government’s response to the Royal Commission Report
The government signalled its acceptance in principle of the Report. However,
the White Paper published in November 2001 made clear that only a minorityof peers would be elected.
56The stated aim is to reduce the size of the House
from 700 to 600 members over ten years, with 120 Members directly elected;up to 332 Members nominated by party leaders and 120 non-party(independent) Members being chosen by the independent AppointmentsCommission. The number of bishops will be reduced to 16 from 26 and therewill remain at least 12 law lords. The rights of the remaining hereditary peersto sit will be removed. The government rejected the call for more diversereligious representation and the proposal that Members should be salaried. 
It was expected that a Draft Bill would be presented in Spring 2002,
following the government’s consideration of responses to its White Paper.However, that expectation was dashed when disputes arose over theproportion of Members who would be directly elected, with members of thegovernment and the Labour Party opposing the 20 per cent proposal.Meanwhile the Commons Public Administration Committee proposed that 60per cent of Members should be elected. This is opposed by members of thegovernment who fear that such a substantial proportion of elected Memberswould threaten the supremacy of the House of Commons. The governmenthas delayed any legislation until the 2002–03 session of parliament.

CHAPTER 18
DEFINITION AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
SIGNIFICANCE OF PRIVILEGE
The privileges of parliament are those rules of both Houses of Parliament
which offer protection from outside interference – from whatever source – tothe Houses collectively, and to individual members. Erskine May definesprivilege as being: 
... the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a
constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of eachHouse individually, without which they could not discharge their functions,and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals. Thus,privilege, though part of the law of the land, is to a certain extent an exemptionfrom the general law. [1997, p 69]
Parliamentary privilege provides protection for Members of Parliament
against accusations of defamation from outside parliament and also protectsthe individual member – in the exercise of his or her freedom of speech – fromthe executive. 
Parliamentary privilege presents some intriguing constitutional issues. In
some respects, privilege may be compared with the royal prerogative, in so faras both privilege and the prerogative represent a unique aspect of legal powerreserved exclusively for a special class of persons. Moreover, parliamentaryprivilege is a legal power in respect of which the courts – mindful of thedoctrine of separation of powers – will be cautious in accepting jurisdiction toregulate. By asserting special powers and immunities for parliament as awhole, and for its members individually, parliament throws around itself acloak of protection which provides rights and immunities not accorded toindividual citizens. The balance which is – and ought to be – struck betweenlegitimate and necessary safeguards for parliament and its members in theexercise of parliamentary duties and the rights of individuals to the protectionof the general law is not always satisfactorily achieved. 
The law and practice of privilege reveals the extent to which individual
members and parliament as a body are free from outside pressure – whetherfrom interest groups, sponsoring bodies and institutions or the media – afreedom which is central to ensure an independent parliament. However, asMarshall and Moodie point out, ‘the boundary lines between free comment,legitimate pressure, and improper interference are obviously not easy toformulate in principle’ (1971, p 112). 
549PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE

The law and custom of parliament
The privileges enjoyed form part of the ‘law and custom of parliament’ – lex et
consuetudo parliamenti – and, as such, it is for parliament to adjudicate on
matters of privilege, not the courts.1Privileges are embodied in rules of the
Houses of Parliament. The United Kingdom Parliament, however, is not free
to extend existing privileges by a mere resolution of the House: only statutecan create new privileges.
2Privileges derive from practice and tradition; they
are thus customary in origin. Nevertheless, they are recognised as having thestatus of law, being the ‘law and custom of parliament’. Parliament itself can –in the exercise of its sovereign power – place privileges on a statutory basis.For example, in 1770, the Parliamentary Privilege Act withdrew the privilegeof freedom from arrest from servants of Members of Parliament. Further, in1689, Article IX of the Bill of Rights gave statutory recognition to the freedomof speech in parliament. In 1868, parliament ended its own jurisdiction todetermine disputed elections, conferring jurisdiction on the courts by way ofthe Administration of Justice Act. 
The role of the courts
The role of the courts in matters of privilege is confined to determiningwhether a privilege exists, and its scope. If the court rules that a disputedmatter falls within parliamentary privilege the court will decline jurisdiction.This relationship between parliament and the courts may be viewed in twoways. First, it could be viewed as the courts giving recognition to thesupremacy – or sovereignty – of parliament. Historically, parliament wasestablished as the High Court of Parliament, having legislative andjudicial
powers.
3Accordingly, it was appropriate for the ordinary courts of law to
defer to the highest court in the land. Nowadays, this justification is less wellfounded. It is unconvincing to portray parliament, except when exercising itsjudicial function in enforcing and upholding privilege, as a judicial body.
4The
relationship between parliament and the courts may also be explained byreference to the doctrine of the separation of powers. For the judiciary to ruleon the legality of actions of Members of Parliament acting in theirparliamentary capacity or on the actions of the House as a whole would,under current constitutional arrangements, place judges in a potentiallydangerous position, exercising a controlling power over both the legislatureand the executive within it.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Privilege
THE PRINCIPAL PRIVILEGES
The principal individual privileges are freedom of speech in parliament and
freedom of members from arrest in civil matters. The collective privileges ofparliament include the exclusive right to regulate composition and procedure,right of access to the Sovereign, the right to the ‘favourable construction’ bythe Sovereign in relation to its actions. These are formally claimed by theSpeaker, in the form of a Speaker’s Petition to Her Majesty, at the opening ofeach new parliamentary session.
The privileges are substantially the same for both Houses of Parliament
(though see below on the ‘privilege of peerage’). Each House has the sole rightto regulate the privileges it enjoys – although neither House is free to extendits own privileges other than by statute – and, as a result, some minordifferences may be discerned between the two Houses.
Historical overview
Originally designed to protect the right of the King to the services of hisadvisers, the right to freedom from molestation and arrest was establishedearly. By the sixteenth century, parliament itself was assuming jurisdiction toregulate privilege, and privilege was increasingly being used to protect thefledgling parliament from the power of the Crown. Nowadays, while a fewprivileges are principally of historical interest, the majority remain central tothe working of parliament.
Freedom from arrest
The first recorded statement of the right to freedom from arrest dates from1340.
5In 1404, the Commons formally claimed that members were privileged
against arrest ‘for debt, contract, or trespass of any kind according to thecustom of the realm’.
6The King, however, paid little heed and the matter was
not finally resolved. In 1512, Strode, a member of the Commons, wasimprisoned under a court order for proposing certain Bills in parliament.Parliament reacted by passing an Act declaring the proceedings against himvoid, and also that any future proceedings against its members would bevoid.
7In 1627, when King Charles I arrested and detained five knights, his
action was challenged by an application for habeas corpus. The applicationfailed, the court accepting the certificate of the Crown stating that they hadbeen detained by special order of the King: per speciale mandatum regis .

May, 1997, p 74.
6Ibid. 
7Strode’s Case ; see Maitland, 1908.
8Darnel’s Case (the Five Knights’ Case ) (1627).

1629, three members were charged with uttering seditious words in debate
and violence against the Speaker of the House. The Crown contended, and thecourt accepted, that privilege did not attach to seditious words or assault.
9
The Petition of Right 1628 declared the arbitrary power of detention unlawful.In 1640, the Habeas Corpus Act placed protection by writ of habeas corpusfrom the Crown on a statutory basis and, in 1641, the House declared thatarrests of its members were contrary to the law and privilege of parliament.
10
Freedom of speech 
An early example of the Commons protecting its own against the King is thatof Thomas Haxey,
11who, in 1397, laid a Bill before parliament criticising
Richard II. The House of Lords condemned Haxey to die as a traitor, but anArchbishop claimed he was a clerk, thereby giving him the protection of theclergy. He was later pardoned. The Commons subsequently declared that theaction against him was contrary to their privileges. 
Erskine May reports that the first recorded claim of privilege of speech
was contained in the petition of Sir Thomas More in 1523, asking Henry VIII: 
... to take all in good part, interpreting every man’s words, how uncunningly
soever they may be couched, to proceed yeat of a good zeale towards the profitof your Realme. [1997, p 72]
This bold assertion met with no recorded reply, but it is thought that Henry
was generally tolerant of the Commons since he had little to fear from it.Nevertheless, between that time and 1689, freedom of speech in parliamentremained a contended matter. In 1571, Elizabeth I warned the Commons thatthey would ‘do well to meddle with no matters of state but such as should bepropounded unto them, and to occupy themselves in other mattersconcerning the Commonwealth’.
12Elizabeth maintained her grudging
attitude to free speech, reminding the Speaker in 1593 that it was herprerogative not only to summon and dissolve parliament but also to dictatewhat members could discuss.
13James I reasserted the supremacy of the
Monarchy, stating in 1621 that the privileges of the Commons were derivedfrom the ‘grace and permission of our ancestors and us’, and that privilegeswould be respected only to the extent that members acted ‘within their duty’ –as the King saw it. Parliament’s response was to draw up a protestationformally asserting, inter alia , that:
Every Member of the House of Parliament hath, and of right ought to have,
freedom of speech, to propound, treat, reason and bring to conclusion thesame. [Lockyer, 1985, p 226]Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

be imprisoned: Lockyer, 1985, p 190.

Parliamentary Privilege
The King’s reaction was to remove the protestation from the Commons’
Journal and dissolve parliament.
The reign of Charles I (1625–49) was dominated by the struggle between
the King and parliament, culminating in the Civil Wars of 1642–48 and theexecution of Charles I in 1646. The Petition of Right asserted parliament’spower over the King in matters of taxation, imprisonment without good causeand the imposition of martial law. Charles I dissolved parliament in 1629 andruled for 11 years without a parliament.
14
The Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Declaration of Right was finally
to settle the conflicts between parliament and the Crown. The issue of freespeech in parliament was to be resolved by Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689(see, further, below), which conferred absolute protection – or legal immunity– for words spoken by Members of Parliament during the course ofproceedings in parliament.
THE CURRENT SCOPE AND ROLE OF PRIVILEGE
Freedom from arrest
For Members of the House of Commons, the freedom extends for 40 daysbefore the start of and 40 days after the end of the session. For peers, theprivilege protects from arrest in civil matters at all times. The freedom fromarrest does not extend to criminal charges or convictions.
15
Where the criminal law is concerned, there is no immunity, and the re-
arrest of a Member of the House of Commons who had escaped from prison,in the Chamber of the House, was not contrary to privilege.
16In 1939, a
Member of Parliament – Captain Ramsay – was detained under defenceregulations. His detention did not amount to a breach of privilege, although itwould have done so had he been detained for words spoken in parliament.
17
Where a member is arrested on a criminal charge, the Speaker of the
House is notified and in turn will report to the House either orally or inwriting. If a member is detained on grounds of mental illness under theMental Health Act 1983 then – following specialists’ reports to the Speakerconfirming the member’s illness and detention – his seat will be declaredvacant. 
Nowadays, the freedom relates only to civil matters and is generally of
little significance, given that, with one important exception, imprisonment fordebt has been abolished. The exception concerns the availability of

imprisonment as a penalty for the non-payment of financial provision during
marriage, upon divorce, and for children born outside marriage. In 1963, inthe case of Stourton v Stourton (1963), a Member of the House of Lords was
able to escape the sanction of prison for maintenance default by pleadingprivilege. It is anomalous that Members of Parliament should be immunefrom the law in even this limited manner. The Committee on ParliamentaryPrivilege recommended, in 1967, that the freedom be abolished,
18but no
action was taken. 
Freedom of speech and ‘proceedings in parliament’
At the present day, it is more important to notice that this freedom of speechholds good not only against the Crown, but against private individuals also. Amember speaking in either House is quite outside the law of defamation: 
He may accuse any person of the basest crimes, may do so knowing that his
words are false, and yet that person will be unable to take any action againsthim.
19
The most important privilege claimed by parliament is freedom of speech.
Article IX raises a question which has caused much difficulty for the courts.20
It has been seen above that, if a matter falls within the privileges ofparliament, the courts will have no jurisdiction over the matter, other than todetermine whether or not a matter of alleged privilege falls within the ambitof privilege. If a positive determination is made, jurisdiction to rule on thematter falls to parliament and not the courts. In order to make such adetermination in relation to freedom of speech, the courts are obliged tointerpret Article IX of the Bill of Rights, and the phrase ‘proceedings inparliament’.
Some matters are settled. The Bill of Rights makes clear that freedom of
speech in debate is protected from legal action and redress under the law ofdefamation. Debates and questions on the floor of the House and in standingand select committees are therefore clearly protected. Other situations are, orhave been, less straightforward. For example, what is the situation where aMember of Parliament is discussing parliamentary matters outside theprecincts of parliament, or where a Member of Parliament writes to a ministeron such a matter? Moreover, what is the position where a member writes tothe minister or another member with regard to a matter which he wishes toraise in parliament, or which involves allegations made against bodies orpersons outside parliament, on which he requires further information beforeraising the issue in parliament? Despite numerous suggestions for reform toinject greater clarity into the law, many matters remain unclear. The mostrecent consideration of the scope of proceedings in parliament is discussedbelow.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
55418 HC 34 (1967–68), London: HMSO, p xxix. 
19 Maitland, 1908, p 375. On the Defamation Act 1996, see, further, p 561 ff below.20 See Leopold, 1991.

Parliamentary Privilege
The case law is instructive. In Rivlin v Bilainkin (1953), the plaintiff in an
action for defamation had been granted an interim injunction to restrain the
defendant from repeating the alleged defamation. The defendant repeated thedefamatory remarks in letters and took them to the House of Commons,giving one to a messenger to deliver to a Member of Parliament and postingthe other four, addressed to other members, in the House of Commons’ postoffice. In an action for an order committing the defendant for a breach of theinjunction, the defendant argued that publication of the repetition of the libelwas committed within the precincts of the House of Commons and wasaccordingly not actionable in a court of law. Mr Justice McNair declaredhimself: 
... satisfied that no question of privilege arises, for a variety of reasons, and
particularly I rely on the fact that the publication was not connected in anyway with any proceedings in that House ... 
In Duncan Sandys’ case, in 1938, Mr Duncan Sandys had sent to the Secretary
of State for War the draft of a parliamentary question in which he drew
attention to a shortage of military equipment. Within the draft, Mr Sandysquoted figures which, in the view of the War Office, could have been obtainedonly as a result of a breach of the Official Secrets Acts 1911–20. The AttorneyGeneral interviewed Mr Sandys, who later complained that he was beingthreatened with prosecution – in breach of privilege – for failing to disclosethe source of his information. A select committee was established to considerthe relevance of the Official Secrets Acts to members acting in theirparliamentary capacity. The Committee Report considered Article IX of theBill of Rights, and it observed that:
... the privilege is not confined to words spoken in debate or to spoken words,
but extends to all proceedings in Parliament. While the term ‘proceedings inParliament’ has never been construed by the courts, it covers both the asking ofa question and the giving written notice of such question, and includeseverything said or done by a Member in the exercise of his functions as aMember in a committee of either House, as well as everything said or done ineither House in the transaction of parliamentary business.
The Committee went on to assert that:
... words spoken or things done by a Member beyond the walls of Parliamentwill generally not be protected. Cases may, however, easily be imagined ofcommunications between one Member and another, or between a Member anda Minister, so closely related to some matter pending in, or expected to bebrought before, the House, that though they do not take place in the chamberor a committee room they form part of the business of the House, as, forexample, where a Member sends to the Minister the draft of the Question he isthinking of putting down or shows it to another Member with a view toobtaining advice as to the propriety of putting it down or as to the manner inwhich it should be framed ... 
... on the other hand, a casual conversation in the House cannot be said to be a
proceeding in Parliament, and a Member who discloses information in thecourse of such a conversation would not, in their view, be protected byprivilege ...
555

The Committee ruled that if it were necessary, in order to prove the charge
alleged, to produce evidence of what the defendant had said in the House:
... it would be in the power of the House to protect him by withholding
permission for the evidence to be given.21
The response of the House differed markedly in the case of Strauss and the
London Electricity Board in 1958.22At issue was whether or not communication
in written form between an MP and a minister was protected by privilege.
George Strauss MP had forwarded a letter from a constituent to the relevantminister, in which criticism was made of the manner in which the Boarddisposed of scrap metal. The minister passed the letter to the Board forcomment, whereupon the Board threatened to sue Mr Strauss for libel. Themember believed that this was a matter concerned with his parliamentaryduties and that he should be covered by privilege. The Committee ofPrivileges concluded that the letter written was a proceeding in parliamentand that, accordingly, the Board had committed a breach of the privilege ofthe House. The committee was undecided as to whether the ParliamentaryPrivilege Act 1770 (which provides that legal action taken against members isin itself a breach of the privilege of the House) applied. It was recommendedthat the House seek a ruling from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Councilon the matter. The Judicial Committee ruled that the Act referred only to legalaction taken against a member in his private capacity, and not as a result of hisconduct as a Member of Parliament.
23The committee so reported to the
House which, following debate, surprisingly rejected the finding of thecommittee. The London Electricity Board subsequently withdrew its action forlibel, and an independent inquiry set up by the minister exonerated theBoard.
24
The case raises two important questions for consideration. First, a great
many important negotiations and communications take place throughinformal discussion between members outside the precincts of the House.Much of this business is as important as matters raised for formal debate inthe House, yet they are not covered by parliamentary privilege unless soclosely associated to actual or pending proceedings in parliament as to bebrought within that phrase.
Secondly, many of the matters dealt with by Members of Parliament

are not protected by privilege. Where such a matter falls within the
jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner, protection is now afforded bysection 10(5) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, which providesthat such communications are absolutely privileged.
25Uncertainty remains,
however, where it is unclear as to whether or not the matter falls within hisjurisdiction. It is unsatisfactory that neither members of the public, nor ofparliament, are clear as to the potential scope of liability under the law ofdefamation.
Two further cases illustrate the scope of the privilege. R v Rule (1937)
entailed a letter written by a constituent to his Member of Parliamentcomplaining about the conduct of a police officer and a magistrate. In anaction for libel, the court held that, where a communication was one madeunder a duty or common interest, the matter would attract qualified privilege:that is to say, it would be protected from liability unless malice were proven.A similar conclusion was reached in Beach v Freeson (1972), where a Member
of Parliament was sued by a firm of solicitors, concerning whom the memberhad received complaints from a constituent and forwarded the letter, with acovering letter, to the Lord Chancellor and the Law Society. That the letterswere defamatory was not contested, but the court nevertheless held thatpublication of the letters (to the Lord Chancellor and Law Society) wasprotected by qualified privilege on the basis of public interest.
Freedom of speech: its use and misuse
In the Committee of Privileges report of 1986–87,26the Committee had
endorsed the view expressed by the Speaker27that:
We should use our freedom of speech ... with the greatest care, particularly if
we impute any motives or dishonourable conduct to those outside the Housewho have no right of reply.
The Committee recognised that there is ‘no clear dividing line between
statements which represent a legitimate exercise of freedom of speech, on theone hand, and those which constitute an abuse, on the other’ and called onmembers to exercise self-restraint.
In 1955, Kim Philby was named in the House as a Soviet spy, an allegation
which surely would not have been made without the protection of privilege.In the 1960s, the Minister of War’s association with Christine Keeler, who alsohad a relationship with a Soviet Attaché was revealed under the cloak ofprivilege. Also, in the 1960s, a London property racketeer, Peter Rachmann,was identified in the House. In 1980, Jeff Rooker MP made a number of falseaccusations against a Director of Rolls Royce: the allegations were withdrawn

only after the lapse of five weeks. In the 1985–86 session, ministers were
accused in parliament of improper involvement with the Johnson MattheyBank following its collapse. In 1986, Geoffrey Dickins MP accused an Essexdoctor of the sexual abuse of children, following a decision of the Director ofPublic Prosecutions not to prosecute the doctor on the basis that there wasinsufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Which of these exercises offreedom of speech represented a legitimate exercise of the freedom and whichrepresented an abuse is a matter for individual judgment.
The House relies heavily on the notion of the self-restraint of its members,
and is slow to use its disciplinary powers against offending members. TheCommittee on Procedure in its First Report urged members to exercisecaution, and to avoid misusing their freedom. Where members insist on usingprivilege as a protective device and cause damage to the reputations andlivelihoods of citizens, the advice of the Procedure Committee will give littlecomfort.
28Individuals may try to rebut any allegations, may petition
parliament and may try to persuade a Member of Parliament to retract adamaging allegation, but such forms of redress are wholly unsatisfactory incomparison with the right to legal redress.
A Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege issued its First Report in
1999. In relation to members of the public, the Committee considered whethera ‘right of reply’ should be introduced but decided against it. A right of replywould do nothing to prove the truth or falsity of any allegation and nofinancial redress could be made, nor would a statement published in Hansard
attract the same degree of publicity as the offending allegation.
29
The courts and privilege
More recent case law further illustrates the meaning of Article IX and the roleof the courts in relation to matters of privilege. In Rost v Edwards (1990), a
Member of Parliament sued The Guardian newspaper for alleged libel.
30The
Guardian article had stated that the member, who was a member of the Energy
Select Committee and a nominee for selection to the standing committee,considering an Energy Bill, had not registered his interests – as a consultantwith two organisations concerned with energy. Subsequent to publication ofthe article, the member was informed that he was no longer being consideredfor membership of the standing committee and, further, that he had not beengiven the chair of the Energy Select Committee. The member instituted libelChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
55828 Given that ‘advice’ is less compelling than binding rules.
29 In January 2002 it was announced that an application was to be made to the European
Court of Human Rights alleging violations of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention by the
exercise of freedom of speech in parliament and its immunity from suit. Seriousallegations were made by the Foreign Office Minister for Africa against a Belgiandiamond dealer, claiming that there had been trafficking in diamonds in violation ofUnited Nations’ sanctions.

Parliamentary Privilege
proceedings, which were adjourned by the court in order to determine the
issue of parliamentary privilege. The member wished to adduce evidencebefore the court which comprised correspondence between himself and aclerk of the House and the Register of Members’ Interests.
Mr Justice Popplewell ruled that the correspondence could not be
submitted in evidence: that clearly fell within the exclusive domain ofparliament and not the court. As to the Register, the judge took the view thatit was a public document and, accordingly, could be put in evidence. MrJustice Popplewell, recognising the respective jurisdictions of parliament andthe courts, declared that the courts should nevertheless be slow to refuse toadmit in evidence documents which could affect the outcome of legalproceedings and hence individual rights. Rost v Edwards was doubted by the
Privy Council in Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd (1994). In Prebble, a
member of the New Zealand House of Representatives sued the televisioncompany for libel for publishing an article alleging that state assets had beensold off, contrary to stated policy, and that the member had been involved in aconspiracy to effect the sale. In its defence, the company wished to introducein evidence parliamentary papers which substantiated its claim. The memberpleaded privilege. The House of Representatives ruled that it had no power towaive its own privileges and thereby allow the papers to be considered incourt. The Privy Council ruled that to adduce such evidence – without theHouse’s waiver of privilege – contravened privilege and the protection givento parliamentary proceedings under Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689. 
In Pepper v Hart (1993),
31the question considered by the House of Lords
was whether judges may refer to Hansard as an aid to the interpretation of
statutes. This issue has long been one of some controversy, and the orthodoxview has hitherto been that judges may not under any circumstances refer toHansard . In Davis v Johnson (1979), Lord Denning MR stated openly that he
privately referred to Hansard as an aid to interpretation, only to be criticised
for so doing by the House of Lords. However, in Black-Clawson International
Ltd v Papierwerke AG (1975), all five judges in the House of Lords had agreed
that official reports could be consulted to discern the ‘mischief’ with which thelegislation was intended to deal, although their Lordships differed over theextent to which they could be used. Further, in Pickstone v Freeman (1988) ,
three members of the House of Lords made reference to a parliamentaryspeech of the Secretary of State (the other two judges were silent on thismatter). 
In Pepper v Hart (1993), six of the seven judges hearing the case ruled in
favour of admitting parliamentary debates before the court in somecircumstances (the Lord Chancellor dissented on this point). Arguments wereadvanced by the Attorney General against such a decision – not least that, byconsulting parliamentary debates, the courts would be acting contrary to
55931 See Oliver, 1993.

Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689, which prohibits the courts from
questioning proceedings in parliament. The court rejected those views,concluding that there were no constitutional reasons which outweighed themerits of a ‘limited modification’ of the rule. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, givingthe leading judgment of the court, stated that the rule should be relaxedwhere: 
(a) legislation is ambiguous or obscure, or leads to an absurdity;(b) the material relied on consists of one or more statements by a minister or
other promoter of the Bill together, if necessary, with such other
parliamentary material as is necessary to understand such statements andtheir effect; and
(c) the statements relied on are clear.
The House of Lords in Pepper v Hart revealed a marked change in attitude,
although the right to refer to Hansard is not an unqualified right. The
significance of this judgment from the point of view of parliamentary
privilege lies in the court’s consideration of the scope of Article IX of the Bill ofRights 1689. The Attorney General had argued strongly before the court thatfor judges to refer to Hansard infringed Article IX, amounting to an inquiry
into the proceedings in parliament. This submission was rejected by the court,Lord Templeman declaring that reference to Hansard , under limited
circumstances, involved no questioning of parliament, but merely clarificationas to parliament’s intention.
32
In R v Deegan (1998),however,  the Court of Appeal ruled that recourse to
Hansard was not justified. The court below had referred to Hansard in order to
clarify parliament’s intentions as to the meaning of the phrase ‘foldingpocketknife’, the possession of which had led to the appellant’s conviction.The Court of Appeal, however, ruled that the conditions laid down in Pepper v
Hart had not been satisfied, and that for the court to rely on parliamentary
records of debate, on a term which was inherently open to interpretation, wasunjustified. The appeal was dismissed.
The case of Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd (1995) was reconsidered by
the Queen’s Bench Division in Allason v Haines (1995). Joe Haines, a political
journalist, and Mr Richard Stott, editor of Today , applied to have a libel action
brought against them by the plaintiff, Mr Rupert Allason, MP, stayed. Thecourt held that where, in order to defend a libel action, it was necessary tobring evidence of a Member of Parliament’s behaviour in the House ofCommons, and such a defence would be in breach of parliamentary privilege,the action would be stayed, for it would be unjust to deprive the defendants oftheir defence. The defendants had sought to show that Early Day MotionsChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
56032 In Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No 2) and (No 3) (1996),it was held that
references to ministers’ speeches in Hansard may be made not only to construe a
particular statutory provision whose meaning was ambiguous or unclear, but also in a
case where the purpose or object of the statute as a whole is in issue.

Parliamentary Privilege
were inspired to improper motives or were activated upon a failure to take
proper care. Such evidence would be in contravention of Article IX of the Billof Rights 1689. To enforce parliamentary privilege in this case would be tocause injustice to the defendants. A stay was granted.
Rost v Edwards was also critically considered by the Joint Committee on
Parliamentary Privilege which reported in 1999. The report stated baldly that‘we are in no doubt that if this decision is correct, the law should bechanged’.
33In the Committee’s opinion, it is quite wrong for a court of law to
be free to investigate and adjudicate upon matters relating to the Register. Ifthere are allegations of wrongful failure to register, that matter should be ‘amatter for parliament alone’. The Committee recommended that legislation beintroduced to make clear that the Register and matters relating thereto are‘proceedings in parliament’.
The Defamation Act 1996 and Article IX of the Bill of Rights
The Defamation Act 1996 came into being as a result of the Rupert Allasoncase and Neil Hamilton’s intended libel suit against The Guardian newspaper
over its allegations that he had accepted rewards in relation to hisparliamentary duties.
34Section 13 of the Defamation Act provides that a
person may waive, for the purpose of defamation proceedings in which hisconduct in relation to proceedings in parliament is in issue, the protection ofany enactment or rule of law which prevents proceedings in parliament beingimpeached or questioned in any court or place outside parliament. As a result,a Member of Parliament may bring an action for defamation to defend his orher actions, provided that he or she waives the Article IX protection andthereby enables the defence to adduce evidence which otherwise would beexcluded on the basis of privilege. If, however, the Member of Parliament isnot willing to waive the Article IX privilege, then, on the authority of Prebble v
Television New Zealand Ltd, the defamation action may be stayed in order toenable the newspaper to adduce evidence which proves the truth of itsallegation. 
The Hamilton saga continued with Mr Hamilton suing Mohamed Al
Fayed for defamation. Mr Al Fayed sought to have the action struck out onthe basis that, since the Committee on Standards and Privileges and theParliamentary Commissioner for Standards had already investigated theallegation, the trial would breach parliamentary privilege. It was argued thatsection 13 of the Defamation Act 1996 was addressed at the individualprivilege of the member concerned and did not apply to parliament’scollective privilege of exclusive jurisdiction over its internal regulation. Thejudge at first instance refused to strike out the action, as did the Court of
56133 First Report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, 1999, para 123.
34Hamilton v Hencke ; Greer v Hencke (1995), on which see, further, below.

Appeal. On appeal to the House of Lords, the decision of the Court of Appeal
was affirmed. Section 13 applied. Its effect was that the defendant’s waiver ofhis parliamentary protection in relation to the parliamentary inquiry into hisconduct overrode any privilege belonging to parliament as a whole and thusallowed the parties in the libel proceedings to challenge the veracity ofevidence given to the parliamentary committee.
35
First Report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege
(1999)
The 1999 report offered an in depth analysis of the contemporary law and
practice relating to privilege. On the issues raised in Pepper v Hart (1993)36and
related cases, the report endorses the decision, stating that this ‘use ofparliamentary proceedings is benign’.
37The Committee did, however, also
stress that, where the courts depart from accepted practice, that departure‘must be scrutinised thoroughly to see whether as a matter of principle and
practice, it is justified’,
38and that there should be no ‘general weakening of the
prohibition contained in Article IX’.
In similar vein, the Committee considered the use of parliamentary
proceedings made in judicial review proceedings. Accepting the legitimacy ofreference to Hansard in judicial review proceedings, the Committee accepted
that both parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review have an important role toplay in ensuring both democratic and legal control over the executive.Whereas parliament had the sole right to ensure ministerial accountability toparliament, ‘only the courts can set aside an unlawful ministerial decision’.
39
On the circumstances surrounding the Hamilton case, and section 13 of the
Defamation Act 1996 enacted to remedy the defect which flowed from ArticleIX – namely, a plaintiff being unable to pursue his action for defamationbecause the defendant newspaper was prevented, by Article IX, fromjustifying what it had written – the Committee was extremely critical andrecommended reform of the law. Section 13, allowing a Member of Parliamentto waive Article IX, but preventing non-members from doing so, which hadthe effect of making newspapers (and others) unable to establish the truth oftheir allegations, had ‘created indefensible anomalies of its own which shouldnot be allowed to continue’.
40Having reviewed alternatives for reform, the
Committee recommended that the individual member should no longer havethe right to waive the protection of Article IX, and that this right should begiven to the House as a whole, subject to the overriding consideration thatChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Privilege
such waiver was in the interests of justice and would not result in a member
attracting legal liability in a court of law. In considering the mechanism forreaching such a decision, the Committee recommended that, in the House ofLords, the Committee of Privileges always contained four Law Lords and wastherefore the appropriate forum for decision, whereas, in the Commons, itwould be appropriate for such decisions to be reached by the Speaker, assistedwith advice from a small committee of members to include the Leader andShadow Leader of the House with the Attorney General and representativesof the political parties.
41
The composition and procedure of parliament
The Houses of Parliament have an inherent right to regulate their owncomposition and procedure. For example, in Ashby v White (1703), the plaintiff
– a qualified voter – had been denied the right to exercise his vote by theMayor of Aylesbury. The House of Lords awarded Ashby damages. The casegave rise to a significant constitutional conflict between parliament and thecourts. The House of Commons – which at the time had jurisdiction to hearmatters on disputed elections – regarded the decision of the House of Lords asinterfering with the exclusive right of the House of Commons to adjudicate ondisputed elections. Other voters, similarly denied the right to vote, instigatedlegal proceedings and were committed to prison by the House of Commons.They brought an application for habeas corpus to test the legality of theirdetention. In Paty’s Case (1704), in 1704, the court refused the writ of habeas
corpus. Counsel for the applicants, intending to appeal to the House of Lords,was committed to prison. The majority of the court refused to grant theapplication, deferring to the Commons. The dissenting judge, Lord Holt,declared that the courts had the power to decide that a writ of habeas corpuscould effect the release of those detained for contempt by the House ofCommons. In judgment, Lord Holt stated that:
I will suppose, that the bringing of such actions was declared by the House of
Commons to be a breach of their privilege; that that declaration will not makethat a breach of privilege that was not so before. But if they have any suchprivilege, they ought to shew precedent of it. The privileges of the House ofCommons are well known, and are founded upon the law of the land, and arenothing but the law ... And if they declare themselves to have privileges, whichthey have no legal claim to, the people of England will not be estopped by thatdeclaration. This privilege of theirs concerns the liberty of the people in a highdegree, by subjecting them to imprisonment for the infringement of them,which is what the people cannot be subjected to without an Act of Parliament.
In Bradlaugh v Gosset (1884), Bradlaugh had been duly elected as a Member of
Parliament. On arriving to take his seat, Bradlaugh refused to swear the
56341 For other recommendations for reform, see below.

requisite oath on the Bible, offering instead to swear an oath of allegiance to
the Crown. The House of Commons resolved to exclude Bradlaugh from theHouse. The plaintiff sought a declaration from the court that the resolutionwas invalid and an injunction to prevent the House of Commons fromexcluding him. The Court of Queen’s Bench declared that it had nojurisdiction to interfere with a matter concerning the internal regulation ofparliament’s procedures. 
The right of the House to regulate its own procedures is further
demonstrated in the case of the British Railways Board v Pickin (1974). There the
court declined to inquire into the manner of the passage of a Bill even thoughthe plaintiff alleged that he had been denied his right to make representationson a matter adversely affecting his rights in breach of convention. The Courtof Appeal held that the procedure used in relation to a Private – but not Public– Bill could be examined. Lord Denning MR took a bold approach, arguingthat it was for the court to ensure that ‘the procedure of parliament itself is notabused, and that undue advantage is not taken of it. In so doing, the court isnot trespassing on the jurisdiction of parliament itself. It is acting in aid ofparliament and, I might add, in aid of justice.’ The House of Lords disagreedand adopted its traditional stance: the court will not look ‘behind theParliamentary Roll’.
42See, also, the case of Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol
South East (1964), discussed in Chapter 17. There Mr Tony Benn was refused
the right to enter and sit in the Commons, despite being duly elected, becausehe had succeeded to a peerage on the death of his father, Viscount Stansgate.Only by the passage of the Peerage Act 1963 was Tony Benn able to renouncehis peerage and take his seat in the Commons.
On a lighter note, the exclusive rights of the Commons were tested in R v
Campbell ex parte Herbert (1935). Three members of the Kitchen Committee of
the House of Commons were accused of breaching the licensing laws. Theaction failed, the court holding that the House was not governed by theordinary laws relating to licensing, which would only apply if it could beshown that they were expressly intended to apply to Westminster. It is for thisreason that the House remains free to open its bars at any time of day or night.Sir AP Herbert once speculated whether the immunity conceded in R v
Campbell ex parte Herbert could be extended by analogy to permit other
licentious behaviour in the Commons. 
An early conflict between parliament and the courts
In Stockdale v Hansard (1839), a prison inspector made a written report to the
Secretary of State alleging that ‘improper books’ were being circulated inNewgate prison. The report was subsequently published by Hansard , on orderChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
56442 Following, inter alia, Edinburgh and Dalkeith Rly Co v Wauchope (1842); Lee v Bude and
Torrington Junction Rly Co (1871).

Parliamentary Privilege
of the House of Commons. Stockdale, the publisher of the ‘improper book’,
sued Hansard as publishers of the report, which he regarded to be libellous. In
defence, Hansard argued that the publication had been by an order of the
House of Commons and was, accordingly, covered by the privilege of theHouse. The Court of Queen’s Bench ruled that such publication was notcovered by privilege and, moreover, that the House of Commons could not bya resolution deprive the courts of jurisdiction to protect the rights ofindividuals. Stockdale was awarded damages. The Sheriff of Middlesex leviedexecution on Hansard’s property to satisfy the award of damages to Stockdale
and the House of Commons responded by passing a resolution to commit theSheriff for breach of privilege and contempt of parliament. The Sheriff appliedfor a writ of habeas corpus to test the legality of his detention.
43The Sergeant
at Arms produced a certificate from the Speaker stating simply that the Sheriffwas ‘guilty of a contempt and a breach of the privileges of this House’. Thecourt refused to examine the lawfulness of the Sheriff’s detention, stating that,since the Speaker’s warrant did not specify the facts justifying the detention, itwas not for the court to inquire into parliament’s business. Mr JusticeLittledale stated that: 
If the warrant returned be good on the face of it, we can inquire no further. The
principal objection is, that it does not sufficiently express the cause ofcommitment ... If the warrant declares the grounds of adjudication, this Court,in many instances, will examine into their validity; but, if it does not, wecannot get into such an inquiry.
Accordingly, the court conceded jurisdiction to the House of Commons and
rendered itself powerless to provide a remedy for a individual who, acting asan agent for the courts in enforcing the court’s order for damages, foundhimself incarcerated on the order of the Commons. While such an outcomehardly inspires confidence in the judicial system, it nevertheless illustratesclearly the judges’ reluctance to cross the boundary into matters of privilege. 
Breach of privilege and contempt of parliament 
A breach of privilege is conduct offending against one of the known privilegesof parliament. Contempt is a far wider concept than this and has been definedas:
... any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament
in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any Memberor Officer of the House in the discharge of his duty or which has a tendency,directly or indirectly, to produce such results. [Erskine May, 1997, Chapter 9]
The main types of contempts dealt with by the House of Commons, with
illustrations, are listed by Erskine May as being:
56543Sheriff of Middlesex’s Case (1840).

(a) Misconduct in the presence of the House or its committees:
• interrupting the proceedings of a committee;
• a witness persistently misleading a committee.
(b) Disobedience to rules or orders of the House or its committees:
• refusal to attend as a witness;• refusing an order to withdraw from the House.
(c) Presenting a forged or falsified document to the House or its committees:
• forging signatures to petitions.
(d) Misconduct by Members or officers as such:
• deliberately misleading the House;• corruption by acceptance of bribes.
(e) Constructive contempts:
• speeches or writing reflecting on the House;• wilful misrepresentation of debates;• premature disclosure of committee proceedings of evidence;• other indignities offered to the House, such as fighting in the lobbies,
using the badge and the name of the House in connection with anunofficial publication; and serving a writ on a Member in the precincts,while the House was sitting, without leave of the House.
(f) Obstructing Members in the discharge of their duty:
• molesting or insulting Members attending, coming to, or going from
the House;
• attempted intimidation of Members, including publishing threatening
posters regarding Members voting in a forthcoming debate andthreatening to stop public investment in a Member’s constituency ifthat Member persisted in making speeches of the kind he had made ina recent debate;
• molesting Members on account of their conduct in parliament, for
example, by inciting newspaper readers to telephone a Member to
complain of a question he had tabled;
• speeches or writings reflecting on Members’ conduct in the House, for
example, accusing the Speaker of partiality in the Chair.
(g) Obstructing officers of the House while in the execution of their duty:
• resisting the Serjeant at Arms when enforcing an order of the House.
(h) Obstructing witnesses:
• calling a person to account or censuring him for evidence given by him
to a committee of the House.
The 1999 Report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege
recommended that contempt of parliament be defined in statute as part of itsproposal for a new Parliamentary Privileges Act and an accompanyingcode.
44Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Privilege
MEMBERS’ INTERESTS AND MEMBERS’ INDEPENDENCE
Freedom from interference in parliament’s work is a foundational principle of
privilege. Accordingly, it is essential that all Members of Parliament are underno external pressure which could pose an actual or potential threat to theirindependence. However, from a constitutional standpoint, this issuerepresents one of the most troublesome aspects of privilege. This remains atopic of much contemporary significance and is one which raises difficultquestions. In 1994, this issue came to the fore and, as a result of a number ofallegations concerning members’ interests – on which, see further below – aninquiry headed by Lord Justice Nolan was established by the Prime Ministerto examine the issue.
45The findings of the inquiry are discussed below. 
A majority of members of the House of Commons are in paid employment
in addition to being salaried members of the House.46Many members are also
sponsored by outside bodies who contribute to their election expenses andmay contribute towards the cost of secretarial and/or research staff employedby a member.
47It may be argued as a point of principle that members of
Parliament should not receive any financial or other assistance from anyoutside party, whether a company or a trades union, since the very fact ofreceipt of such support potentially undermines the independence andintegrity of the recipient.
48This is not, however, the view adopted by the
House of Commons itself although, from time to time, the House is troubledby such issues. The traditionally accepted view is that such sponsorship orremuneration is perfectly proper, provided that it does not impede themember’s independence in the actual exercise of his parliamentary duties. 
However, there is a fine line to be drawn between legitimate payments to
members and payments designed to impede a member’s independence,which may amount to bribery and corruption. 
Rules regulating members’ interests
In 1695, by a resolution of the House, the ‘offer of money or other advantage’to a Member of Parliament for the purpose of persuading him or her topromote any matter in parliament was ruled to be ‘a high crime andmisdemeanour’. Further, in 1858, a resolution declared it to be ‘improper forany member to promote any matter’ in relation to which he or she hadreceived a financial reward.
49Specifically in relation to the asking of
parliamentary questions, the Committee of Privileges in 1945 ruled that it was

46 Non-ministerial salaries have only been payable since 1911. For the background, see
Erskine May, 1997, Chapter 1.
47 The trade unions have a statutory right to sponsor Members of Parliament from
separate political funds (Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992).

News , 20 April 1995).

a breach of the privileges of the House to ‘offer money or other advantage’ to
induce members to take up questions with ministers.50Members of
Parliament found guilty of corruption may be expelled from the House.51
When speaking in debate or in any proceedings in the House or its
committees, or when communicating with other members or ministers, aresolution of 1974 requires that members shall disclose ‘any relevantpecuniary interest or benefit ... whether direct or indirect, that he may havehad, may have or may be expecting to have’.
52
In 1947, the Committee of Privileges had the opportunity to examine the
issue of contracts made between members and outside bodies. Mr WJ Brownwas elected the Member for Rugby in 1942. He had previously held the post ofGeneral Secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association and, following hiselection, agreed to become its Parliamentary General Secretary. Followingdisagreements between Mr Brown and the Association, it was resolved thatMr Brown’s appointment should be terminated. The matter was raised in theCommons, the argument being advanced that the Association’s threat toterminate Mr Brown’s contract was calculated to influence the member in theexercise of his parliamentary duties and, accordingly, amounted to a breach ofprivilege. The committee reported that:
It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely
calculated to affect the Member’s course of action in Parliament, but is of akind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should beprotected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently andwithout fear of punishment or hope of reward.
On the facts of the case, the Committee ruled that the making of such
payments in itself did not involve any breach of privilege, and that:
On the other hand, your committee regard it as an inevitable corollary that if
an outside body may properly enter into contractual relationships with andmake payments to a Member as such, it must in general be entitled toterminate that relationship if it lawfully can where it considers it necessary forthe protection of its own interest so to do. What, on the other hand, an outsidebody is certainly not entitled to do is to use the agreement or the payment asan instrument by which it controls, or seeks to control the conduct of aMember or to punish him for what he has done as a Member.
53
A further instance of alleged improper pressure being brought to bear on
Members of Parliament occurred in 1975. The Yorkshire Area Council of theNational Union of Mineworkers who sponsored a number of LabourMembers of Parliament, resolved that it would withdraw its sponsorship fromany member who voted in the House in a manner which conflicted withUnion policy.

contempt of the House, amounting as it did to an attempt to force a member
to vote in a particular way thus threatening a member’s freedom of speech.54
In the event, the National Executive of the Union nullified the resolution andno action was taken against the Union.
In June 2002 it was reported that the Rail Maritime and Transport Union
(RMT), which sponsors 13 Labour Members, had proposed an oath of loyaltyto be signed by its sponsored MPs or face the loss of sponsorship, which isworth more than £40,000 a year to the constituency parties. John Prescott,Deputy Prime Minister, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons andTam Dalyell, the longest serving MP in the Commons, are among those whowill lose the support of the Union. The matter is being referred to the Speakerrequesting that the matter be referred to the Commons Standards andPrivileges Committee on charges of attempting to influence MPs and showingcontempt for the independence of parliament.
The Register of Members’ Interests
On the wider question of the financial interests of Members of Parliament,under the rules of the House, all members are required to declare theirinterests, these being recorded in the Register of Members’ Interests. Aresolution of the House of Commons provided that:
... in any debate or proceeding of the House or its committees or transactions or
communications which a Member may have with other Members or withMinisters or servants of the Crown, he shall disclose any relevant pecuniaryinterest or benefit of whatever nature, whether direct or indirect, that he mayhave had, may have or may be expecting to have. [22 May 1974]
The practice was considered by the Select Committee on Members’ Interests in
1968–69 and 1969–70. On the relevance of interests, the Committee reportedthat:
The judgment on whether an interest is relevant and should be declared is in
the first instance a matter for the Member concerned ... The main criterion fordeclaration should be relevant to debate or other activity in which a Member istaking part. An interest should be declared whenever a specific and relevantfinancial connection exists which might reasonably be thought to affect theexpression of a Member’s views on the matter under debate or other activity ...If the interest is not relevant there is no need to declare it. Nor need an interestbe declared which does not entail an actual or potential benefit.
55
The Register of Members’ Interests is published annually.56The following
classes of interests are required to be registered:57

57 1995 revised Register.

(a) remunerated directorships of companies, public or private;
(b) remunerated employments, trades, professions, offices or vocations;
(c) the names and details of clients of a lobbying company in relation to which
a Member plays a parliamentary role;
(d) gifts, benefits or hospitality received. Sums in excess of £125 cash or
material benefit must be registered, as must hospitality over £160;
(e) financial sponsorships either as a parliamentary candidate where, to the
knowledge of the Member, the sponsorship in any case exceeds 25 per cent
of the candidate’s election expenses; or as a Member of Parliament, by anyperson or organisation, stating whether any such sponsorship includes anypayment to the Member or any material benefit or advantage, direct orindirect, such as the services of a research assistant;
(f) overseas visits, relating to or arising out of membership of the House,
where the cost of any such visit has not been borne wholly by the Memberor by public funds;
(g) any payments or any material benefits or advantages received from or on
behalf of foreign governments, organisations or persons;
(h) land or property of substantial value (excluding a Member’s home) or
from which a substantial income is derived;
(i) names of companies or other bodies in which a Member has, to his
knowledge, either himself or with or on behalf of his spouse or infantchildren, a beneficial interest in share holdings of a nominal value greaterthan one hundredth of the issued share capital;
(j) miscellaneous and unremunerated interests. Registration of such interests
is voluntary.
58
The rules relating to ministers are more strict than those relating to ordinary
Members of Parliament.59Ministers are required to resign directorships in all
companies other than those dealing with family estates, to divest themselvesof any investments which might involve a conflict of interest with theirministerial position and to avoid speculative investments which might be seento be made with the benefit of information acquired as a result of theirministerial office. A minister may only continue to act as a Member of Lloyd’swith Prime Ministerial permission.
60
Failure to register an interest may be regarded as a contempt of the House.
The only member who consistently refused to enter any interests on theRegister was Mr Enoch Powell. Mr Powell adopted the constitutional stancethat, since only statute could impose legal duties on individuals, the Housecould not – through the use of resolutions – lawfully require him to register.The select committee, having tried persuasion and inviting the House to takeaction to enforce the duty to register, took no further action. 
The seriousness with which the House regards matters of interests which
come to its attention may be seen in the case of Mr Michael Mates, a seniorChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

60Ibid, paras 118–23. See, further, Chapter 11 on the issue of ministerial conduct.

Parliamentary Privilege
Conservative Party member. Mr Mates was chairman of the Select Committee
on Defence, which was considering low flying exercises by the airforce, whichentailed consideration of the use of flight simulation equipment. Mr DaleCampbell-Savours MP complained to the select committee that Mr Mates hadfailed properly to register and declare certain financial interests in the defenceindustry. Mr Mates had financial interests in a defence consultancy business,and in a manufacturer of flight simulation equipment, for whom Mr Matesacted as general adviser. It was not disputed that Mr Mates had never spokenon behalf of either company in the House or in committee, and there was noallegation that Mr Mates had used his parliamentary position to further theinterests of either company.
Mr Mates’s defence was that his interests had no relevance to the
deliberations of the committee and that, in any event, the interests appearance
on the Register of Members’ Interests ensured that members of the selectcommittee were fully aware of his interests. The select committee was highlycritical of Mr Mates’s conduct, asserting that ‘we do not believe that MrMates’s judgement was sound on this point’.
61
The committee took the view that Mr Mates was in error in not declaring
his interests when asking, as Chairman of the Defence Select Committee,questions relating to flight simulators. It was accepted that Mr Mates hadmade no personal gain nor had he made any effort to conceal his interests.Nevertheless, his conduct fell below the high standard of disclosure expectedby the select committee. In the event, the committee decided not to ask theHouse to take any action, but recommended that all members of Parliamenttake serious note of the findings in the report.
Cash for questions62
The cash for questions affair began in 1993, when political lobbyist Ian Greeradvised Mohamed Al Fayed to bribe Members of Parliament to pursue hisinterests in parliament. In 1994, Al Fayed publicly claimed that Tory MPswere paid to plant questions. The Guardian newspaper pursued the story,
leading to a libel action by Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer. That action wasdropped when it became apparent that The Guardian had damning evidence
which would cause the action to fail.
63
In 1994, a number of allegations were made against Members of
Parliament in relation to accepting money for the tabling of parliamentaryquestions to ministers. Allegations were also made in relation to improperpayments being accepted by members from outsiders, in the form of paymentfor hotel bills. Further, allegations were made in respect of the failure of anumber of Members of Parliament who allegedly failed to record benefits

received and other relationships in which members received financial reward
for services in the Register of Members’ Interests. 
In 1994, two Parliamentary Private Secretaries resigned (from the
government but not from parliament) following allegations into the receipt ofmoney in exchange for tabling parliamentary questions. Furthermore, in 1994,two Junior Ministers faced allegations that they received payments and/orgifts in exchange for tabling parliamentary questions. On 20 October 1994, The
Guardian alleged that Tim Smith MP and Neil Hamilton MP had each received
£2,000 for tabling questions in parliament concerning the takeover of Harrodsby the Al Fayed brothers. Tim Smith resigned on the day of the report. NeilHamilton remained in office, claiming that he enjoyed the continued supportof the Prime Minister. On 21 October, however, The Guardian newspaper
published details of a bill from the Ritz Hotel in Paris, totalling an estimated£4,000, paid for by Mr Al Fayed. The then Prime Minister subsequentlydemanded Mr Hamilton’s resignation.
The matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges. The rapidly
accelerating and intensifying atmosphere of suspected corruption – or ‘sleaze’– in public life caused the Prime Minister to appoint a judicial inquiry intostandards of conduct in public life.
64
The cash for questions affair also raises issues concerning the press.
Journalists from The Sunday Times , working undercover, offered payment of
£1,000 to two Conservative Parliamentary Private Secretaries, GrahamRiddick and David Tredinnick. The offers were made by telephone and theconversations recorded by the journalists. The Committee of Privilegesinquired into the allegations in July 1994 and, in April 1995, recommendedthat the two members be suspended from parliament for 20 days and ten daysrespectively for conduct which ‘fell below the standards of the House’. InApril 1995, the House, following debate, adopted the committee’srecommendation. The members also lost their parliamentary salaries for theperiods of suspension. Concerning the role of The Sunday Times, the committee
was highly critical of the manner in which their investigation was conducted,but no action has been taken against the newspaper. 
The Committee on Standards in Public Life: the Nolan Inquiry
The Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Lord Nolan, wasestablished as a standing body, with membership being held for three years.The Committee’s terms of reference are:
To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of
public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercialactivities, and to make recommendations as to any changes in presentarrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards ofprobity in public life.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
57264 Committee on Standards in Public Life.

Parliamentary Privilege
For these purposes, public life should include Ministers, civil servants and
advisers, Members of Parliament and United Kingdom Members of theEuropean Parliament, members and senior officers of all non-departmentalpublic bodies and of national health service bodies, non-ministerial officeholders, members and other senior officers of other bodies dischargingpublicly funded function, and elected members and senior officers of localauthorities.
Individual allegations of impropriety do not fall within the committee’s terms
of reference.
The Committee has investigated and reported on three matters: issues
relating to Members of Parliament; issues relating to ministers and civilservants; and issues relating to non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs orquangos).
65In this chapter, the findings relating to Members of Parliament are
discussed. The conduct of ministers and civil servants is considered inChapter 11.
In May 1995, the committee published its First Report.
66While finding
that, in general, ‘there is no evidence ... of a growth in actual corruption’(paragraph 6), the committee records a widespread loss of public confidencein the probity of Members of Parliament. Evidence to the committee revealedthat 64 per cent of the public believed that Members of Parliament mademoney by using their office improperly, a figure which had risen from 46 percent in 1984.
67
The committee set out the general principles of conduct which apply to
public life as being selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness,honesty and leadership. 
Members of Parliament
The Nolan Report recorded that the 1995 Register of Members’ Interestssuggest that 26 members had entered into agreements with public relations orlobbying firms. A further 142 members had consultancies ‘with other types ofcompany or with trade associations’. The 168 members between them held atotal of 356 consultancies. When ministers and the Speaker are excluded fromthe analysis, almost 30 per cent of Members of Parliament held some form ofconsultancy agreement. In relation to associations with trades unions, a totalof 184 members had sponsorship agreements, 27 had paid consultancies, anda further ten received some form of financial assistance from trade unions.Accordingly, the committee concluded that almost 70 per cent of Members ofParliament (excluding ministers and the Speaker) had some form of financialrelationship with outside bodies.

66 Nolan Report.
67 Professor Ivor Crewe citing a Gallup survey.

Despite the evidence of witnesses and persons writing to the committee,
the committee did not conclude from this evidence that such arrangements
should be banned. Indeed, the involvement of Members of Parliament inoutside work was regarded by the committee as a benefit to parliament as awhole. As the committee viewed the matter: 
... a Parliament composed entirely of full time professional politicians would
not serve the best interests of democracy. The House needs if possible tocontain people with a wide range of current experience which can contributeto its expertise. [paragraph 19]
The committee was also concerned that a ban on outside financial interests
would act as a deterrent to people who would otherwise stand for election toparliament. The committee recommended, therefore, that Members ofParliament should continue to have the right to engage in outsideemployment. The matter which remained was how best to protect theintegrity of members and the House as a whole in light of such continuingoutside employment. 
Having reviewed the early resolutions of the House, and the later
resolution of 1947,
68and the rules regulating the registration of members’
interests, the committee found that the Register had worked unsatisfactorily.The committee invited the House of Commons to review the statement ofprinciple which governed the registration of interests.
Paid consultancies
Three fifths of all members of the House have arrangements with clients orsponsors. While appreciating that paid consultancies enable ‘many entirelyrespectable, and in some cases highly deserving, organisations’ to ‘gain avoice in the nation’s affairs’,
69the Committee recognised that there was a fine
– and difficult – line to be drawn between paid advice and paid advocacy, thelatter of which is a matter of concern. To remove the right to engage in sucharrangements would be ‘impracticable’ and was, accordingly, notrecommended. There was, however, one area – the issue of ‘generalconsultancies’ – in which the committee wanted to see firm and immediateaction.
General consultancies
Public relations and lobbying firms are engaged in acting as advisers andadvocates to a wide range of clients, each of which is pursuing its ownobjective in terms of exerting pressure on parliament. The problem posed bysuch companies is that registration of an agreement with the company doesnot necessarily disclose the actual client for whom, in fact, the member isacting in a parliamentary capacity. The committee recommended that there beChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
57468 See the case of Mr Brown, discussed above, p 568.
69 Nolan Report , para 46.

Parliamentary Privilege
an immediate ban introduced on such relationships, but parliament did not
act specifically on this proposal but, rather, tightened the rules relating toregistration and the declaration of interests.
Clarifying the Register of Members’ Interests
The committee acknowledged that the 1995 Register was an improvement onprevious Registers. However, there still remained areas of doubt anduncertainty as to the precise requirements of disclosure of interests, and anunacceptable degree of laxity in the enforcement of registration. Thecommittee recommended that the entry requirements be clarified. Since thebeginning of the 1995 session, members have been required to deposit in fullany contracts which involve the member acting in a parliamentary capacity onbehalf of any organisation, and these contracts are available for publicinspection. In addition, members are required to reveal their annualremuneration, and also estimated monetary benefits received of any kind.Furthermore, all agreements which do not involve the member acting in aparliamentary capacity for an organisation and, therefore, do not need to bedeposited, should contain clear terms stating that the agreement does notinvolve the member acting for the organisation in a parliamentary capacity.
70
The committee also emphasised the requirement that members of
Parliament disclose their interests on ‘each and every occasion when amember approaches other members or ministers on a subject where afinancial interest exists’.
71The onus is on the members to disclose the interest,
and he or she should not assume that the interest is one known about by theother party.
72
The rules on conflicts of interest should be further developed, and
clarification provided on the circumstances under which a member ofParliament should withdraw from, or refrain from taking part in, proceedingsin parliament.
Gifts and hospitality
In relation to gifts and hospitality, the committee found that the rules set outin Questions of Procedure for Ministers
73are sufficiently detailed and that no
further elaboration is required. The committee endorsed the importantprinciple set out in Questions of Procedure:
It is a well established and recognised rule that no Minister or public servant
should accept gifts, hospitality or services from anyone which would, or mightappear to, place him or her under an obligation.

Enforcing members’ obligations
The Nolan Committee considered that Members of Parliament are
insufficiently aware of the binding nature of resolutions of the House, andthat this climate of laxity is one of the contributory factors to poor compliance.Furthermore, the committee regarded the respective roles of the SelectCommittee on Members’ Interests and the Committee of Privileges of theHouse as unclear. The committee proposed the appointment of anindependent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, responsible formaintaining the Register of Members’ Interests and for providing guidance onstandards of ‘conduct, propriety and ethics’. The Commissioner fulfils asimilar function to that of the Comptroller and Auditor General and theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
75The Commissioner has
power to receive and investigate complaints concerning members’ conduct. 
Political reaction to the Nolan Report was mixed. In a six hour debate on
the Nolan Report in May 1995, some curious alliances between right wing andleft wing politicians of both the Conservative Party and Labour Party wereformed to oppose the recommendations. Many Conservative Membersopposed, in particular, the introduction of a Commissioner. The former PrimeMinister, Edward Heath, attacked the proposal on the basis that aCommissioner would be a parliamentary ‘outsider’ unable to detect poorstandards of conduct in the House. A former senior Conservative Member ofParliament, Enoch Powell,
76warned that questions of members’ conduct
cannot be legislated for.
The First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (the ‘Nolan
Report’) was published in July 1995.77The Report recommended the
following:
(a) that all new Members of Parliament should undertake a training course in
ethics;
(b) that there should be established the office of Commissioner for Standards –
an ethics ombudsman – to investigate allegations of breaches of the rules.
The Commissioner for Standards would be responsible solely to the Houseof Commons, and should not enjoy independent legal status – asrecommended by the Nolan Inquiry – similar to that enjoyed by theComptroller and Auditor General and the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration. The Commissioner will investigate allegations andrecommend whether the matter should be heard by the Select Committeeon Standards and Privileges;
(c) the Committee on Standards and Privileges will replace the current
Privileges Committee of the House;Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
57675 See Chapters 16 and 26, respectively.

Parliamentary Privilege
(d) Members of Parliament against whom allegations have been made should
be entitled to legal representation;
(e) Members of Parliament are to be required to declare financial interests
when tabling parliamentary questions.
The proposal that Members of Parliament should be forbidden from working
for multi-client lobbying companies is also subject to further consideration.
Members of the House of Commons were given a free vote (a vote free
from any party-political pressure) on the recommendations. Following anacrimonious Commons’ debate, the proposal that Members of Parliamentshould declare the size of their outside earnings was rejected by 282 votes to248 votes.
78
In relation to ministers, the Nolan Report was critical of the present
position, whereby ministers may leave government office and assume seniorpositions with – in particular – companies which have recently beenprivatised by the government.
In response to aspects of the Nolan Report, the House approved a Code of
Conduct, incorporating the key principles of conduct in public life .
79Ministers
leaving office will no longer be permitted to take employment in the privatesector without the appointment being vetted by an independent committee.From the parliamentary session 1995–96, all Cabinet Ministers have to wait atleast three months before taking outside paid employment. In addition, a twoyear waiting period may be imposed. In relation to appointments to non-governmental public bodies, a Commissioner for Public Appointments hasbeen established to ensure that there is no political bias in such appointments.
The House of Commons, in response to the Nolan Report, passed
resolutions which (a) introduce a rule against paid advocacy and (b) requiremembers entering into agreements for the provision of services in theircapacity of members to deposit the terms of their agreements with theParliamentary Commissioner for Standards at the same time as they areregistered in the Register of Members’ Interests. Furthermore, the Houseresolved to revise the 1947 resolution by inserting the requirement that noMember of Parliament (nor member of his or her family) shall receiveremuneration of any kind in relation to raising an issue in parliament bymeans of any speech, question, motion, introduction of a Bill or amendment toa motion or Bill. In addition, the House resolved that the rules on declarationof interests be amended to make it clear that members are required to declareany relevant interest when tabling questions for oral or written answer orwhen preparing amendments to a Bill. Further, a Committee on Standardsand Privileges was established; and the office of Parliamentary Commissionerfor Standards.
57778 (1995) The Times , 20 July. 
79 HC 688 (1995–96).

The Committee on Standards and Privileges’ first investigation concerned
allegations that David Willetts, the Paymaster General, attempted to influence
a 1994 investigation into whether Neil Hamilton had broken House ofCommons rules. A finding that he had tried improperly to influence aninquiry could have lead to a reprimand or suspension or expulsion from theHouse of Commons. Any recommendation for action made by the committeemust be approved by the House of Commons. In December 1996, it wasreported that Mr Willetts was to be rebuked by the committee and that hewould apologise, but that no further action would be taken. As a result of thecommittee’s report, Mr Willetts resigned from office.
80
The Report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards (the ‘Downey
Report’) was published in July 1997. The 898 page report, which had taken tenmonths to complete, made it clear that the five former ministers and Membersof Parliament involved in accusations of accepting financial rewards, whichwere not recorded as required in the Register of Members’ Interests, and weredenied by the MPs, were guilty of breaking the parliamentary rules.
81The
Downey Report found the evidence against Neil Hamilton, who continues todeclare his innocence, ‘compelling’:
The evidence that Mr Hamilton received cash payments from Mr Al Fayed in
return for lobbying services is compelling: and I so conclude.
The insistence that parliament remain a self-regulatory body has come under
question in light of the Downey Report. While early analyses of the DowneyReport all praised the painstakingly detailed approach of the Commissioner,there were suggestions that such allegations should perhaps be investigatedby a statutory tribunal, headed by a judge, and holding public, rather thanprivate, hearings.
82The ability of parliament to remain a self-regulatory body
was thrown into further doubt by the circumstances surrounding thedeparture of the Commissioner for Standards, Elizabeth Filkin, who – havingbeen told that she would not be automatically reappointed for a further termof office and would need to reapply through open competition – announcedher decision to depart. Her investigations into allegations, inter alia, against a
former trade secretary, former Foreign Office minister, Northern IrelandSecretary and the Deputy Prime Minister provoked a storm of protest amongMembers of Parliament, and her findings failed to be upheld fully by theCommittee for Standards and Privileges. At root, the problem appeared to beChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
57880 (1996) The Times , 11 and 12 December. Allegations concerning the current Paymaster
General, Geoffrey Robinson, have been referred to the Commissioner on Standards. It is
alleged that the Paymaster General failed to register interests relating to hischairmanship of a machine tools company between 1983 and 1987: (1998) The Times , 26
February. The Commissioner cleared Robinson of any breach of the rules.

Parliamentary Privilege
that the Commissioner was too rigorous in her enquiries. The Commissioner
accused ministers, MPs and civil servants of undermining her position.83
Penalties for breach of privilege and contempt
Historically, the most important power available to the House was to committhe offender to prison. Erskine May describes this power as the ‘keystone ofparliamentary privilege’, but it is little used and has not been used sinceBradlaugh’s Case in 1880. The House can vote to allow the offender to be
prosecuted by the police, as happened in 1970, when a stranger threw a CSgas canister into the Chamber.
84The most regularly employed sanction is the
reprimand. The reprimand was used against Mr Tam Dalyell in 1968.85The
House may order that a member be suspended from the House or expelled. In1948, Garry Allighan MP was found to have lied to a committee, falselyaccusing other members of taking money. The House ordered his expulsionfrom parliament.
86In 1988, Ron Brown MP was suspended from the House
for the contempt of damaging the Mace. In 1994, the House suspended twomembers, with loss of salary, for 20 days and ten days respectively, foraccepting payment for putting down parliamentary questions (see, further,below). Following a report from the Standards and Privileges Committee,
87a
Member of Parliament, the Member for Liverpool (Mr Wareing) was alsosuspended for failing to register a shareholding interest in the Register ofMembers’ Interests. The House of Commons has also considered the reportsof the Standards and Privileges Committee
88in relation to 25 investigations of
allegations of breach of the rules. The committee had upheld findings onallegations in relation to 25 members and former members made by theParliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Allegations were proved againstfive members, but all had failed to be re-elected in the 1997 general election.Each would, but for their failure to be re-elected to parliament, have facedsuspension. 
The House of Lords has the power to impose fines on offenders but,
curiously, the House of Commons does not have that power although,historically, it did. The last occasion on which a fine was imposed was in
57983 The post of Commissioner in future is to be more part-time and at a lower rate of pay.
In R v Commissioner for Standards and Privileges ex parte Al Fayed (1998) the Court of
Appeal ruled that the court had no jurisdiction to review decisions of the
Commissioner, on the basis that the Commissioner was concerned with activities withinparliament, and the Commissioner was accountable to the special standing committeein the House of Commons, which alone had the power to perform supervisoryfunctions over the Commissioner.

1666.89The power to impose fines was denied in R v Mead (1762).
Recommendations of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1967
and 1977 that such a power be introduced by statute have not beenimplemented. Where newspapers breach the rules of privilege or commitcontempt of parliament, the editor may be called to the bar of the House toexplain and apologise, and journalists may be excluded from the precincts ofthe House for a specified period.
With regard to maintaining order in the House, the Speaker has a range of
available disciplinary powers. The Speaker will firstly warn a member abouthis conduct. If this does not ensure order, the Speaker may request themember to leave the Chamber. If the member refuses to leave, the Speakermay direct him to withdraw
90immediately, and the member must leave the
precincts of parliament for the remainder of the day. In the rare event that amember refuses to comply with the order to withdraw, the Speaker mayformally ‘name’ the member
91and put down a motion that the member be
suspended from the service of the House. The suspension on a first offencewill last for five sitting days, on a second occasion, for 20 sitting days and onany subsequent occasion, for as long as the House shall determine.
The Select Committee on Procedure,
92which in 1988 considered the
standard of conduct of members, found a sharp increase in the use of theSpeaker’s formal disciplinary powers, in particular the number of namings.The parliament of 1979–83 saw 12 cases, of which five involved naming, the1983–87 parliament saw nine cases, including five namings, but, in the1988–89 session, nine cases occurred, eight of which led to namings. Thecommittee recommended that everything possible should be done to maintainorder in the House. The House of Commons is, however, powerless in relationto the punishment of former Members of Parliament in respect of breaches ofprivilege while Members. 
The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege Report of 1999 had
considered in depth the issue of bribery of a Member of Parliament,subsequent to the Law Commission’s investigation into the law relating tobribery and corruption.
93Four options exist. The first is to rely solely on
parliamentary privilege to deal with allegations of bribery; the second, tosubject Members of Parliament to the same corruption laws as other people;the third, to distinguish between conduct to be dealt with by parliament andthat to be dealt with under the criminal law; and the fourth, to make criminalproceedings against members subject to the approval of the relevant House ofChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliament. Each of these, in the Committee’s view, was attended by
difficulties in relation to parliamentary privilege and Article IX. Nevertheless,the Committee favoured the second option – namely, bringing members ofboth Houses of Parliament within the ambit of the criminal law of bribery. Thenecessary legislation would need to be drafted to make clear that evidencerelating to an alleged offence would be admissible in a court of lawnotwithstanding Article IX. 
In 2000, the Committee on Standards in Public Life made
recommendations designed to improve discipline over Members ofParliament. In Reinforcing Standards, Lord Neill of Bladen recommended that
legislation be introduced to bring Members of Parliament, and those whooffered bribes to members, within the reach of bribery laws. The report alsorecommended that there should be an appeal mechanism against findings ofmisconduct by the Committee on Standards and Privileges. Seriousallegations of misconduct would be heard by a new tribunal, chaired by anindependent legal expert and senior backbenchers, rather than the Standardsand Privileges Committee. Before a case is referred to the tribunal, it would beconsidered by the Committee on Standards and Privileges and the accusedmember would be able to make representations to the Committee. Financialassistance would be made available to fund legal representation before thetribunal. The tribunal’s findings would be reported back to the Committeewhich would decide what penalty should be recommended to the House ofCommons. The Neill Committee also recommended that an appealsprocedure should be introduced to enable a member to appeal against thedecision to refer his or her case to the tribunal, and against the tribunal ruling.The appeal would be heard by a retired senior judge. Proceedings before theCommittee should be held in public. 
The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament
The Code of Conduct sets out the general principles to guide members on
standards of conduct that the House and the public have a right to expect,together with a Guide to the Rules relating to the Conduct of Members .
94These
include matters relating to the registration of interests and their declarationand the advocacy rule (see, further, below). In relation to registration, intereststo be registered are directorships; remunerated employment; sponsorshipswhich amount to 25 per cent or more of election expenses, or other fundsrelated to a candidate’s election campaign; free or subsidised researchassistance; gifts, benefits or hospitality; overseas visits; overseas gifts andbenefits; land and property; shareholdings; and miscellaneous interests.Where members have entered into agreements which are relevant to theirparliamentary duties, these are to be deposited with the Parliamentary

Commissioner for Standards in addition to being registered. Where an
informal, unwritten agreement, has been entered into, it must also bedeposited with the Commissioner in written form. In relation to paidadvocacy, this is banned in relation to a number of important matters. Inparticular, paid advocacy is banned in relation to initiating parliamentaryproceedings, including the presentation of Bills, presentation of petitions, theasking of parliamentary questions, tabling or moving motions, or movingamendments to Bills. Any Member of Parliament, or member of the public,may lay a complaint, alleging breach of the Code, with the Commissioner forinvestigation. The Commissioner has a discretion whether or not toinvestigate. It is this tightening of the rules which has led to recentinvestigations into allegations including the Prime Minister, Deputy PrimeMinister, Paymaster General and Leader of the Liberal Democrat Party,discussed in Chapter 11. The Commissioner reports his findings to the SelectCommittee on Standards and Privileges, which examines the findings. If noprima facie case is disclosed, this is reported to the Commons. If there is a prima
facie case disclosed, the committee, following its examination, will report to
the Commons, detailing its findings. The final decision on the matter lies withthe House of Commons. 
Subsequent to the cash for questions affair, the House of Commons re-stated
the resolution of 1947
95and added the following:
... in particular, no Member shall, in consideration of any remuneration, fee,
payment, reward or benefit in kind, direct or indirect ...
(a) advocate or initiate any cause or matter on behalf of any outside body or
individual; or
(b) urge any other Member of either House ... including Ministers, to do so, by
means of any speech, question, motion, introduction of a Bill or
amendment to a motion or Bill.96
PUBLICATION OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS
The publication of proceedings in parliament is covered by the same rules as
the reporting of proceedings in court. The underlying principle is thatpublication is in the public interest and generally outweighs any disadvantageto individuals.
On the extent to which the reporting and publication of parliamentary
proceedings is protected, section 1 of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840provides that, where civil or criminal proceedings are commenced, thedefendant may present to the court a certificate stating that the publication inquestion was made under the authority of the House of Lords or House ofCommons, and that the ‘judge or court shall thereupon immediately stay suchcivil or criminal proceeding’.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
58295 HC Deb Col 284, 15 July 1947; HC 118 (1946–47), London: HMSO.
96 HC Deb Cols 604, 661, 6 November 1995.

Parliamentary Privilege
Section 2 provides that similar protection exists for correct copies of official
reports and authorised papers. Section 3 provides that extracts or abstracts
from such reports or papers, for example, in newspapers, are protectedprovided that such extracts are published bona fide and without malice. Thus
papers of the House, or papers ordered to be published by the House, plusfair and accurate, but unauthorised, reports of proceedings are covered byqualified privilege, and an action for damages for injury allegedly caused bytheir publication would only lie if malice could be proven.
The Parliamentary Papers Act was passed as a direct result of two cases in
which the courts and parliament came into conflict, namely Stockdale v
Hansard (1839) and the Sheriff of Middlesex’s Case . While the passing of the
Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 gives statutory authority to publication ofofficial papers and authorised reports, uncertainty still remains as to the scopeof the protection. 
Privilege and the media
Publications which reflect on the dignity of the House as a whole are classifiedas ‘constructive contempts’, as are reflections on individual members.
97
Illustrations of adverse comments published in the press include that of The
Sunday Express which, in 1953, commented that two members were asleep
during an all night sitting of the House. Further, in 1956, The Sunday Express
criticised Members of Parliament for exempting themselves from the petrolrationing which had been imposed as a result of the Suez crises. The report ofthe Committee of Privileges held that the editor had been:
... guilty of a serious contempt in reflecting upon all Members of the House and
so upon the House itself by alleging that Members of the House had beenguilty of contemptible conduct in failing, owing to self interest, to protest at anunfair discrimination in their favour. Such an attack on Members is calculatedto diminish the respect due to the House and so to lessen its authority.
98
The issue of media pressure again fell for consideration by the Committee of
Privileges in 1956. A Member of Parliament, Mr Arthur Lewis, gave notice of aforthcoming Prime Ministerial parliamentary question, which asked:
... whether he will arrange for part of the money contributed by the
government for relief in Hungary to be allocated to the relief of the severalthousand Egyptian people who have been rendered homeless and destitute byBritish shelling and rocket fire in Egypt.
In a scathing editorial in The Sunday Graphic , readers were invited to telephone
Mr Lewis and give him their views. To assist this task, the newspaper
published the member’s telephone number. As a consequence, the memberreceived thousands of irate telephone calls before the Post Office was able tochange his number. The committee ruled that:
58397 Erskine May, 1997, p 121.
98Second Report from the Committee of Privileges , HC 38 (1956–57), London: HMSO.

... the principle that to molest a Member of Parliament on account of his
conduct in Parliament is a breach of privilege is well established ... In our view,the principle clearly applies to the circumstances of this case and, in ouropinion, the Editor of The Sunday Graphic was guilty of a breach of privilege in
that he instigated the molestation to which Mr Lewis was subjected.
99
In both cases, the editors were called to the Bar of the House and apologised. 
Unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary proceedings
The unauthorised disclosure of proceedings conducted in private and of draft
reports of committees which have not been reported to the House is governedby a resolution of the House of 1837, as amended in 1980. The resolutionmakes such disclosure a contempt of the House.
100The House resolved in
1978 that its penal jurisdiction should only be used where the actioncomplained of was likely to cause a ‘substantial interference’ with acommittee’s work.
101The Committee of Privileges recommended in its 1985
report that ‘substantial interference’ with regard to leaked documents shouldbe confined to confidential or classified information or deliberate attempts toundermine the work of the committee.
102
Between 1971 and 1988, six incidents of unauthorised disclosure were
recorded.103In no case was the source of the leak – presumed to be a member
of the select committee – identifiable and, in each case, the journalistsconcerned had refused to reveal their sources. The House has shown itself tobe unwilling to punish publishers when it cannot identify and punish thesource of the leak.
In 1985, The Times newspaper published a leaked draft report of the Home
Affairs Select Committee and a draft report on the Environment SelectCommittee on the disposal of radioactive waste. The Committee of Privilegesrecommended that both the member responsible for the leak and thejournalist should be punished but, when the matter was put to the House, itdeclined to follow the committee’s recommendation.
104
A fresh issue arose in 1999 with the leak of select committee reports to
ministers. In July 1999, a senior Labour Member of Parliament, Earnest Ross,was forced to resign from the Foreign Affairs Select Committee after he hadbeen found responsible for leaking a critical report over the Foreign Office’srole in allegedly breaching a United Nations’ arms embargo in Sierra Leone tothe Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. The leak had the potential, if used by theChapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Parliamentary Privilege
Foreign Secretary, of interfering with the work of the Select Committee. After
criticism by the Standards and Privileges Committee, Mr Ross apologised tothe House and was suspended for ten days. Subsequently, two LabourMembers, one who had leaked a Social Security Select Committee Report andone who had received the report, were suspended from the Commons forthree and five days, respectively. The Prime Minister and the CabinetSecretary then issued directions to ministers and senior civil servants that anyleaked documents were to be returned immediately and without use havingbeen made of them, and that the Ministerial Code of Practice would beamended to cover the leaking of such reports which potentially underminethe authority of Select Committees.
The procedure for determining issues of privilege and contempt
If an allegation of breach of privilege or contempt is made, the complaint iscommunicated to the Speaker. The member will be given written notice of thecomplaint. The Speaker must be satisfied, first, that the matter is one involvingprivilege and, secondly, that the complaint is substantial. If he or she so finds,the Speaker advises the complainant that he may put down a Motion whichwill be debated the following day. For the most part, the matter will then bereferred by the House to the Committee on Standards and Privileges(formerly the Committee of Privileges). The committee is made up of 17 seniormembers of the House from all political parties, chaired by the Leader of theHouse. Although acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, the committee is notbound to follow strict rules of procedure. The legal rules of evidence do notapply and there is normally no legal representation. The Committee sits inprivate.
105If the Committee finds that there has been a breach, it will make
recommendations as to punishment, but has no power to apply the sanction:that is for the House as a whole, who will vote on the matter following adebate. The House is not bound by the Committee’s recommendations andmay, as happened in the case of Strauss (1985) ,reject them.
Members’ interests in the House of Lords
Privilege in the House of Lords
The House of Lords enjoys the same privilege of freedom from arrest106and
freedom of speech as the Commons. Freedom of access to the Sovereign isenjoyed by the House collectively and by each peer individually. Thisprivilege of peerage extends to all peers, irrespective of whether they sit in theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords has the same right as the Commons to

determine its own procedure. In the event of a disputed peerage, the House of
Lords has jurisdiction to determine the matter.107The House of Lords has the
power to commit persons for breach of privilege or contempt and also thepower to impose fines. The House of Lords may also summon judges toattend in order to give advice on points of law. 
Members’ interests in the House of Lords
In July 1995, Lord Griffiths published his report on outside interests of peers.The report was submitted to the Lords’ Procedure Committee. Therecommendations included the introduction of a Register of Members’Interests on which all remunerated positions are to be declared. Peers will nolonger be permitted to act as advocates for companies or organisations fromwhom they receive remuneration. They will, however, continue to be allowedto act as advisers to outside groups. Peers will no longer be free to askquestions or to table amendments where their sponsoring organisation standsto gain benefit. 
In 1996, in response to increased concerns over Members’ interests, a
Register of Members’ Interests was established in the House of Lords. Inaddition, the House has approved a motion that Lords should always act ontheir personal honour and should never accept any financial inducement as anincentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence.
Further reform of parliamentary privilege
In addition to the reforms considered above, there remains a need to clarifythe definition given to the phrase ‘proceedings in parliament’ in Article IX ofthe Bill of Rights in order that both members and other individuals may betterunderstand the scope of the protection given by privilege.
The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege considered the question
of the definition of parliamentary proceedings in its 1999 report. TheCommittee recommended that there should be enacted a ParliamentaryPrivileges Act to cover this and a number of other reforms. 
Defining ‘proceedings in parliament’
Rejecting earlier suggested definitions of parliamentary proceedings as toowide, the Committee proposed the following statutory definition:
(1) For the purposes of Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 ‘proceedings in
Parliament’ means all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for
the purposes of, or necessarily incidental to, transacting the business ofeither House of Parliament or of a committee.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law
586107 See Stourton v Stourton (1963).

Parliamentary Privilege
(2) Without limiting (1), this includes:
(a) the giving of evidence before a House or a committee or an officer
appointed by a House to receive such evidence;
(b) the presentation or submission of a document to a House or a
committee or an officer appointed by a House to receive it, once the
document is accepted;
(c) the preparation of a document for the purposes of transacting the
business of a House or a committee, provided any drafts, notes, adviceor the like are not circulated more widely than is reasonable for thepurposes of preparation;
(d) the formulation, making or publication of a document by a House or a
committee;
(e) the maintenance of any register of the interests of the members of a
House and any other register of interests prescribed by resolution of aHouse.
(3) A ‘committee’ means a committee appointed by either House or a joint
committee appointed by both Houses of Parliament and includes a sub-committee.
(4) A document includes any disc, tape or device in which data are embodied
so as to be capable of being reproduced therefrom. 
In addition, there should be a statutory definition of ‘place out of parliament’,
and the scope of the prohibition on ‘questioning’. Article IX should not applyto court proceedings in so far as they relate to interpretation of Acts ofParliament or subordinate legislation (the Pepper v Hart principle), or to
judicial review. Tribunals appointed under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act 1921 could also be excluded from Article IX. The legislationshould make it clear that the application of Article IX extends to Scotland andNorthern Ireland. Disputes as to the meaning of ‘proceedings in parliament’arising in court proceedings should continue to be resolved by the trial judge,whereas those arising in the House should be dealt with there.
In relation to the question of bribery and corruption of Members in
Parliament, which was the subject of enquiry by the Committee on Standardson Public Life
108and the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege,109the
Government has published its proposals to reform the law and has stated thatit intends to introduce legislation when parliamentary time allows.
110The
government’s proposals are based on the recommendations of the LawCommission.

and to provide a statutory definition clarifying the meaning of ‘acting in a
corrupt manner’. The Act will apply to both the public and private sectors.Liability would extend to extraterritorial offences committed by Britishnationals. The Act will make it clear that the changes in the law apply tomembers of both Houses of Parliament.Chapter 18: Constitutional and Administrative Law

PART VI
THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE



CHAPTER 19
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 4, the rule of law, a concept which portrays the idea of
governmental power limited by law and the democratic process, wasdiscussed. It was seen that from early times the sovereignty of law over manwas proclaimed in order to safeguard citizens from the abuse of power byMonarchs and governments. The protection of individual rights and freedomsby the state is an essential feature of the rule of law. 
THE ORIGINS OF THE IDEA OF RIGHTS:
EARLY CONCEPTIONS OF 
LIMITED GOVERNMENTAL POWER
John Locke
In Two Treatises of Government , John Locke claimed that sovereign power was
limited and that the people had the right to resort to revolution against thesovereign if power was abused. Such writing was both revolutionary andseditious – challenging the very basis of state authority. Locke went into exilein 1683.
1With the accession of William of Orange to the throne in 1689, Locke
returned to England and his work – previously unpublished – reached thelight of day, albeit anonymously. The timing of publication could not havebeen more forceful. An historic settlement between parliament and Crownhad finally and recently been reached, resulting in the Bill of Rights 1689, thusending centuries of conflict. However, Locke’s writing presented a theorywhich challenged the basis of sovereign power by asserting the rights of managainst the sovereign. Much of the first Treatise is an argument directed
against absolute monarchical power and the use of the prerogative. Byinsisting that government held its power on trust, Locke was indirectlyclaiming the sovereignty of the people over the sovereignty of government.Government had a legitimate right to rule, and to use the law for the good ofthe people; but that right was conditional and limited by the ultimate powerof the people to overthrow a government which violated its trust. As Lockeobserved:
... acting for the preservation of the community, there can be but one supreme
power, which is the legislative, to which all the rest are and must besubordinate, yet the legislative being only a fiduciary power to act for certain
591THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

Locke wrote Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Letter on Toleration .

ends, there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the
legislative, when they find the legislative acts contrary to the trust reposed inthem. For all power given with trust for the attaining an end being limited bythat end, whenever that end is manifestly neglected or opposed, the trust mustnecessarily be forfeited, and the power devolve into the hands of those thatgave it, who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety andsecurity. And thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power ofsaving themselves from the attempts and designs of anybody, even of theirlegislators, whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carryon designs against the liberties and properties of the subject. For no man orsociety of men having a power to deliver up their preservation, orconsequently the means of it, to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion ofanother, whenever any one shall go about to bring them into such slavishcondition, they will always have a right to preserve what they have not apower to part with, and to rid themselves of those who invade thisfundamental, sacred, and unalterable law of self-preservation for which theyentered into society. And thus the community may be said in this respect to bealways the supreme power, but not as considered under any form ofgovernment, because this power of the people can never take place till thegovernment be dissolved. [ Two Treatises of Government (1690), 1977, Bk II,
Chapter XIII, para 149]
Thomas Paine
Thomas Paine (1737–1809), who claimed not to have read Locke’s works, was
to echo many of Locke’s radical and revolutionary sentiments. Paine wasinvolved in two revolutions: that of the United States of America, in 1775, andthat of France, in 1789 – an involvement which he claimed made his life ‘trulyuseful’. The background of the two men could not have been more different.Whereas John Locke had a privileged upbringing, being educated atWestminster School, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he remained for some15 years, before entering into service with the Earl of Shaftsbury,
2Thomas
Paine was largely self-educated. In 1773, he issued a pamphlet,3the radical
nature of which caused him to be discharged from his position as anexciseman (customs officer). In the course of his political lobbying for higherpay for fellow excise officers, he met Benjamin Franklin.
4With Franklin’s
support, Paine emigrated to North America. 
While John Locke had been writing against the background of the
constitutional struggles in the United Kingdom, which were to culminate inthe assertion of parliament’s sovereignty over the King, Paine was writing inthe midst of the struggle for independence in America against the sovereignEnglish King George III. In 1775, Paine, working as a journalist on theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Protection of Human Rights
Pennsylvania Journal , was supporting the right of colonists to control their own
affairs. In criticising England for her treatment of, among others, American
Indians and black slaves, Paine predicted the eventual separation of Americafrom Britain. In 1776, he published Common Sense, which not only attacked the
policy of the King towards the colony, but also attacked the institution ofmonarchy itself. Common Sense exerted a profound influence on the course of
political events, and the Declaration of Independence (4 July 1776) echoedPaine’s sentiments. In both Common Sense and Rights of Man, arbitrary power
is decried and the freedom of the individual declared to be sovereign. Painedistinguished between the natural and civil rights of individuals:
Natural rights are those which appertain to man in right of his existence. Of
this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and also thoserights of acting as an individual for his own comfort and happiness, which arenot injurious to the natural rights of others. Civil rights are those whichappertain to man in right of his being a member of society. Every civil right hasfor its foundation, some natural right pre-existing in the individual, but to theenjoyment of which his individual power is not, in all cases, sufficientlycompetent. [Rights of Man (1791–92), Part II, p 90]
Civil rights, for Paine, are entailed in, and grow out of, individual natural
rights and are, accordingly, antecedent to any form of government. Whenman entered into society:
... the individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right,
entered into a compact with each other to produce a government: and this isthe only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the onlyprinciple on which they have a right to exist. [p 92]
Furthermore:
The rights of men in society, are neither devisable, nor transferable, norannihilable, but are descendable only; and it is not in the power of anygeneration to intercept finally, and cut off the descent. 
The American constitution reflected these views, the preamble declaring that:
We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union,establish Justice, ensure Domestic Tranquillity, provide for the CommonDefence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty toourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this CONSTITUTION forthe United States of America. 
THE EMERGENCE OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF RIGHTS
These early expressions of an emergent notion of individual rights can be seen
today in most written constitutions in the world, whether or not theconstitution is ‘autochthonous’.
5
5935 Defined as a constitution originating from, and having the authority of, the people it
governs: it springs from the people and is not conferred upon the people from any
higher authority. See Wheare, 1966.

The attempt to protect human rights on an international level began with
the founding of the League of Nations after World War I and the imposition of
certain safeguards of human rights in peace treaties negotiated after the warfor the protection of minorities. It was not to be, however, until after theSecond World War that the international community became convinced of thereal and pressing need to protect and promote human rights as an integraland essential element for the preservation of world peace and co-operation.The United Nations
6provided the appropriate forum for international quasi-
legislative activity. In 1948, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights wasadopted, supplemented by two implementing international covenants in 1966:the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Taken together, thesedocuments represent an international Bill of Human Rights. Inspired by theUnited Nations Declaration and Covenants, many other regional conventionswere drafted, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms 1950, the American Convention of Human Rights1969 and the African Charter of 1987.
7
Natural law and positive law8
The ancient concept of natural law, as discussed in Chapter 4, concerns anevaluation of the validity of human law against some higher source ofauthority, whether theological or secular, which is both eternal and universal.The demands of natural law challenge the law of human rulers – demandingthat law conform to higher principles. One such principle is the respect forindividual rights and freedoms, and it may therefore be argued that theprotection of human rights is a natural law concept. It should not be assumed,however, that the assertions that the rights of man derive from natural law hasbeen completely or unequivocally accepted.
In the nineteenth century, for example, the rise of nationalism in the West
challenged doctrines of natural law. The same century also witnessed the risein positivism – the legal-theoretical schools of thought concerned solely toidentify and define the concept of valid human law. These two developments– nationalism and positivism – shifted the focus of attention away fromindividual rights towards an analysis of state power. By way of illustration,Hegel’s Philosophy of Right (1821) portrayed the picture of the state as
absolutely sovereign, its form and content being determined by history, but itsexistence and power being unrestricted by any form of natural law. 
In the United Kingdom, the Scottish philosopher David Hume laid the
foundations for positivism.
9Positivism, in its many forms, concerns theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
5946 Which superseded the League of Nations in 1945.
7 See, also, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights based on the UN Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.

9 See An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751), Political Discourses (1752).

The Protection of Human Rights
endeavour of isolating the law laid down by human superior (the sovereign
power) to human inferior (the subject).10In essence, Hume’s thesis was that,
in logic, it is not possible to derive a statement of fact (an existential statement)from a statement of what ought to be (a normative statement). By thisreasoning, only by keeping statements of fact and statements of ‘ought’ – ormoral statements – separate can there be a true understanding of reality, andlaw. The implication of such a distinction for law and legal theory is that nomoral statement as to what ‘ought to be’ can be inferred from a purely factualstatement. This essential logical separation of the factual from the normativeunderlies the positivist endeavour: the attempt to provide a coherent logicalstructure of legal rules, and legal rules alone, unaffected by morality. For thepositivist, whatever is enacted according to the accepted constitutionalprocedure employed within the state is valid law and entails an absoluteobligation of obedience. As such, there can be no claim to freedoms or humanrights which are capable of overriding the positive law. According topositivist theories of law, while in a perfect world the positive law may – andideally should – conform to moral precepts, should it fail so to do, theindividual is powerless to confront the law. 
The nineteenth century rise in positivism represented both an attack on the
claims of natural law and an attempt to analyse scientifically the law as itexists in fact. The doctrine of natural law for which so much had been claimedin relation to human rights and freedoms was placed on the defensive. Theprotection of rights based on natural law was further damaged by theutilitarians. Having rejected natural law as providing the lodestar forenactment of positive law, the utilitarians adopted the principle of utility. Byutility is meant that the proper guidance in the formation of laws is the overalleffect of a legislative proposal on society as a whole. A proposal for legislationwill be in conformity with the doctrine of utility if it increases the sum ofhappiness in society overall. The leading exponent of the utilitarian schoolwas Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) whose An Introduction to the Principles of
Morals and Legislation was to exert enduring influence. Bentham dismissed the
idea of natural law and natural rights: natural rights were ‘nonsense’ – and,worse – ‘nonsense on stilts’. 
Despite the attacks from nationalists, positivists and utilitarians, the quest
for the protection of rights – from wheresoever derived – continued; a questwhich became reinvigorated by the horrors of the Second World War.
Rights and freedoms in Britain
It has long been a paradox that the United Kingdom – viewed as a liberaldemocratic state – should have no comprehensive written Bill of Rights.
11
59510 See, eg, Austin (1832), 1954; Hart, 1961, Chapters 1–4.
11 The Bill of Rights 1689, it will be recalled, was concerned with constitutional
arrangements between the Crown and parliament, not with the rights of individuals.

This is especially so, given that the United Kingdom has been responsible for
restoring independence to many former colonies and dominions and, in sodoing, has conferred upon those states both a written constitution and a Bill ofRights. However, the Human Rights Act 1998, discussed below, now providesa yardstick against which to measure current law and proposals for newlegislation, and marks a significant conceptual change in the manner in whichrights are regarded in the United Kingdom. 
In the Labour Party’s 1996 general election Manifesto, the Party undertook
to incorporate Convention rights.
12The Human Rights Act 1998 marks a
significant constitutional change in relation to citizens’ awareness about rights,and their protection by judges in the domestic courts. The Act and itsimplications are considered later in this chapter. Prior to incorporation ofConvention rights, the judges used the Convention as an aid to interpretationto assist in resolving ambiguities in domestic law. However, given thesupremacy of parliament, the judges previously had no jurisdictional basis onwhich directly to employ the Convention to protect rights. The Human RightsAct confers this jurisdiction, requiring the courts not only to protectConvention rights, but to make ‘declarations of incompatibility’ whereverdomestic law is judicially seen to conflict with Convention rights. By thismeans, parliament preserves its supremacy over changes in the law which maybe required by judicial evaluation of domestic law against the provisions of theConvention. Before considering the Human Rights Act, however, it isnecessary to understand the status and working of the European Conventionand the scope and application of the Convention rights which the Actincorporates. 
PART A: THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS13
Introduction
Europe was one of the principal theatres of the Second World War, followingwhich there was felt to be a great need for European political, social andeconomic unity. Those objectives were perceived to be promoted, in part, bythe adoption a uniform Convention designed to protect human rights andfundamental freedoms.
14In 1949, the Council of Europe was established and
the Convention on Human Rights ratified by Member States in 1951, comingChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
59612 See the Consultation Paper, Bringing Rights Home: Labour’s Plans to Incorporate the
European Convention on Human Rights into United Kingdom Law , 1996, London: Labour
Party. Note that technically the Human Rights Act 1998 does not incorporate the
Convention, but rather makes Convention rights enforceable before the domesticcourts.
13 The literature on the Convention is extensive. See, inter alia , Fawcett, 1987; Jacobs, 1975;
Van Dijk and Van Hoof, 1990; Palley, 1991; Harris, O’Boyle and Warbrick, 1995.

The Protection of Human Rights
into force in 1953.15Despite having been instrumental in the drafting of the
text of the Convention, the British government had strong reservations about
the Convention and its impact on British constitutional law. As a result ofsuch reservations, it was not until 1965 that the government gave individualsthe right to petition under the Convention.
The status of the Convention under English law prior to the
Human Rights Act 199816
The attitude of the United Kingdom courts towards the Convention has, in the
past, been the traditional one adopted in relation to treaties. Treaties form partof international law and have no place within the domestic legal order unlessand until incorporated into law.
17The courts regarded the Convention as an
aid to interpretation but had no jurisdiction directly to enforce the rights andfreedoms under the Convention.
18This could, however, of itself be significant.
For example, in Waddington v Miah (1974), Lord Reid stated – having referred
to Article 7 of the Convention which prohibits retrospective legislation – that‘it is hardly credible that any government department would promote, or thatparliament would pass, retrospective criminal legislation’.
19
The influence of the Convention before the Human Rights Act
1998
While previously lacking the jurisdiction to enforce Convention rights. the
English courts were nevertheless influenced by Convention provisions. Byway of example of the influence of the Convention, in R v Secretary of State for
the Home Department ex parte Brind (1991) ,the Home Secretary had exercised
his discretionary power under section 19(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 toissue a notice requiring the Independent Broadcasting Authority ‘to refrainfrom broadcasting any matter or classes of matter specified in the notice’. In1988, with the aim of depriving those connected directly or indirectly withterrorist activity related to Northern Ireland of the ‘oxygen of publicity’, theHome Secretary issued a notice prohibiting the broadcasting on television orradio of the voices of any person speaking on behalf of a ‘proscribedorganisation’. The words used could be reported through the medium of anactor, provided that the voice of the spokesperson was not broadcast. Thechallenge to this prohibition was, in the House of Lords, based primarily onthe argument that it was contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations underArticle 10 of the Convention, guaranteeing freedom of expression. It was
59715 For a succinct history of the Convention, see Lester (Lord), ‘European human rights and
the British constitution’, in Jowell and Oliver, 1994.
16 See Browne-Wilkinson, 1992; Bingham, 1993; Laws, 1993.
17 See Kaur v Lord Advocate (1980).
18Waddington v Miah (1974).
19 See, further, below for the (retrospective) War Crimes Act 1991.

argued that the Home Secretary should have had regard to the Convention in
exercising his discretion under the Broadcasting Act. 
The House of Lords was prepared to accept that there was a presumption
that parliament would enact laws that were in conformity with theConvention. Accordingly, it was accepted that, where a statute permits twointerpretations, one in line with the Convention, the other contrary to it, theinterpretation which fitted with the Convention should be preferred. TheHouse of Lords, however, was not prepared to accept that where a discretioncould be exercised, the presumption that parliament intended that it shouldbe exercised having regard to the Convention must be applied. Lord Bridgestated that to do so would go beyond the resolution of ambiguity and would,in effect, compel the courts to enforce conformity with the Convention.
20In
Brind, the court could find no ambiguity in section 29(3) of the Broadcasting
Act. The only basis for challenge therefore was that the Home Secretary’sdecision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury
21sense, that is to say, that the
decision was so irrational or unreasonable that no rational or reasonableperson could have reached the same decision.
A rather different approach to the Convention was adopted in Derbyshire
County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd, concerning the question of whether a
local council could bring an action in libel against newspapers (see, further,below). In the Court of Appeal, Butler-Sloss LJ was forthright in declaring that‘where there is ambiguity, or the law is otherwise unclear as so far undeclaredby an appellate court, the English court is not only entitled but ... obliged toconsider the implications of Article 10’. The House of Lords, however, whilearriving at the result achieved in the Court of Appeal – namely that localauthorities enjoyed no standing to sue in defamation – did so without relyingon Article 10 of the Convention, but relying on the common law. 
Accordingly, there existed (before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into
force) no obligation for courts to rely on the Convention if a source ofauthority can be found within domestic law. Increasingly, however, itappeared that – within certain limits – the judiciary expressed willingness toprotect individual liberties and, where a statute was ambiguous, or silent, toconstrue the statute strictly and in favour of the liberty of the citizen.
However, there were limits to the extent to which judges were able to
protect rights, as the case of R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte
Rossminster Ltd (1980) revealed.
22In Rossminster , the House of Lords ruled
that, where the meaning of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the courtpossessed no jurisdiction to go against its unambiguous words, and wasunder a duty to uphold the will of parliament by giving effect to its words. InChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
59820 On the post Human Rights Act 1998 position and ambiguity, see Irvine (Lord), 1998.

Chapter 25.

ex parte Hussain Ahmed (1998).

The Protection of Human Rights
both Attorney General v BBC (1981) and Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers
(No 2) (1990) ,however, the House of Lords confirmed that it was the duty of
the courts to have regard to the international obligations assumed under the
Convention, and to interpret the law in accordance with those obligations.
The application of Convention provisions in the interim period between
the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998 and its coming into effect inEngland and Wales was considered by the House of Lords in R v DPP ex parte
Kebeline and Others (1999). The House of Lords ruled, on an appeal by the
Director of Public Prosecutions from a decision of the Divisional Court, thatthe decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to proceed with aprosecution under section 16A of the Prevention of Terrorism (TemporaryProvisions) Act 1989, which reverses the burden of proof in relation to thepossession of articles for purposes connected with terrorist activities andwhich is, arguably, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention, was not unlawful.
INSTITUTIONS AND PROCEDURE 
UNDER THE CONVENTION
The Council of Europe, under which the Convention operates, isconstitutionally distinct from the European Community. The Council wasfounded in 1949, inspired by the United Nation’s Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights of 1948. The Committee of Ministers is the political body,consisting of one representative from each state government (usually ForeignMinisters). The Commission, comprising one member from each country, iselected by the Committee of Ministers, but acts independently, ‘serving intheir individual capacity’.
23The Court of Human Rights – elected by the
Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe – represents the judicialbody.
24Judges are elected for a renewable nine year term of office,25and need
not be drawn exclusively from the judiciary in Member States. Thequalifications for appointment are defined as being persons ‘of high moralcharacter’ who must either possess the qualifications required forappointment of high judicial office or be jurisconsults of recognisedcompetence.
26
Prior to 1998, the role of the Commission was to act as a filter for
applications. By employing the rules on admissibility in Articles 26 and 27 ofthe Convention, the Commission exercised a quasi-judicial function. The effectof an application being declared inadmissible was that the matter wouldnever reach the Court of Human Rights. If declared admissible, theCommission investigated the case fully and attempted to reach a friendly
59923 European Convention on Human Rights, Article 23.
24Ibid, Articles 38–43. On the role of the Court, see Gearty, 1993.
25Ibid, Article 40.
26Ibid, Article 38.

settlement between the parties,27namely, the state and the aggrieved
individual.28If negotiations for the friendly settlement failed, a report was
sent by the Commission to the state concerned and to the Council of
Ministers.29The matter could then be determined by the Council of Ministers
– deciding by a two-thirds majority – thus conferring on the politicalinstitution a judicial function. Alternatively, the case could be referred to theCourt by the Commission or by the state concerned.
30Originally, the
complainant had no involvement in the proceedings, let alone the right toinsist that the matter be referred to the Court. Since 1983, the complainant hasa right to be represented before the Court and, by an amendment to Article 48,a limited right to refer the case to the Court.
31The decision of the Court is
final and binding on states.32Between 1955 and 1991, 11 inter-state cases, but
17,116 complaints from individuals, had been considered by the Commission.
From November 1998, under Protocol 11 of the Convention on Human
Rights, the Commission and Court are merged into a single Court performingthe tasks of both the Commission and the Court. The objectives sought aregreater clarity for the citizen in terms of organisation and better control ofcases. By this means, the Court is able to scrutinise applications and determinethe admissibility of a complaint. Speed and cost are also factors in thereformed procedures. On average, when cases go to the Court, it takes somefour to five years before a final decision is reached.
Further, in October 1993, the 32 European nations agreed to strengthen the
powers of the Council of Europe. It was reported that nine nations had joinedsince 1989 and that, by the end of 1992, the number of cases before the Courtswas 1,861, compared with only 404 in 1981. Most recently joined as candidatemembers are Russia, the Ukraine, Belorussia, Moldavia, Latvia, Albania andCroatia. The summit recorded disquiet over resurging nationalism –especially in the Balkans. Full membership of the Council for these countrieswill depend upon their record in the protection of minorities.
The right of application
Inter-state applications33
By 1994, only 18 inter-state complaints had been recorded, and many of theseinvolved the same factual situation. In relation to the United Kingdom,Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
60027 In McDaid and Others v United Kingdom (2000), six applications were struck out as a
friendly settlement was reached. The British government agreed payment of legal costs
and expenses incurred in court-martial proceedings with respect to which it was allegedthat the applicants had not had a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 6(1).

33Ibid, Article 33.

The Protection of Human Rights
Republic of Ireland v United Kingdom (1976), discussed above, is the most
significant.
Complaints from individuals34
The right of individual petition to a body outside the jurisdiction of states was
a constitutional innovation. As noted above, the British government wasexceedingly cautious about conceding such a right and only in 1965 did theright of individual application become available to citizens of the UnitedKingdom. Applications may be from individuals, groups of individuals ornon-governmental organisations. The applicant(s) must be personally affectedby the issue: complaints involving alleged conduct which does not personallyaffect the individual complainant are not admissible.
35
The procedure
Exhaustion of domestic remedies
Any domestic remedies which are available must be exhausted.36Thus, if a
remedy is available within domestic law, it must first be sought. Only wherethere exists no remedy in law, or where the pursuit of a remedy would beunequivocally certain to fail,
37may an individual lodge a petition.
The time limit
The application must be made within six months of the final decision of thehighest court having jurisdiction within the domestic legal system.
38
Admissibility
A number of hurdles face the applicant in having his application declaredadmissible:
(a) a complaint must not constitute an ‘abuse of right of complaint’. In
essence, this means that the complainant should not be pursuing a remedy
out of improper motives – such as political advantage. In short, thecomplaint must be brought for genuine reasons;
(b) a complaint must not be anonymous;
(c) a complaint must not relate to a matter which has been investigated and
ruled upon previously;
(d) a complaint must not relate to a right which is not protected under the
Convention;
60134 European Convention on Human Rights, Article 34.
35X v Norway (1960). See, also, Vijayanathan v France (1991).
36 European Convention on Human Rights, Article 35.37 Eg, where there are strong precedents established.
38 European Convention on Human Rights, Article 35.

(e) a complaint is inadmissible if, although the application relates to a
protected right, the State against which the complaint is made has
derogated from that provision, or lodged a reservation (see below forfurther discussion of derogations and reservations);
(f) the application must relate to violation of the Convention by a State which
is bound by the Convention, or to an organisation for which the State hasresponsibility;
(g) the application must not be such that it represents an attack on another
right protected by the Convention. Article 17 provides that there is noright to ‘engage in any activity or perform any act’ which is aimed at thedestruction of protected rights;
(h) a complaint must not be ‘manifestly ill founded’. By this is meant that the
application must be plausible – there must be prima facie evidence of a
violation.
Once an application is declared admissible, the examination of the merits willcommence. The complainant has a limited right to appear where the Courtrequires further evidence. The Court’s decision must be reasoned and, if notunanimous, there is a right for individual judges to give a separate opinion.Under Article 43(1) of the Convention, any party to the case may, within threemonths from the date of the judgment of a Chamber (effectively the ‘court offirst instance’ hearing the case), request that the case be referred to the GrandChamber. If it is not so referred, the judgment becomes final. Alternatively, ifreferred, the judgment of the Grand Chamber is final and Member Statesundertake to abide by the decision of the Court. Compensation can beawarded by the Court.
Enforcing the judgment
The task of ensuring that the judgment is complied with is for the Committeeof Ministers: the matter is thus returned to the political arena. If a state refusesto comply with the judgment, its membership of the Council of Europe can besuspended or, ultimately, it may be expelled from the Council. Whereexercised, this ultimate power has regrettable implications and would removethe protection of the Convention from individuals within the state and thusfurther damage the protection of rights. Greece withdrew from the Council ofEurope following five allegations of persecution against it between 1967 and1970. In 1974, a new Greek government ratified the Convention once more.However, failure to comply with a judgment will cause adverse publicity forthe state and there is thus great political pressure to conform. Following thejudgment in Brogan v United Kingdom (1988), concerning the seven day
detention provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Acts, however, the Britishgovernment announced its intention to derogate from the protection given inArticle 5 to the right to liberty and freedom and access to a court of law for thedetermination of the legality of detention.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
602

The Protection of Human Rights
THE ‘MARGIN OF APPRECIATION’
In respect of almost all Articles of the Convention, there is an area of
discretion as to the means by which they protect the substantive rights. Thismargin of appreciation is necessary in order that the Convention can apply ina workable fashion in very differing societies. It also means, however, thatapplication to the Convention will not be uniform throughout the legalsystems and that states may be able to deviate from the protection given.
Whether the state has a margin of appreciation – and the scope of it – is a
matter to be determined under the Convention. The doctrine is unpredictablein operation and has become, over the years, applicable to all Articles.Accordingly, it is a concept which is capable of significantly undermining theprotection given by the Convention, and has been criticised for so doing.
39
DEROGATION AND RESERVATION
Where a state finds it impossible or undesirable to comply with specificArticles, it is possible for the state to derogate, or enter a reservation as to thematter.
40No derogation is permitted in relation to Article 2 (the right to life),
other than in war situations. Derogation is not allowed in respect of Articles 3(freedom from torture), 4(1) (slavery or servitude), and 7 (freedom fromretrospective criminal liability).
41The right of derogation is limited. Article 15
provides that:
1 In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation
any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its
obligations under this Convention to the extent strictly required by theexigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are notinconsistent with its other obligations under international law.
2 No derogation from Article 2, except in respect of deaths resulting from
lawful acts of war, or from Articles 3, 4 (paragraph 1) and 7 shall be madeunder this provision.
3 Any High Contracting Party availing himself of this right of derogation
shall keep the Secretary General of the Council of Europe fully informed ofthe measures which it has taken and the reasons therefor. It shall alsoinform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe when suchmeasures have ceased to operate and the provisions of the Convention areagain being fully executed.
A challenge can be made to the lawfulness of derogation. Following the
United Kingdom’s derogation after the decision in Brogan v United Kingdom
(1988), a challenge was lodged, but failed when it was held that the situation

in Northern Ireland did amount to a public emergency42and was thus within
the terms of Article 15.43
Cases against the United Kingdom44
By 1997, a total of 50 successful applications had been made, alleging
violations under the Convention, against the United Kingdom. Thesignificance of the figures should not be exaggerated. In all other Europeancountries,
45either the Convention is enshrined in law or the constitution of
the state provides a Bill of Rights. The United Kingdom was thus in theminority of states of the Council of Europe in not previously having suchprotective legislation.
THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS: 
THE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS
ARTICLE 1
The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within jurisdiction the
rights and freedoms defined in Section 1 of this Convention.
ARTICLE 2
1 Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived
of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court
following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided bylaw.
2 Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of
this Article when it results from the use of force which is not more thanabsolutely necessary:
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person
lawfully detained;
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or
insurrection.
The scope of this Article is broad but vague. It is clear that imposition of the
death penalty is not per se contrary to the Convention, although there may be
situations where the circumstances leading up to imposition of the deathpenalty amount to a violation of Article 3, which prohibits torture or inhumanor degrading punishment or treatment. However, it is much less clear as tothe duty, if any, which is imposed on states to sustain life by providing, forChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

43 See, further, below on derogation under the Human Rights Act 1998.
44 See Bradley, ‘The United Kingdom before the Strasbourg Court 1975–90’, in Finnie et al,
1991.
45 The Republic of Ireland and Denmark have not incorporated the Convention, but each
has its own Bill of Rights.

The Protection of Human Rights
example, the economic and social conditions under which the right to life is
meaningfully upheld. In Simon-Herald v Austria (1971), for example,
allegations that the state had failed to provide adequate medical care toprisoners was ruled admissible, although a friendly settlement was reachedthus avoiding the need for a judicial analysis. 
Issues are also raised under Article 2 as to the legality of euthanasia and
abortion. Under domestic law, euthanasia – the act of facilitating a person’sdeath when suffering from an incurable illness – amounts to murder andwould also appear to be a violation of Article 2, if sanctioned by the state. Inrelation to abortion, under United Kingdom law, there is a restricted right toabortion under the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended). Whether such provisionsviolate Article 2 depends on the interpretation given to the word ‘everyone’ inArticle 1. Domestic law has consistently ruled that legal protection of theperson commences at birth, and not before, a view supported in Paton v United
Kingdom (1980), although whether the right to unrestricted abortion would
violate the Article was mooted in Open Door Counselling and Dublin Well
Woman Centre v Ireland (1992).
The allowable exceptions to the protection of Article 2 are designed to
excuse unintentional causes of death in violent situations. Thus the use ofplastic bullets in a riot will not violate Article 2,
46nor will measures taken to
prevent possible future terrorist activities.47There are, however, limits to the
lawful use of force. In Kelly v United Kingdom (1993), an application under
Article 2 was rejected as manifestly ill founded. Soldiers had shot dead ajoyrider who had attempted to avoid an army checkpoint, and the use of forcewas held to be justifiable. The killing of three Irish Republican Army membersby members of the SAS in Gibraltar
48was challenged under the European
Convention on Human Rights. In McGann, Farrell and Savage v United Kingdom
(1995), the Court ruled that, given the information which the security forceshad received regarding the movements of the suspected terrorists, theirshooting did not violate Article 2 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Courtruled that there had been inadequate control over the security forces operationand that, as a result, the killing of the suspected terrorists was ‘more thanabsolutely necessary’ as provided within Article 2. Thus the action taken, to belawful, must be proportionate to the circumstances of the case. A violation ofArticle 2 was also found in Andronicus and Constantinou v Cyprus (1996),a case
arising when the police, in a siege operation, fired at the hostage taker butkilled the hostage. It was held that the number of bullets fired reflected a lackof caution in the operation.

UK; Shanaghan v UK (2001), the families of men shot dead by the SAS and

48 For further details on the circumstances, see Chapter 23.

Royal Ulster Constabulary in three incidents between 1982 and 1992 were
each awarded £10,000 compensation by the Court. It ruled that the authoritieshad failed to conduct a proper investigation into the circumstances of thepersons killed in the fight against terrorism. The required investigation had tobe independent and effective in the sense that it was capable of leading to adetermination of whether the force used was or was not justified in thecircumstances and to the identification and punishment of thoseresponsible.
49See also Edwards v United Kingdom (2002), in which the United
Kingdom was found to have violated Article 2 through its failure to protectthe life of a prisoner who was killed in his cell. 
ARTICLE 3
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
In Ireland v United Kingdom (1978), the Republic of Ireland50alleged that the
United Kingdom had, inter alia , violated Article 3 of the Convention, which
proscribes ‘inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. In 1966, the
United Kingdom had declared that there was a state of emergency inNorthern Ireland. In 1971, acting under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)Act 1922,
51the government introduced new powers of detention and
internment of suspected Irish Republican Army terrorists. Fourteen suspectswere subjected to such techniques as hooding, wall-standing for between 23and 29 hours, noise intrusions and deprivation of sleep, food and water wereemployed. There was evidence that the men subjected to these practicessuffered a loss of weight and pain. Between August and November 1971, atotal of some 980 suspects were arrested
52and further allegations of ill
treatment made. The Compton Committee of Inquiry,53ruled that the
interrogation techniques amounted to ill treatment. The government of theRepublic of Ireland alleged violations of Articles 3, 5 and 14. 
The Court ruled that the techniques, applied in combination and with
premeditation for hours at a time caused, if not actual bodily injury, at leastintense physical and mental suffering and led to acute psychiatricdisturbances. The treatment fell within the meaning of inhuman treatment; itwas also degrading, arousing feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capableof humiliating and debasing them and breaking their physical or moralresistance. To amount to torture, however, comparison must be made withinhuman and degrading treatment. The distinction, ruled the Court, derivesfrom the difference in the intensity of suffering inflicted. In this case it did notChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

occasion suffering of a particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word
torture as understood by the Court.54
In Tyrer v United Kingdom (1978), the Court ruled on the compatibility of
birching as a judicial punishment in the Isle of Man with the requirements ofArticle 3. Tyrer, then aged 15, was given three strokes of the birch aspunishment for an assault on a school prefect. The question raised waswhether the punishment amounted to a violation of Article 3. The Court heldthat, while a conviction for a criminal offence itself could humiliate, for afinding to be sustained under Article 3, there needed to be found ahumiliation deriving from the execution of punishment imposed. Thetreatment must attain a particular level and the assessment was relative: theassessment turns on the nature and context of the punishment and themethod of its execution. Corporal punishment, the Court stated in Tyrer , may
be undesirable without necessarily being degrading. When inflicted withproper safeguards and when traditionally sanctioned for offences in thesociety to which the offender belongs, it may not be degrading. The mere factthat the punishment being inflicted was distasteful was not enough. Underthe circumstances, with the victim having to undress, the treatment reached alevel of degrading punishment.
Corporal punishment of children may also violate Article 3 .
55In Costello-
Roberts v United Kingdom (1993), the Court indicated that there is a distinction
to be drawn between ordinary physical punishment, which may not violatethe Convention, and corporal punishment, which is degrading. Thedetermination as to whether or not the requirements of the Convention havebeen breached will depend upon the conditions under which the punishmentis inflicted. In A v United Kingdom (1998), the stepfather of a child had beaten
him with a stick, resulting in bruising which a paediatrician considered toindicate that he had been beaten with considerable force on more than oneoccasion. The Court of Human Rights held that domestic law did not provideadequate protection for children in relation to treatment or punishmentcontrary to Article 3 of the Convention. 
The law relating to immigration, race and citizenship has also been tested
under Article 3. In East African Asians v United Kingdom (1973), the
immigration legislation (the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968) restrictedimmigration of British passport holders in East Africa, preventing those whohad neither a parent or grandparent born or naturalised in the UnitedKingdom from entering the country. The Commission ruled that racialdiscrimination of this type constituted a form of affront to human dignity andamounted to degrading treatment.
60754 There was no violation of Article 14 (the harsher treatment given to the IRA suspects
was justified by their greater menace), and no violation of Article 1 (which cannot be a
head for a separate breach of the ECHR).
55 See Campbell and Cozens (1982).

Issues are also raised as to the lawfulness of the conditions under which a
prisoner is detained.56InPrice v United Kingdom (2001), the Court of Human
Rights ruled that the detention of a severely disabled person in unsuitable
conditions at a police station and subsequently detention in prison in similarconditions amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3.
57
In Z and Others v United Kingdom (2001), the Court of Human Rights ruled
that the United Kingdom authorities had failed to provide children withappropriate protection against serious, long term neglect and abuse whichamounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of Article 3. TheCourt also ruled that there was a violation of Article 13 due to the lack ofappropriate means to determine the local authority’s responsibility for thedamage suffered as well as the impossibility of obtaining an enforceableaward of compensation. Proceedings against the local authority claimingdamages for negligence had been struck out by the House of Lords, whichruled that local authorities should not be held liable in negligence in respect ofthe exercise of their statutory duties (those under the Children Act 1989) as amatter of public policy.
58
The rights of persons to remain in the United Kingdom may also be raised
under Article 3. If an individual is returned to his homeland in the knowledgethat he will there suffer certain imprisonment or death, a state may violateArticle 3 by refusing to allow him to remain. Two illustrative cases may becited. In Soering v United Kingdom (1989), the applicant successfully alleged
that his extradition to the United States on a charge of capital murder, whichwould result in his detention on Death Row prior to execution, would amountto a breach of Article 3. Conversely, in Vilvarajah and Four Others v United
Kingdom (1991) ,the applicants had applied for political asylum in the United
Kingdom, fearing persecution if they returned to Sri Lanka. Followingdeportation four of them were arrested and ill treated. No breach of Article 3was established, since the court held that there was no clear risk of illtreatment proven, only a possibility of ill treatment.
The issue was tested in Chahal v United Kingdom (1997), in which the Court
of Human Rights ruled, by twelve votes to seven, that the United Kingdomviolated Article 3 of the Convention and – unanimously – that there had beena violation of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3, in that effective remediesdid not exist before the courts in England. In addition, there was also aviolation of Article 5(4), in that Mr Chahal had been denied the opportunity tohave the lawfulness of his detention decided by a national court.
Mr Chahal, a Sikh, had been politically active in Sikh affairs. In 1990, the
Home Secretary decided to deport him from the United Kingdom on theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

damage and a total of £39,000 for costs and expenses.

ground of national security and the international fight against terrorism. He
was arrested in 1990 and detained. Mr Chahal applied for political asylum,claiming he would be a victim of torture if deported to India. Mr Chahal hadbeen subject to torture in India on a visit in 1984. The Court was appraised ofsubstantiated allegations of torture by the authorities in India. By refusing MrChahal asylum and threatening to deport him, the United Kingdomauthorities violated Article 3. Mr Chahal’s detention on the basis of nationalsecurity was not a violation of Article 5(1), since there was prima facie evidence
that national security would be threatened by his release. 
The threat to remove was retested in D v United Kingdom (1997). D had
arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 from his country of origin, St Kitts. Onarrival, he was found to have in his possession a substantial quantity ofcocaine. Rather than being deported, he was arrested and charged withillegally importing a controlled drug. He was convicted and sentenced to sixyears imprisonment. In 1994, the applicant was diagnosed as HIV positiveand suffering from AIDS. A medical report of 1996 indicated that his lifeexpectancy was limited to eight to 12 months. In January 1996, shortly beforethe applicant was due to be released from prison on licence, the immigrationauthorities ordered his removal to St Kitts. D applied unsuccessfully forjudicial review. His appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Anapplication was lodged under the Convention.
The Court of Human Rights ruled that Article 3 prohibited in absolute
terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and itsguarantees applied, irrespective of the reprehensible nature of the conduct ofthe person in question. The Court was not limited to considering Article 3within the context of anticipated torture or inhuman treatment on the part ofthe public authorities of the recipient country. The applicant’s condition wasdeteriorating. To remove him to St Kitts, where he had no family willing tocare for him or home of his own, and no guarantee of adequate medicaltreatment, would expose him to ‘a real risk of dying in the most distressingcircumstances and thus to inhuman treatment contrary to Article 3’.
ARTICLE 4
1 No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
2 No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.3 For the purpose of this Article the term ‘forced or compulsory labour’ shall
not include:(a) any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention
imposed according to the provisions of Article 5 of this Convention or
during conditional release from such detention;
(b) any service of a military character or, in the case of conscientious
objectors in countries where they are recognised, service exactedinstead of compulsory military service;
(c) any service exacted in case of any emergency or calamity threatening
the life or well being of the community;
(d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations.

This provision has little relevance in the majority of Western democracies and
has given rise to little case law. Challenges have been made relating to therequirement that German lawyers undertake compulsory legal aid work, butthese have failed.

ARTICLE 5
1 Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in

4 Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be
entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall
be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention isnot lawful.

5 Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention

69
This long and intricate Article has provided the platform for many challenges
on behalf of persons detained and is in many cases linked to Article 6. Thefirst requirement to be met in relation to Article 5 is that, where a person isdeprived of his liberty, the deprivation must be in consequence of a lawfuldetention.
In Weeks v United Kingdom (1987),
70the issue raised, under Article 5(1)(a),
was whether the revocation of a life licence deprives a person of his libertywithout the conviction of a court of law. In that case, the applicant had beensentenced to life imprisonment but, after ten years, was released on licence.The Home Secretary revoked the licence after Weeks had failed to stay out oftrouble. The Court held, however, that the original sentence was passed in theknowledge that the Home Secretary enjoyed a discretion as to the liberty ofprisoners under sentence and that, accordingly, there was a sufficient linkbetween the original sentence passed, the granting of a licence, and therevocation of the licence.
The lawfulness of arrest was also tested in Steel and Others v United
Kingdom (1998). In a case involving five applicants, allegations of breaches of
Articles 5, 6, 10, 11 and 13 were made. The applicants had been involved inanimal rights and other protests, and had been arrested and charged withbreach of the peace. In relation to Article 5(1), while the concept of breach ofthe peace was sufficiently clear and formulated ‘with the degree of precisionrequired by the Convention’, where, as in the case of three of the applicants,the protest had been entirely peaceful and there had been no obstruction ofothers or any provocation of others to violence, the Court ruled that theirarrest and subsequent detention was not lawful within the meaning of Article5(1).
Article 5(1) was also violated in the case of Johnson v United Kingdom
(1996). In this case, the applicant had been convicted of a number of assaultsand, having been found to be suffering from mental illness within the MentalHealth Act 1983, was in 1984 ordered to be detained indefinitely. In 1989, theMental Health Review Tribunal decided that the applicant was no longersuffering from mental illness. However, since no suitable accommodation for

Versyp v Belgium (1971) (the vagrancy cases).

70 See, also, Van Droogenbroeck v Belgium (1982).

the applicant could be found, he was detained until 1993. That detention
violated the requirements of lawful detention.
The second group of requirements is that, where a person is arrested, that
person must be informed of the grounds for the arrest (paragraph 2), bebrought ‘promptly’ before a court of law and, moreover, is entitled to a trialwithin a reasonable time, or to be released on bail (paragraph 3).
71In Oldham v
United Kingdom (2001), the Court of Human Rights ruled that a two year delay
between Parole Board reviews was not reasonable, and that made continueddetention unlawful. There was a violation of Article 5(4) of the Convention.See also Hirst v United Kingdom (2001), in which the Court of Human Rights
ruled that where undue delays existed between reviews carried out by theParole Board, the lawfulness of the continued detention of a prisoner serving asentence of discretionary life imprisonment was not decided speedily asrequired by Article 5(4) of the Convention. The 21 and 24 month delaysviolated Article 5(4).
Article 5 was tested in Murray v United Kingdom (1995). The applicant
alleged a breach of Article 5 and a breach of Article 8, on the basis that she hadbeen detained by soldiers in Northern Ireland who suspected that they hadgrounds for arrest. Despite there being a period of a few hours between thetime of arrest and informing the applicant of the reason for arrest, this wasinsufficient to amount to a violation of Article 5.
72InBrogan v United Kingdom
(1989),73a challenge was lodged to the lawfulness of detention for up to seven
days, at the Home Secretary’s discretion, under the Prevention of Terrorism(Temporary Provisions) Act. The Court ruled that such detention representeda violation of the requirements of Article 5.
74
There was no contravention of Article 5 of the Convention in respect of a
person who had been arrested on reasonable suspicion of having committed acrime. The Court of Human Rights so held in O’Hara v United Kingdom (2001).
There was, however, a violation of Article 5(3), which guarantees the right tobe brought promptly before a judge, and a violation through the failure toaward compensation for the breach. 
In Benham v United Kingdom (1996),the Court of Human Rights ruled,  by a
majority of seventeen votes to four, that there was no violation of Article 5(1)of the Convention. Magistrates had committed Benham to prison for thirtydays pursuant to his failure to pay his community charge, the reason forwhich the magistrates found to be his culpable neglect. Benham had not beenlegally represented before the magistrates. On an application under theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
61271 See Wemhoff v Federal Republic of Germany (1979); Neumeister v Austria (1968); and
Stogmuller v Austria (1969).
72 There was also a finding that no violation of Article 8 had occurred. The arrest and
detention were justified under Article 8(2). See, further, below.
73 See, also, Brannigan and McBride v United Kingdom (1994).
74 The government in response issued a derogation notice and re-enacted the provisions.
See also Yagci and Sargin v Turkey and Mansur v Turke y (1995). 

The Protection of Human Rights
Convention alleging breaches of Articles 5 and 6, the Court ruled that, under
national law, the order was valid; that the detention was not arbitrary as themagistrates had not acted in bad faith or failed to apply the relevantlegislation. There was, however, a violation of Article 6 since, given thecomplexity of the legal issues and the fact that these were criminalproceedings, Benham should have been entitled to legal representation.
In Hussain v United Kingdom; Singh v United Kingdom (1996),the European
Court of Human Rights ruled that the United Kingdom had violated Article5(4) of the Convention. The applicants, who had been sentenced to bedetained during Her Majesty’s pleasure, were unable to have the lawfulnessof their continued detention reviewed by a court.
75
Articles 5 and 6 have also provided the basis for recent challenges in
relation to military proceedings in Hood v United Kingdom (1999) and Jordan v
United Kingdom (2000).76In Hood’s case, the applicant had been tried and
convicted of criminal charges under the Army Act 1955. The applicant’scommanding officer had decided on pre-trial detention, and had subsequentlyplayed a role in hearing the case against the applicant. Accordingly, he couldnot be impartial, and the proceedings did not meet the requirements ofindependence and impartiality required by Article 6(1). In Jordan’s case,
77the
applicant had completed a sentence of imprisonment, but continued to bedetained, under close arrest, on the basis of further suspected offences underinvestigation by military police. Jordan had been released following habeascorpus proceedings and had brought proceedings against the Ministry ofDefence, claiming unlawful detention. The commanding officer, who hadbeen involved in Jordan’s case since 1995, could not be considered impartial,and there was a violation of Article 5(3) and (5).
78
Provisions relating to the prosecution of juveniles for criminal offences
have also been subject to the scrutiny of the Court of Human Rights. In T and
V v United Kingdom (1999) ,the Court ruled that there were violations of Article
5(4) and one violation of Article 6(1). Two boys, aged ten when they killed atwo year old child, were convicted of murder. Following their conviction, theHome Secretary had set the tariff period to be served for retribution anddeterrence. Accordingly, there was no opportunity for the lawfulness of theirdetention to be assessed by a judicial body and, thereby, Article 5(4) wasviolated. In addition, the adult trial process, although specially adapted inlight of the defendants’ young age to reduce its formality, caused thedefendants stress and, thereby, violated the right to fair trial guaranteed byArticle 6.
61375 See, also, Curley v United Kingdom (2000).
76 See, also, Findlay v United Kingdom (1997).
77 See, also, Coyne v United Kingdom (1996), in which a court martial conducted before the
Armed Forces Act 1996 came into force was not an independent and impartial tribunal. 
78 See, now, the Armed Forces Discipline Act 2000.

ARTICLE 6
1 In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal
charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within
a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established bylaw. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public maybe excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, publicorder or national security in a democratic society, where the interests ofjuveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or tothe extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in specialcircumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.
2 Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until
proved guilty according to law.
3 Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum
rights:
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in
detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own
choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to
be given it free when the interests of justice so require;
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the
attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the sameconditions as witnesses against him;
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or
speak the language used in court.
Article 6 is the most frequently cited Article. Up to the end of 1989, 63
violations had been found. The protection given relates to the ‘determinationof ... civil rights and obligations’ and ‘of any criminal charge’. The Court hashad to determine the meaning and scope of these phrases. A ‘criminal charge’has been interpreted to mean ‘the official notification given to an individualby the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminaloffence’.
79
The phrase – ‘civil rights and obligations’ – has given rise to extensive
interpretation. The Article has been held to apply to proceedings before anadministrative tribunal – the Regional Land Commission – in Austria.
80As a
general principle, where the consequence of an administrative decision is onewhich affects the civil rights of individuals, then Article 6 may be held toapply.
81For example, in Konig (1980), Dr Konig’s licence to practise as a
doctor in his own clinic was withdrawn. The Court ruled that the decisionaffected Dr Konig’s civil rights and that, therefore, the protection of Article 6applied.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
61479Eckle v Federal Republic of Germany (1982), para 73.
80Ringeisen v Austria (1971).
81Konig v Federal Republic of Germany (1980).

The Protection of Human Rights
Article 6 was held to have been violated by the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland in relation to appointment to the Civil Service in Devlin v
United Kingdom ( 2001). The Secretary of State had issued a national security
certificate certifying that a refusal of employment was for the purpose of
safeguarding national security and public safety, which restricteddisproportionately the applicant’s right of access to a court. There was noevidence as to why the applicant was considered a security risk, nor was thereany independent scrutiny of the facts.
82
Particular difficulties arise in disciplinary proceedings for criminal
offences in the armed services. The consequence of trying the matter underdisciplinary regulations is to remove the normal application of Article 6. TheCourt has ruled that whether an offence is classified as criminal ordisciplinary is less important than the nature of the offence. In Campbell and
Fell v United Kingdom (1984), following involvement in a prison riot, the
applicants had been punished by the Board of Prison Visitors with loss ofremission of sentence. The Court held that Article 6 applied to the decisionmaking process of the Board of Visitors.
83
A ‘fair and public hearing’ has been interpreted to include the right to
legal advice before the judicial hearing. In Golder v United Kingdom (1975),
Golder, serving a prison sentence, wanted to sue a prison officer fordefamation. His request to the Home Secretary to consult a solicitor wasdenied. The Court held that Article 6 had been violated. The Court has furtherruled that not only must access to law not be impeded (by the denial of legaladvice or other means), but that the state has a duty to ensure effective accessto law.
84The right of access to law is not absolute, but any restrictions which
are imposed must not be such as to impair ‘the very essence of the right’.Limitations will be incompatible with the Convention, if they do not pursue alegitimate aim and are not proportional to the objective being sought.
85
Article 6(1) also requires that the hearing take place ‘within a reasonable
time’. The reasonableness of the length of the proceedings will depend upontheir complexity. 
The Court of Human Rights ruled that the United Kingdom authorities
had violated Article 6(1) in the case of Saunders v United Kingdom (1996). The
case concerned the prosecution of Ernest Saunders, formerly chief executiveofficer of Guinness plc, for corporate fraud. The investigating authorities(inspectors appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry) interviewedMr Saunders on nine occasions in 1987, using their powers under sections532(2) and 436(3) of the Companies Act 1985. By law, Mr Saunders wascompelled to answer questions put by the inspectors, under threat ofcontempt of court and the imposition of a fine or a prison sentence. In 1990,
61582 See, also, Devenney v United Kingdom (2002).
83 Cf Engel et al v Netherlands (1976).
84Airey v Ireland (1979).
85Ashingdane v United Kingdom (1985).

the applicant was convicted on 12 counts of conspiracy, false accounting and
theft. The Court ruled by a majority of 16 votes to four that there had been aviolation of the fundamental right not to incriminate oneself, as guaranteed byArticle 6(1). The public interest in combating fraud could not be allowed tooverride the defendant’s right not to incriminate himself.
86
In B and P v United Kingdom (1997), the Court of Human Rights ruled that
there was no violation of Article 6 through the denial of a hearing andpronouncement of judgment in public in child custody proceedings. Thehearings took place in chambers; the judge ordered that no documents used inthe proceedings should be disclosed outside the court. The right to a publictrial was not absolute, and could be overridden by the interests of children orthe need for privacy where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 
The right to legal advice was considered by the Court of Human Rights in
Magee v United Kingdom (2000). The applicant had been arrested in 1988 under
the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 and held formore than 48 hours without access to legal advice. He signed a confessionstatement at his seventh interview, and was only subsequently allowed toconsult his solicitor. The Court of Human Rights considered that the centralissue raised by the applicant’s complaint was that: ‘... he had been prevailedupon in a coercive environment to incriminate himself without the benefit oflegal advice.’ Although the right to legal advice is not expressly stated inArticle 6 and may be subject to restriction for ‘good cause’, the Court ruledthat there had been a violation of Article 6, stating that ‘to deny access to alawyer for such a long period and in a situation where the rights of thedefence were irretrievably prejudiced is – whatever the justification for suchdenial – incompatible with the rights of the accused under Article 6’.However, in the earlier case of Murray (John) v United Kingdom (1996),
87where
the applicant refused to give evidence at trial and adverse inferences weredrawn as a result, the Court ruled that there was no violation of Article 6.Unlike Magee’s case, where the only evidence against him was the confession,
in Murray’s case there existed a formidable body of other evidence against
him.
The right to silence was also considered in Condron v United Kingdom
(2000). In Condron, the applicants had been under police surveillance and were
charged with drug offences. When interviewed by the police, the applicants,acting on the advice of their solicitor who was concerned that their state ofwithdrawal from drugs made them unfit to answer questions, had remainedsilent, only offering ‘no comment’ to questions. The applicants were cautionedthat the jury could draw adverse inferences from their silence. At trial, theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
61686 See, also, IJL, GMR and AKP v United Kingdom (2000): the Court of Human Rights in
2000 had found a violation of Article 6(1) through the use of the applicants’ statements
at trial which they had been compelled under statute to give to inspectors appointed bythe Department of Trade and Industry. The Court awarded a total sum of £40,000 forcosts and expenses. See, also, Averill v United Kingdom (2000).
87 And see Munday, 1996.

The Protection of Human Rights
judge failed to give a proper direction to the jury on the correct approach to be
taken to the drawing of inferences. Nevertheless, on appeal the Court ofAppeal ruled that the convictions were safe. However, what the Court ofAppeal did not consider – which was of the essence of consideration beforethe Court of Human Rights – was whether the trial of the defendants was fair
in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention. The Courtruled that there was a violation of Article 6. The right to silence, according tothe Court, ‘lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure guaranteed byArticle 6’. Accordingly, the applicants did not receive a fair trial.
The Court ruled that there was a violation of Article 6. The defendants had
given evidence at their trial, and had explained that they had declined toanswer questions at interview on the advice of their solicitor. It was thefunction of the jury, properly directed, to decide whether or not to draw anadverse inference from the applicants’ silence.
88They therefore had a
discretion. However, the judge in his direction did not restrict that discretion,since he failed to advise the jury that it should only draw an adverse inferenceif it concluded that their silence was attributed to their having no answer tothe charges or none that would stand up to cross-examination. The right tosilence, according to the Court, ‘lies at the heart of the notion of a fairprocedure guaranteed by Article 6’. Accordingly, the applicants did notreceive a fair trial.
The presence of police officers within hearing during an accused’s
interview with his solicitor violated Article 6. The Court of Human Rights soruled in Brennan v United Kingdom (2001). However, Article 6 was not violated
by the deferral of access to the solicitor or in respect of police interviews. Theright to consult a solicitor had to be practical and effective. If it was not, thatcould undermine the right to fair trial: the presence of the police officer wouldhave prevented the applicant from speaking frankly.
The availability of free legal representation is essential to the fairness of a
trial, and denial of legal aid, where the interest of justice demand that itshould be made available, violates the Convention. In Granger v United
Kingdom (1990), for example, Granger was refused legal aid for his appeal
against conviction on a charge of perjury. The Crown was represented by theSolicitor General for Scotland and junior counsel, whereas Granger wasobliged to represent himself. The Court held that there was a violation ofArticle 6. Granger had no available remedy, and no right to make a freshapplication for legal aid once his original application had been rejected, andhe had no means to pay for representation.The denial of legal aid also resultedin a violation of the Convention in Benham v United Kingdom (1996). 
In addition to those cases alleging breaches of Articles 5 and 6
simultaneously, Article 6 has been subject to further scrutiny. The requirementof judicial impartiality was recently tested before the European Court of
61788 Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, s 34.

Human Rights, in a judgment which has implications for the role of Lord
Chancellor. In McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000), a case relating to the
position of the Deputy Bailiff of Guernsey as President of the States ofDeliberation, Guernsey’s legislative body, and subsequently as the sole judgeof law in proceedings relating to the applicant’s planning application whichhad been refused, the Court of Human Rights held that the Deputy Bailiff’sposition was ‘capable of casting doubt’ as to his ‘impartiality’ and, as a result,was in violation of Article 6(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights,which guarantees ‘a fair and public hearing ... by an independent andimpartial tribunal established by law’. On impartiality, the Court restated theproposition that:
... [the tribunal] must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias.
Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it mustoffer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect ...
In the instant case, there was no question of actual bias on the part of the
Bailiff; nevertheless, the Court considered that:
... any direct involvement in the passage of legislation, or of executive rules,
was likely to be sufficient to cast doubt on the judicial impartiality of a personsubsequently called on to determine a dispute over whether reasons exist topermit a variation from the wording of the legislation or rules at issue.
Accordingly, ‘the mere fact that the Deputy Bailiff presided over the court ...
was capable of casting doubt on his impartiality...’. There was, therefore, aviolation of the requirements of fair trial before an independent and impartialtribunal.
89
In Rowe and Others v United Kingdom (2000), the failure by the prosecution
to lay Public Interest Immunity Certificates before the judge in a trial formurder deprived the applicants of a fair trial, as required by Article 6. Thewithholding of evidence from the court breached the fundamental principlethat there should be ‘equality of arms’ between prosecution and defence.While there was no absolute right to disclosure, and the rights of the accusedmust be weighed against the interests of, inter alia, national security, it was for
the judge to control the release or otherwise of material.
90
Article 6 has been held not to be violated where state immunity had
prevented the applicants from pursuing cases in domestic courtproceedings.
91The three applicants each sought redress for the actions of
British, Kuwaiti and United States authorities for, respectively, an allegedassault, wrongful imprisonment and torture, and discrimination. Therespondent governments pleaded state immunity. The Court ruled that ineach case the doctrine of state immunity, designed to promote comitybetween nations, applied. Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
61889 See also Sander v United Kingdom (2001).
90 In CG v United Kingdom (2002), the Court of Human Rights ruled that excessive and
undesirable interruptions by a judge did not necessarily render a trial unfair.

The Protection of Human Rights
ARTICLE 7
1 No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or
omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or
international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavierpenalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time thecriminal offence was committed.
2 The article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for
any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, wascriminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilisednations.
It is an accepted presumption of statutory interpretation under English law
that parliament does not intend – in the absence of clear words – to legislatewith retrospective effect. Lord Reid’s observation in Waddington v Miah (1974),
to the effect that ‘it is hardly credible’ that parliament would passretrospective criminal legislation must now be seen in light of the War CrimesAct 1991 which does, however, have retrospective effect, making it a criminaloffence to have participated in war crimes during the Second World War.However, this Act would appear not to violate Article 7 of the Convention,given that such activities fall within paragraph 2 of Article 7, being crimesagainst the ‘general principles of law recognised by civilised nations’.
A challenge lodged under the Convention, claiming a violation of Article
7, for a penalty imposed which could not have been foreseen occurred inHarman and Hewitt v United Kingdom (1989). Ms Harman showed confidential
documents to a journalist after these had been read out in court, as a result ofwhich she was found guilty of contempt. Previously, no liability had beenimposed in such situations – the information had been regarded as havingentered the ‘public domain’ through disclosure in court. Ms Harman’sapplication was ruled admissible, but a friendly settlement was reached withthe government.
The European Court of Human Rights has ruled on the compatibility of a
conviction for marital rape with Article 7 of the Convention: SW v United
Kingdom; CR v United Kingdom . In R v R (1992), the House of Lords ruled that
the exemption of husbands from the law of rape against their wives wasobsolete. Two men were convicted of rape or attempted rape of their wives in1989 and 1990, following the decision in R v R. The applicants alleged that
their conviction amounted to a violation of Article 7 which prohibits aretrospective change in the criminal law. The Court ruled that the convictionsdid not violate the Convention: the judicial decisions had done no more thancontinue a line of reasoning which diminished a husband’s immunity; thedecisions had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the law andthe decisions were not in contravention of the aims of Article 7. A differentconclusion was reached in Welch v United Kingdom (1995). In Welch, the
applicant was awaiting trial for drug offences. Before the trial, the DrugTrafficking Offences Act 1996 came into force, under which there wasprovision made for confiscation orders. A confiscation order was made, even
619

though the provision was not in force at the time the applicant committed the
offences.
ARTICLE 8
1 Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home
and his correspondence.
2 There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this
right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a
democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or theeconomic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder orcrime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of therights and freedoms of others.
Article 8 has provided the legal means by which to challenge domestic law
and practice in two principal areas – the respect for privacy and non-intervention by the state (including the keeping of personal records), and therespect for the individual’s private life in terms of his or her own personalrelationships.
Respect for individual privacy
As can be seen from the text of Article 8, the right to privacy is subject toseveral exceptions, and the protection which can in fact be accorded to privacyis limited.
The interception of communications has given rise to challenges under the
Convention. For example, in Klass v Federal Republic of Germany (1978), lawyers
challenged German legislation which authorised the interception of mail andtelecommunications. The Court held that, whilst the right to privacy wasundoubtedly infringed, the interceptions were justified under paragraph 2 ofArticle 8. The Court ruled that any surveillance of citizens could be legitimateonly to the extent that it was necessary for ‘safeguarding the democraticinstitutions’ of the state. Provided that there exist adequate guarantees againstabuse, Article 8 was not violated. 
In Foxley v United Kingdom (2001),
92the Court of Human Rights ruled that
Article 8 was violated by the interception of correspondence which includedcorrespondence between the applicant and his solicitors. The legal basis forthe interception was the Insolvency Act 1986, under which a court ordered theredirection of the applicant’s mail to a trustee in bankruptcy. However, theintercepts continued after the expiry of the court order and involvedcommunications between the applicant and his lawyer. That was unjustifiedand violated Article 8.
In Malone v United Kingdom (1984) ,a different conclusion was reached by
the Court. The Court found that the law was unclear, and that, accordingly,‘the minimum degree of legal protection to which citizens are entitled underthe rule of law in a democratic society is lacking’ (paragraph 79). TheChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
62092 See, also, PG and JH v United Kingdom (2001).

The Protection of Human Rights
government’s response to the judgment was to introduce the Interception of
Communications Act 1985 (see Chapter 23), which places the granting ofwarrants for interception of communications on a statutory basis. In Kruslin v
France (1990) and Huvig v France (1990), the Court also ruled that insufficient
safeguards existed in law, and that the Convention was, accordingly,violated.
93
InX, Y and Z v United Kingdom (1997),94a female to male transsexual
applied to have his name registered on ‘his’ child’s birth certificate. The childhad been conceived after artificial insemination by donor. His application wasrefused, on the basis that a female to male transsexual was not a ‘man’ withinthe meaning of that term under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act1990. The Commission of Human Rights expressed the view that this positionviolates Article 8. See, now, Goodwin v United Kingdom (2002), at page 627 for
recent developments in the law.
In Halford v United Kingdom (1997), Alison Halford, a former Assistant
Chief Constable, won a significant victory in the European Court of HumanRights. Whilst in her post in Merseyside, Ms Halford’s telephone calls wereintercepted by senior police officers. Ms Halford applied under the EuropeanConvention, alleging a breach of her right to privacy, as guaranteed underArticle 8. Nine judges of the Court of Human Rights on 25 June 1997 ruledunanimously that there had been a violation of the Convention. The Courtalso ruled that domestic law provided no avenue for a complaint such as thisto be determined. Ms Halford was awarded £10,000 compensation. This caseraised, for the first time, the issue of the right to privacy of employees at work.Government lawyers had argued, unsuccessfully, that there was no protectionunder the Convention on the basis that the telephones which had been tappedwere government property. 
Covert surveillance by the police prior to the enactment of the Police Act
1997, which provided for statutory authority for such surveillance, violatedthe right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8. TheCourt of Human Rights so held in Khan v United Kingdom (2000). The applicant
had been convicted for drug dealing, on the basis of evidence improperlyobtained by a secret listening device installed by the police. The evidence sogained was the sole evidence against the accused. 
The applicant alleged that his trial was unfair and in breach of Article 6,
that his right to respect for private life under Article 8 had been breached andthat his right to an effective remedy under Article 13 had also been breached.On Article 6, the Court of Human Rights ruled that the applicant had hadample opportunity to challenge the use of the evidence and had done sobefore the trial court, the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, and that thedomestic courts had considered the question of admissibility. Accordingly,
62193 See, also, McLeod v United Kingdom (1999), discussed in Chapter 20.
94 See also AV v United Kingdom (1998); Leach, 1998.

there was no violation of Article 6. There was, however, a violation of Article
8. Since there was an absence of statutory authority for the intercept, theinterference could not be considered to be in accordance with law. 
On Article 13, the Court considered the avenues open to the applicant,
principally the police complaints mechanism. Having considered therespective roles of Chief Constables, the Police Complaints Authority and thatof the Home Secretary in relation to the appointment, remuneration anddismissal of members of the Police Complaints Authority, the Court ruled thatthe system of investigation of complaints did not meet the requisite standardsof independence needed ‘to constitute sufficient protection against the abuseof authority and thus provide an effective remedy’. Accordingly, there was aviolation of Article 13.
95
Privacy of the family
In Hoffman v Austria (1994) ,the Court ruled that Ms Hoffman had been
discriminated against (contrary to Article 14) and her respect for family lifeviolated (Article 8) by the Supreme Court of Austria, which had denied herthe custody of her children on divorce, principally because she had become aJehovah’s Witness. In Marckx v Belgium (1979), a complaint was lodged on the
basis that Articles 12 and 14 had been violated by discriminatory inheritancerules for illegitimate children.
96English law relating to care proceedings and
the powers of local authorities to control access of parents to children in localauthority care have also been successfully challenged under the Convention,leading to changes to the rights of parents to access to a court of law in orderto challenge a local authority’s decision to terminate contact between childrenand their parents.
97
The rights of Gypsies to live on their own land without planning
permissions was considered by the Court of Human Rights in Buckley v United
Kingdom (1997).98The Court ruled that the United Kingdom authorities had
not violated Article 8 or Article 14 (enjoyment of substantive rights withoutdiscrimination) of the Convention. Mrs Buckley had purchased land, and hadsought and been refused planning permission. 
The Court ruled, by a majority, that the protected right to a home may be
limited ‘in accordance with law’ as ‘necessary in a democratic society.’However, the Court ruled that the measures taken by national authoritiesmust be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Two dissenting judgesruled that there was a violation of Article 8 and one dissenting judge, thatthere had also been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention. There are aChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

number of Gypsy cases pending under the Convention and it is likely that the
Court will re-examine this issue in the foreseeable future. See also Chapman v
United Kingdom (2001), which followed Buckley in holding that there was no
violation of Article 8, but by a narrower majority of ten votes to seven.
In Hatton and Others v United Kingdom (2001), the Court of Human Rights
held that there had been a violation of Articles 8 and 13. The applicants alllived in properties in the area surrounding Heathrow Airport and complainedthat the increase in night-time noise interfered with their right to respect fortheir private and family lives and their homes, guaranteed by Article 8. Theyalso claimed that judicial review was not an effective remedy in that it failedto examine the merits of decisions by public authorities and was prohibitivelyexpensive for individuals. The state had failed to strike a fair balance betweenthe UK’s economic well being and the applicants’ effective enjoyment of theirrights. The Court also ruled that there was a violation of Article 13. Judicialreview, limited to concepts such as irrationality, unlawfulness and patentunreasonableness, did not allow consideration of whether the increase innight flights under the scheme represented a justifiable limitation on the rightto respect for private and family life. 
Issues relating to the relationship between parents and children are
increasingly coming under scrutiny. In G v United Kingdom (Minors: Right of
Contact) (2000), there was no violation of Article 8 with regard to the alleged
failure of the English and Scottish courts to enforce access arrangementsbetween the applicant and his children, following his wife’s refusal to complywith court orders. Compare TP and KM v United Kingdom (2001), in which a
violation of Articles 8 and 13 was held to have been committed by theauthorities. A mother and daughter had been separated for nearly a year bythe local authority as a result of allegations that the child had been sexuallyabused by the mother’s partner. The local authority had withheld evidencefrom the mother and failed to submit the issue to court, and had therebyexcluded the mother from the decision-making process.
99
Respect for private sexual life
In Dudgeon v United Kingdom (1982), the right to respect for privacy was
examined against the claim that legislation in force in Northern Irelandprohibited homosexual conduct between adult males. As a result, theHomosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982 was passed to bringdomestic law into line with the requirements of the Convention. See, also,Lustig-Praen and Beckett v United Kingdom and Smith and Grady v United
Kingdom (2000), in which the Court of Human Rights ruled that the ban on
homosexuals in the armed forces violated Article 8 of the Convention.
The prosecution and conviction of a man, for engaging in non-violent
homosexual acts in private with up to four other men, was a violation of
62399 The Court awarded each applicant £10,000 for non-pecuniary damage and £25,000 for
costs and expenses.

Article 8. The Court of Human Rights so held in ADT v United Kingdom (2000).
The Court ruled that the applicant was a victim of an interference with his
right to respect for his private life, both as to the existence of legislationprohibiting consensual sexual acts between more than two men in private,and as to the conviction for gross indecency. The interference was not justifiedas being ‘necessary in a democratic society’ in the protection of morals andrights and freedoms of others. 
ARTICLE 9
1 Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this
right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either
alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest hisreligion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
2 Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democraticsociety in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order,health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion have founded the basis for few
cases under the Convention. Applications which have been made under thisArticle relate primarily to the conditions under which an individual mayexercise his rights. In the case of prisoners detained following a criminalconviction, the prison authorities are entitled to prescribe limits to the exerciseof religious and other rights, simply because such restrictions represent ‘aninherent feature of lawful imprisonment’. In X v Austria (1965) ,refusal by
prison authorities to allow a Buddhist prisoner to grow a beard was held notto violate the Convention.
ARTICLE 10
1 Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include
freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas
without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. Thisarticle shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting,television or cinema enterprises.
2 The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictionsor penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democraticsociety, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or publicsafety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of healthor morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, forpreventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or formaintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
In a significant case relating to the responsibility of the state towards citizens
affected by industrial and manufacturing hazards, the Court of Human Rightsruled in Guerra v Italy (1998) that the failure of state authorities to advise
citizens of the threat posed by environmental pollution violated their right ofenjoyment of their homes in such a way as to affect their private and familylife adversely. Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
624

The Protection of Human Rights
Freedom of expression has given rise to several cases under the
Convention. In The Sunday Times v United Kingdom (1979), the English law of
contempt was considered in the light of Article 10. In 1972, The Sunday Times
published an article concerning children born deformed as a result of their
mothers taking the drug Thalidomide during pregnancy. The manufacturers,Distillers, were involved in pending court proceedings between the claimantsfor compensation. In October 1972, Distillers made representations to theAttorney General, claiming The Sunday Times article would prejudice
negotiations and would amount to contempt of court. The Attorney Generalsought and was granted an injunction. The Court of Appeal reversed thedecision but, in July 1973, the House of Lords confirmed the injunction. As aresult, The Sunday Times turned to Article 10.
At issue was whether Article 10, paragraph 2, justified the restriction of the
injunction. The Court held that Article 10(2) – since it limited freedom ofexpression – should be strictly construed and that no implied limits should beread into it. The English law of contempt, imposing a restriction of over threeyears, was ruled to be uncertain and unsatisfactory. The Court was required todecide whether the restriction imposed by the injunction was really necessaryin the circumstances and, moreover, whether the restriction was proportionateto the objective being sought. The government claimed that the law ofcontempt was a necessary device whereby the authority and impartiality ofthe judiciary was upheld. However, given that the trial was not in sight in1972 (when the injunction was granted) and that the authority of the judiciarywas unlikely to be at risk from journalistic articles, the restriction imposedviolated Article 10. As a result, the Contempt of Court Act 1981 was enacted,clarifying the law on pre-trial publicity.
100
The Court of Human Rights reached a different conclusion in Handyside v
United Kingdom (1976) ,101in which a publication entitled The Little Red
Schoolbook had been seized under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The
publishers claimed that the Obscene Publications Act represented a violationof Article 10 in several respects. The Court ruled there was no breach of theConvention. The ‘protection of morals’ clause in Article 10(2) entitled thegovernment to impose restrictions on freedom of expression, provided thatthe restrictions were proportional to the aim pursued. It was for the Court todecide whether the restrictions were necessary and sufficient. In this case, thebook was aimed at under 18 year olds and encouraged promiscuity.Accordingly, there was no violation of Article 10.
102
In Open Door Counselling and Dublin Well Woman v Ireland (1992), the Court
ruled that restrictions – an injunction – placed on the dissemination of any

UK(2000), discussed in Chapter 20.

information regarding the availability of abortion advice and treatment
represented an unlawful restriction and was therefore contrary to Article 10.
ARTICLE 11
1 Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of
association with others, including the right to form and to join trades union
for the protection of his interests.
2 No restriction shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such
as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in theinterests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorderor crime, or the protection of health or morals or for the protection of therights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the impositionof lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of thearmed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.
The right to a peaceful assembly is more limited than a right to assemble.
Where a state seeks to regulate assemblies which are not peaceful – or unlikelyto be peaceful – no violation of the right occurs.
The right to join a trade union has been interpreted to incorporate the right
not to join a trades union. In Young, James and Webster (1981) ,the Court
interpreted Article 11 to mean that there is a measure of choice left toindividual workers whether or not to join a trade union.
Deprivation of the right to be a member of a trade union was considered
by the Court in Council of Civil Service Unions v United Kingdom (the GCHQ
case) (1985) .
103It will be recalled that the Minister for the Civil Service, the
Prime Minister, had, following industrial unrest, by Order in Council ruledthat workers at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) wouldno longer be entitled to membership of a trade union. The ban was challengedby judicial review proceedings, which were ultimately unsuccessful in theHouse of Lords. The applicants argued that rights under Article 11 had beeninfringed, and also rights under Article 13, which provides for an effectivedomestic remedy. In answer, the government argued that the order wasjustified, inter alia, under Article 11(2) on the basis of the protection of national
security. The Commission found a clear violation of Article 11. However, theban on union membership was justifiable under Article 11(2) and thereforethere was no violation of the Convention.
In Wilson v United Kingdom (2002), the Court of Human Rights held that
financial incentives offered by employers to employees in exchange foremployees giving up trade union protection for collective bargainingpurposes violated Article 11. The applicants had applied to industrialtribunals, arguing that the requirement to sign contracts giving up their rightswas contrary to the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, section23(1)(a). Those proceedings culminated in the House of Lords, which ruledagainst them. The Court of Human Rights ruled that while the state was notdirectly involved, the responsibility of the state was engaged where it failed tosecure to the applicants the rights conferred under Article 11.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
626103 For further discussion of this case, see Chapters 6 and 23.

The Protection of Human Rights
ARTICLE 12
Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a
family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.
The right of transsexuals to marry has hitherto been denied by the Court of
Human Rights; see Rees v United Kingdom (1987) and Cossey v United Kingdom
(1992). In July 2002, however, in Goodwin v United Kingdom, the Court found
that English law, which prohibits transsexuals from marrying on the basis thata person’s sex determines gender identity for marriage purposes and cannotbe changed, violated both Articles 8 (the right to privacy) and 12. The Courtruled that the law placed transsexuals in a position where they could‘experience feelings of vulnerability, humiliation and anxiety’ and that the‘very essence of the Convention was respect for human dignity and humanfreedom’. On the right to marry, the Court held that the matter could not beleft entirely within the state’s margin of appreciation and there was nojustification for barring transsexuals from the right to marry. In the earlier caseof B v France (1992), the Court had ruled that French law violated Article 8, in
that official documentation could not be altered, thereby causing the applicantdistress and humiliation.
The right to marry and found a family does not entail a right to a
termination of marriage by divorce. In Johnston v Ireland (1987), the applicant
claimed that his right under Article 12 was violated by the governmentthrough its failure to provide for divorce in Ireland which would enable himto marry and found a family with the woman with whom he was now living.
Challenges have been lodged by prisoners denied the right to marry by
virtue of their imprisonment. In Hamer v United Kingdom (1981) and Draper v
United Kingdom (1978) ,the Commission ruled that it was for the individual –
and not governments – to determine whether he or she would enter intomarriage. However, the right of prisoners to marry does not entail a right toconjugal relations whilst in prison.
104
ARTICLE 13
Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are
violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authoritynotwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in anofficial capacity.
Article 13 imposes a duty on Member States to provide effective remedies for
any violation of the substantive rights protected by the Convention. Article 13has been interpreted to mean that an effective remedy before a nationalauthority is guaranteed to ‘everyone who claims that his rights and freedomsunder the Convention have been violated’.

627104X v United Kingdom (1975).
105Klass v Federal Republic of Germany (1978).

Judicial review106provides an effective means by which to ensure that
government complies with the requirements of the law.107In Klass v Federal
Republic of Germany (1978) ,the applicant argued, in relation to telephone
tapping, that there was no effective way in which to challenge the decision to
intercept communications and that the only method of control was through aparliamentary committee. The Court adopted the doctrine of margin ofappreciation and ruled that under the circumstances – where national securitywas involved – no better remedy could be given.
ARTICLE 14
The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be
secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour,language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
Article 14 provides for non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the substantive
rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. There is not, therefore, aright to non-discrimination per se but, rather, a right not to be discriminated
against in relation to any of the other rights and freedoms. Thus, Article 14enjoys no independent existence; it is tied to other Articles in theConvention.
108However, it is possible that a violation of Article 14 is found,
even where a claim that a breach of another Article has occurred fails. Forexample, in Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali (1985), three foreign wives
residing in England complained that their husbands were not allowed to enterinto the country. The applicants alleged a violation of Articles 8 and 14. TheCourt rejected the complaint concerning Article 8, adopting the view that theright to family life does not entail the right to establish a home wheresoeverpeople choose. However, there was a violation of Article 14, in so far as therules provided easier conditions under which men could bring in their wivesthan those which existed for wives trying to bring their husbands into thecountry.
109
ARTICLE 16
Nothing in Articles 10, 11 and 14 shall be regarded as preventing the High
Contracting Parties from imposing restrictions on the political activity ofaliens.
Article 16 affects all Articles in the Convention in so far as they relate to the
political activities of aliens. Article 16 does not mean that there can be noviolation of other substantive Articles in respect of aliens.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

ARTICLE 17
Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State,
group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimedat the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at theirlimitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.
According to the Commission, the purpose of Article 17 is to:
... prevent totalitarian groups from exploiting in their own interests theprinciple enunciated by the Convention ... Article 17 covers essentially thoserights which, if invoked, will facilitate the attempt to derive therefrom a rightto engage personally in activities aimed at the destruction of any of the rightsand freedoms set forth in the Convention.
110
Accordingly, convictions before a domestic court – as in the case of
Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v Netherlands (1982) – for possessing racially
discriminatory literature was not a violation of Article 10. The conviction wasjustified both by Article 10(2) and by Article 17 of the Convention.
The Convention protocols
In addition to the substantive Articles of the Convention, there exists a seriesof nine Protocols on matters ranging from the right to peaceful enjoyment ofpossessions (First Protocol, Article 1), education (First Protocol, Article 2), theholding of regular free elections (First Protocol, Article 3), freedom ofmovement (Fourth Protocol), abolition of the death penalty (Sixth Protocol),the rights of aliens and sexual equality (Seventh Protocol), procedural mattersunder the Convention (Ninth Protocol) and minority rights (Tenth Protocol).The United Kingdom is not a party to the Fourth, Sixth or Seventh Protocols.In relation to Article 2 of the First Protocol, the government has entered areservation to the effect that the rights of parents to determine the educationof their children are respected in the United Kingdom only to the extent thatsuch respect is compatible with the requirements of the Education Acts.
111
PART B: THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998
The incorporation of Convention rights into domestic law under the 1998 Actputs an end, finally, to the debate over whether or not to incorporate, whichhad endured for decades. That long-running debate focused on three principal
629110Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v Netherlands (1982).
111 On 4 November 2000, Protocol 12 opened for signature. The Protocol prohibits arbitrary
discrimination. The year 2000 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Convention. The
British Government intends to refuse to sign or ratify new protocol. Article 14, whichprovides that the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention are to be enjoyedwithout discrimination, is weak and there exists no free-standing right to non-discrimination. Protocol 12 introduces an independent right to equality, stating that the‘enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination, on anyarbitrary ground’.

concerns, namely the criticism that the Convention is outdated and not
tailored specifically to British conditions; that the judiciary was ill equipped toassume the mantle of guardian of individual rights in the face of executivepower and the concept of parliamentary sovereignty;
112and concerns over
the manner in which ‘incorporation’ would affect the conventional balance ofpower between judges and parliament. There was also the (unconvincing andpolitical) argument that the House of Commons, as the democratically-electedrepresentative of the people, was best equipped to respond to the betterprotection of rights.
The Act provides a charter of rights now enforceable before the domestic
courts. The effect of the Act is such that three avenues for challenging publicbodies arise. First, a failure to comply with Convention rights now forms thebasis for legal action; secondly, a new ground for judicial review has beenintroduced, namely the failure to comply with the Convention; and, thirdly,Convention rights may be used as a defence against actions brought by publicbodies against private bodies or individuals.
However, the manner in which the Act is drafted raises a number of issues
which give rise to some difficulties. These may be summarised as being:
• the meaning of ‘public authorities’ for the purposes of the Act;
• whether the Act has solely ‘vertical’ effect – binding only those bodies for
which the state is accountable to Strasbourg – or is capable of also having
‘horizontal’ effect, and being enforceable against bodies for which the stateis not accountable to Strasbourg;
• the extent to which judicial interpretative techniques relating to statutes
will change, and the extent to which the judges will develop the commonlaw to give effect to Convention rights.
As discussed in Chapter 7, under the constitution of the United Kingdom, andconsistent with the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, legislation cannotbe entrenched. That is to say, it cannot be given a ‘special’ or ‘higher’ statusthan other Acts of Parliament. This traditional doctrine has been preserved inrelation to the Human Rights Act. In its White Paper, the governmentannounced that it did not intend to permit the courts to strike down Acts ofParliament, whether that legislation preceded the Act or was introducedsubsequently. Thereby, parliament’s sovereignty and, to the extent possible,the separation of powers, is preserved. The Convention, in the government’sview, is ‘intended to provide a new basis for judicial interpretation of alllegislation, not a basis for striking down any part of it’.
113However, the courts
are given power over delegated, or secondary, legislation. Unless the parentAct stipulates that the courts do not have power to invalidate a piece ofsecondary legislation, its validity will depend on the court’s interpretation ofits compatibility with the Convention. Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
630112 See Griffith, 1997; but cf Lester, 1994 and 1997.
113 White Paper, Rights Brought Home: The Human Rights Bill , Cm 3782, 1997, London:
HMSO, para 2.14.

The Protection of Human Rights
Accordingly, section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires that
primary and secondary legislation, whenever enacted, must be interpreted
and applied in a manner consistent with Convention rights. However, section3(2) makes it clear that this requirement does not affect the validity,continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible primary legislation,and does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement ofincompatible subordinate legislation, if the primary legislation preventsremoval of the incompatibility.
Declarations of incompatibility are regulated under section 4, which
provides that, if a court is satisfied that a provision of primary or subordinatelegislation is incompatible with one or more Convention rights, it may make adeclaration of incompatibility. The courts with the jurisdiction to makedeclarations of incompatibility are the House of Lords, the Judicial Committeeof the Privy Council, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court; in Scotland, the HighCourt of Justiciary, sitting as a court of criminal appeal, or the Court ofSession; and, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the High Court orCourt of Appeal. Section 4(6), however, contains a vital limitation, in that adeclaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuingoperation or enforcement of the provision in question, and is not binding onthe parties to the proceedings in which it is made. 
As is evident from section 4, it is only the superior courts which have
jurisdiction to make declarations of incompatibility and, further, a declarationof incompatibility, as emphasised in sub-section (6)(a) and (b), the declarationwill have no effect on the validity of the primary legislation in question, norwill the declaration affect the legal position of the parties to the litigation.However, where the court finds a violation of a Convention right, it has thepower under section 8 to grant a remedy to the victim. See further below. Thepower to amend the law has thereby been preserved for parliament, althougha fast track legislative procedure, discussed below, will be employed tofacilitate rapid parliamentary action in relation to the declaration.
114
The definition of primary legislation is provided in section 21 of the
Human Rights Act 1998, which in part provides that primary legislationincludes any ‘public general Act, local and personal Act, private Act ... andOrder in Council made in exercise of Her Majesty’s Royal Prerogative’. It wasseen in Chapter 6 that Acts of Parliament have always been deemed to havesuperior force to acts of the prerogative,
115and that where a claimed
prerogative power is held to exist, if it is not expressly overruled by statute, itwill be held to be ‘in abeyance’ and the statute will prevail. The Human RightsAct 1998, however, appears to elevate Orders in Council to the same status asActs of Parliament, thereby making them immune from invalidation by thecourts. Accordingly, whereas the courts may set aside secondary legislation

Department ex parte Fire Brigades’ Union (1995).

which is incompatible with the Convention – unless the parent Act makes this
impossible – Orders in Council regulating the exercise of the prerogative maynot be so set aside.
116
The meaning of public authorities
The Human Rights Act 1998 provides that public authorities exercisingexecutive powers must comply with the requirements of the Convention. Asthe White Paper stated:
Although the United Kingdom has an international obligation to comply with
the Convention, there at present is no requirement in our domestic law oncentral or local government, or others exercising similar executive powers, toexercise those powers in a way which is compatible with the Convention. ThisBill will change that by making it unlawful for public authorities to act in away which is incompatible with the Convention rights. [ Rights Brought Home,
paragraph 2.2]
The European Convention imposes responsibilities on signatory states to
protect rights, and as such it is the state which is the defendant in allegationsof Convention violations before the Court of Human Rights. The state bearsliability for the failure of its agencies to protect rights. The emphasis on publicbodies/authorities under the Human Rights Act reflects this now traditionalform of state liability.
117
Section 6(3)(b) of the Act provides that a public authority includes ‘any
person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature’. The test,therefore is not state ownership, funding or control per se but rather the
functions which a body performs. The position is complicated by section 6(5)which provides that a person is not a public authority (applying the functionstest) ‘if the nature of the act is private’. Accordingly, the Act recognises thatsome authorities may, notwithstanding their ownership or control or fundingby the state, be public on the functions test, but will not be treated as publicbodies in relation to some actions which are deemed to be private. Anexample given in debate was that of Railtrack, which is a public authoritywhen exercising its function as a safety regulator, but acts privately in its roleas property developer.
118The Home Secretary in debate stated that the British
Broadcasting Corporation is a public authority but that independent televisioncompanies are not, whilst the Independent Television Commission is.
119
The definition of a ‘public body’ was considered by the Court of Appeal in
R (Heather and Another) v Leonard Cheshire Foundation (2002). The Foundation is
a private charity which provides accommodation for the disabled, some ofwhich is funded by the local authority pursuant to its statutory duty under theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

117 See Oliver, 2000.
118 See HC Deb Vol 314 Cols 406–414, 17 June 1998, and Col 1231 16 November 1997.
119Hansard Col 778, 16 December 1998.

The Protection of Human Rights
National Assistance Act 1948, as amended. The court made it clear that
residents of the home funded by the local authority could rely on theirConvention rights against the authority but not against the charity, since itwas not exercising public functions. Aside from the funding being providedby the state, there was no other evidence ‘of there being a public flavour to thefunctions of the foundation or the foundation itself. The foundation was notstanding in the shoes of the local authorities’.
120Compare Aston Cantlow and
Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank (2001), in which the
Court of Appeal ruled that a Parochial Church Council which had statutoryduties to enforce parish church repairs was a public authority for the purposesof the Human Rights Act. The Court ruled that its enforcement powersamounted, inter alia, to a distinctive form of taxation and did not meet the
requirements of Article 1 of the First Protocol. 
However, the classification of bodies (public or private) does not exhaust
the potential for the Act to develop the protection of Human Rights, becausethe courts themselves are public authorities and are under a statutory duty togive effect to Convention rights, and this raises the question of whether theAct has solely ‘ vertical effect’ or is capable of having ‘ horizontal effect’. Section 6
of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that a public authority includes acourt or tribunal,
121and proceedings against a ‘judicial act’ may be brought
by way of appeal or by an application for judicial review. Section 6accordingly requires that the courts act compatibility with Convention rights,and does not limit that duty to either the interpretation of statutes or to theactions of public bodies. In respect of the common law the Lord Chancellor indebate stated that:
... it is right as a matter of principle for the courts to have the duty of acting
compatibly with the Convention not only in cases involving other publicauthorities but also in developing the common law in deciding cases betweenindividuals. Why should they not?
122
In Professor HWR Wade’s view, which is controversial, this is ‘a clear
statement in favour of horizontal effect’. Arguing for horizontality, Wadecontinues that it ‘... will eliminate such problems [as to the definition of publicauthorities] altogether, since Convention rights will take effect against publicbodies and private persons equally, thus saving a great deal of litigation’(2000, p 223). In Murray Hunt’s analysis (1998), the issue is not so clear-cut,nor a choice between a purely vertical or purely horizontal approach, butrather that there is a spectrum of positions between the two extremes, theessential question being where along this line of possible positions the courts
633120 See also Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association Ltd v Donoghue (2001), in
which a housing association performing functions analogous to the local authority was
a public authority for the purposes of the Act.

122Hansard 583 HL Deb 783, 24 November 1997. And see Irvine (Lord), 1998, in which the
Lord Chancellor stated that ‘the Convention rights must pervade all law and all courts
systems’ (at p 232).

will set the standard. It is clear from section 6 that the Act does not intend
directly to confer enforceable Convention rights between two private parties:direct horizontal effect is thereby precluded. However, the duty on the courts,under section 6(3)(a), tends to the conclusion that indirect horizontal effect ispossible.
123The manner in which the courts are dealing with this issue is
illustrated by recent case law. 
The interpretative duty: section 3
In the exercise of the interpretative duty under section 3 of the Human RightsAct 1998, the courts have rapidly adapted to the approach of the Court ofHuman Rights in employing the concepts of proportionality and necessity,which give greater scope for the protection of rights than the conventionalconcepts employed in judicial review under the umbrella of the Wednesbury
124
unreasonableness test, which spans ‘illegality, impropriety and proceduralirregularity’. Even before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into effect, thecourts were developing a more vigorous approach to the protection of rights.In R v Ministry of Defence ex parte Smith (1996), it was recognised that in judicial
review proceedings, where human rights were in issue, the courts should‘anxiously scrutinise’ executive decisions. That approach, however, did notsatisfy the interpretative duty according to Lord Steyn in R (Daly) v Secretary of
State for the Home Department (2001), in which he stated that while there was an
overlap between the traditional Wednesbury grounds for review and the
proportionality approach, there was nevertheless ‘a material differencebetween the Wednesbury and Smith grounds of review and the approach of
proportionality applicable in respect of review where Convention rights are atstake’.
Convention rights, section 3 and statute125
Section 3 of the Human Rights Act requires the courts to interpret primaryand subordinate legislation in a way which is compatible with Conventionrights, ‘so far as it is possible to do so’.
126The House of Lords in R v A
(Complainant’s Sexual History) (2001)127gave guidance as to the correct
approach. At issue was whether the statutory restrictions on the admissibilityof evidence prejudiced the right to fair trial.
128The Court ruled that it first had
to consider whether a legislative provision interfered with a Convention right.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
634123 There is an analogy here with Article 10 of the EC Treaty, which the Court of Justice has
used to great effect in extending the liability of Member States. See, further, Chapter 9.

125 See Klug and Starmer, 2001.
126 See Bennion, 2000.
127 On the joinder of the Home Secretary under section 5 see R v A (2001).
128 Under consideration was the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s 41(3)(c),
which precluded evidence and questioning about a complainant’s sexual history in an
attempt to redress the problems of low conviction rates and outmoded stereotypes ofwomen.

The Protection of Human Rights
If there was an interference, then the court had to look at the legislative
purpose of the provision and employ the concept of proportionality. Threeissues had to be considered:
• First, was the legislative objective sufficiently important to justify limiting
a fundamental right?
• Secondly, were the measures adopted to meet that objective rationally
connected to it?
• Thirdly, the court must be satisfied that the means used to impair the right
or freedom were no more than necessary to accomplish the objective (the
proportionality test). 
Section 3 of the Human Rights Act ‘went further than requiring the court totake the Convention into account: the court had a duty to strive to find apossible interpretation compatible with Convention rights’. Lord Steyn statedthat this might even require the courts ‘to adopt an interpretation which mayappear linguistically strained’.
129
Moreover, the courts could imply a right to appeal where Convention
rights demanded such a course of action. For example, in R v Lichnial; R v
Pyrah (2001), the Court of Appeal ruled that although there was no right to
appeal against a sentence that was fixed by law, the court nevertheless hadjurisdiction under section 3(1) of the 1998 Act to hear such an appeal if thestatutory provision which required the imposition of such a sentence wasincompatible with the Convention. A mandatory life sentence imposed onconviction of murder in accordance with section 1(1) of the Murder (Abolitionof Death Penalty) Act 1965 was not incompatible with Articles 3 and 5 of theConvention.
The limits of interpretation
Strive as the judges may to interpret statutes compatibly, there are limits. First,it is clear that the 1998 Act is not retrospective. For example, in R v Kensal (No
2) (2001), the House of Lords ruled that it should follow its previous decision
notwithstanding that a majority of the House now believed the precedent caseto have been wrongly decided. Note, however, that this case involved a pre-Human Rights Act precedent. The respondent had answered questions undercompulsion, and was convicted under the Theft Act 1968 and Insolvency Act1986. The case was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal CasesReview Commission on the basis that, following the passing of the 1998 Act,there was a real possibility that the admission of evidence acquired undercompulsion was a breach of Article 6. Lord Slynn was not ‘persuaded’ that theprecedent relied on in Lambert (2001) was wrong. If parliament had intended
convictions valid before the Act came into force to be re-opened on the basis
635129 See also R v Ashworth Special Hospital Authority ex parte N (2001) and R v Secretary of State
for the Home Department ex parte Mellor (2001), discussed below.

of rights conferred by the 1998 Act, it would have said so clearly. By section
22(4) of the Act, section 7 applies to proceedings ‘brought by or at theinstigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place; butotherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before thecoming into force of that section’. Lord Lloyd stated that there was no doubtthat Lambert decided that the 1998 Act was retrospective in respect of
proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority, but not inrespect of appeals in those proceedings. The House of Lords (sitting as a panelof five judges) in Kensal was divided on whether Lambert was correctly
decided. However, the reasons advanced for departing from Lambert ‘fell
short of the sort of compelling considerations necessary to justify theirLordships departing from so recent a decision’. Lord Hutton stated that ‘therewere strong reasons of policy, grounded in the need for certainty in the lawand finality in litigation, why a conviction which was valid and lawful at thetime it took place should not be set aside because of a change in thesubstantive law brought about by legislation’.
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Mahmood (Amjad)
(2001), the Court of Appeal also considered the question of the effect of theHuman Rights Act 1998 on decisions taken before the date of itsimplementation which came into effect after its implementation. The Courtruled that while it was not required to judge the decision by reference to itsconformity with the affected individual’s fundamental rights by regardingthem as incorporated into domestic law, nevertheless, the court, in reaching adecision in public law involving a fundamental right before the date ofimplementation of the 1998 Act, should require the decision maker todemonstrate that his proposed action did not interfere with the right, or if itdid, that ‘considerations existed which might reasonably be accepted asamounting to a substantial objective justification for the interference’.
130
In Pearce v Governing Body of Mayfield School (2001), the Court of Appeal
considered the issue of gender orientation in relation to discrimination underthe Human Rights Act 1998. Disruptive pupils abused a lesbian teacher at theschool in the early 1990s. Such conduct was not discriminatory under the SexDiscrimination Act 1975. Since the Human Rights Act was not in force at thetime of the conduct in question, the applicant could not seek compensationunder that Act.
In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Wainwright and Another
(2002), the Court of Appeal affirmed that there was no tort of invasion ofprivacy at common law, and that because the conduct complained of occurredin 1997, before the Human Rights Act came into force, section 3(1) of the ActChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
636130 The applicant had entered the United Kingdom illegally in 1994, had been married for
less than two years to a woman settled in the United Kingdom and had two children by

The Protection of Human Rights
did not apply to introduce a right to privacy retrospectively. Mrs Wainwright
and her son had been strip-searched by prison officers,131having been told
that they were under suspicion of bringing drugs into the prison whenvisiting an inmate. They consented to the searches. The county court judgeruled that the tort of trespass to the person had been committed and awardeddamages. The claimants relied on section 3 of the 1998 Act, arguing that oncethe Act was in force the court had the duty to comply with it even though thematters complained of took place before the Act came into force.
132The Lord
Chief Justice stated that the 1998 Act could not change substantive law byintroducing a retrospective right to privacy which did not exist at commonlaw. 
The second limitation lies in the distinction between legitimate
interpretation and the ‘redrafting’ of statutes. For example, in In re W and B
(Children: Care Plan) (2002), the Court of Appeal considered the interpretive
duty and held that the duties of local authorities under the Children Act 1989should be subject to a system of ‘starred milestones’ which requiredauthorities to implement care plans within time limits. No such provision hadbeen made by parliament in the Children Act. Lord Nicholls ruled that section3 of the 1998 Act maintained the constitutional boundary betweeninterpretation by the courts and the enactment and amendment of statutes byparliament, and that an interpretation of an Act which departed from anessential feature of an Act of Parliament was likely to have crossed theboundary. Here, parliament had entrusted local authorities with responsibilityfor looking after children in care. The House of Lords ruled that the Court ofAppeal’s interpretation went beyond the boundary of interpretation andexceeded its judicial jurisdiction.
In R v Saunders, Parnes, Ronson and Lyons (2002), the Court of Human
Rights had ruled that there had been a violation of Article 6.
133Article 46 of
the Convention provides that states undertake to abide by the final judgmentof the Court of Human Rights. On a reference from the Criminal CasesReview Commission, the Court of Appeal ruled that it could not set aside theconvictions as being unsafe because the procedures were expressly permittedby parliament (under section 434 of the Companies Act 1985). Section 3, per
Lord Woolf CJ, does not authorise the judges to legislate, but only to interpretin order to render a statutory provision consistent with Convention rights.
134
However, although the line between legislating and interpreting may appearto be fine, it is nevertheless understood by the judges.

Convention rights, interpretation and common law
While section 3 does not refer to common law, as seen above, the Act requires
that the common law be developed consistently with Convention rights, andsection 6, which includes courts and tribunals as public bodies, underpins thejurisdiction. Development of the common law has been seen most clearly inrelation to privacy, which engages three issues. First, there is no common lawright to privacy: as Glidewell LJ stated in Kaye v Robertson (1991), ‘It is well-
known that in English law there is no right to privacy’. Secondly, privacyrights under common law derive from a relationship of confidence and breachof that confidentiality. Thirdly, Article 8 protects privacy rights in relation tofamily life, the home and correspondence. In Venables v News Group
Newspapers Ltd (2001), an injunction was granted which prevents, indefinitely,
the media from revealing the identity and whereabouts of the applicant.Butler-Sloss LJ recognised that the defendant newspapers were not within thedefinition of public authorities, but nevertheless asserted that the court – as apublic authority – must itself act compatibly with the Convention. Article 8 ofthe Convention thus prevailed over Article 10 (freedom of expression) andwas applied against a private body. Similarly, in Campbell v MGN Ltd (2002),
the High Court developed the law of breach of confidence in a manner whichrestricted the press from unauthorised disclosure of details of treatmentundertaken by the model Naomi Campbell and awarded her damages,thereby in all but name recognising a right to privacy which is enforceableagainst non-public bodies. On this, see further Chapter 20.
It is already clear from the early case law that the doctrines of
proportionality and necessity have been accepted as judicial tools for theenforcement of Convention rights. In R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department (2001), for example, in the House of Lords, in declaring the prison
policy of requiring prisoners to leave their cells for the purpose of searches,including the search of privileged legal correspondence, unlawful, LordBingham of Cornhill stated that his conclusions had been reached ‘on anorthodox application of common law principles’ but stated that the sameresult would yield by reliance on the Convention. However, he recognisedthat this coincidence between common law and Convention might not alwaysoccur. Lord Steyn was more explicit regarding the requirements ofproportionality. Citing Lord Clyde in de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing (1999), Lord Steyn declared
that the criteria to be applied are ‘more precise and more sophisticated thanthe traditional grounds of review’, and that under the proportionalityapproach, ‘... the intensity of review is somewhat greater’. Where there hasbeen an infringement of a right, it must be established that the limitation ofthe right ‘was necessary in a democratic society, in the sense of meeting apressing social need, and the question whether the interference was reallyproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued’.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
638

The Protection of Human Rights
Section 5 of the Human Rights Act
Section 5 of the Human Rights Act 1998 confers the right on a minister to be
heard. The purpose of section 5(2) was to ensure that the appropriate ministerhad an opportunity to address the court on the objects and purposes of thelegislation in question and any other matters which might be relevant. In R v
A (Joinder of Appropriate Minister) (2001), the House of Lords ruled that where
an issue was raised in criminal proceedings which might lead to the House ofLords considering making a declaration of compatibility, it was appropriate tojoin the Crown in advance of the appeal hearing. Where the Crown wasalready represented by the Director of Public Prosecutions, his role asprosecutor was different from that of a government minister in the dischargeof executive responsibilities. The House granted the application for joindermade by the Home Secretary, who bore responsibility for promotion of thelegislation in question. 
Declarations of incompatibility
As has been noted above, where the superior courts135are unable to interpret
statutes in a manner which makes them compatible with Convention rights, adeclaration of incompatibility may be issued. This puts the government andparliament ‘on notice’ that the statute requires amendment. 
A declaration of incompatibility was made by the Court of Appeal in R (H)
v Mental Health Review Tribunal, North and East London Region and Another(2001). At issue was Article 5 of the Convention, which guarantees the right toliberty and the right to take proceedings to determine the lawfulness ofdetention. The applicant was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983,section 73 of which provides, inter alia, that in order to satisfy a mental health
review tribunal that he was entitled to discharge, the burden of proof fell onthe restricted person to show that he was no longer suffering from a mentaldisorder warranting detention. Section 73 could not be given an interpretationwhich was compatible with the Convention.
In Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) (2001), the Court of Appeal made a
declaration of incompatibility under section 4(2) in relation to section 127(3) ofthe Consumer Credit Act 1974. Section 127(3) of the 1974 Act contained aninflexible prohibition against the making of an enforcement order in a casewhere a loan agreement signed by the debtor did not include the prescribedterms. That prohibition meant that there could be no fair and public hearingby an independent and impartial tribunal and excluded a judicial remedy. Theexclusion of any remedy engaged not only Article 6 but also Article 1 of theFirst Protocol, which requires a balance to be struck between the rights of anindividual to enjoy possessions and the public and general interest. Theinflexible prohibition was unnecessary and disproportionate. 
639135 The High Court and above.

In Matthews v Ministry of Defence (2002), the Queen’s Bench Division ruled
that the Crown’s immunity from action in respect of claims by members of the
Armed Forces under section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 wasincompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.
136The ‘all-embracing nature of
section 10 meant that it was not rationally connected to the limited objective itwas intended to achieve, and the limitation placed on the right of access to thecourts was more than reasonably necessary to accomplish that objective’.Section 10 did not satisfy the test of proportionality. It could not be interpretedin such a way as to make it compatible with Convention rights. 
Compare R (Alconbury Developments Ltd and Others) v Secretary of State for
Environment, Transport and Regions (2001) ,where the House of Lords ruled that
the Secretary of State’s power to make decisions on planning applications wasnot incompatible with Article 6. Such decisions were subject to judicial reviewwhich ensured compatibility of the overall procedures. The decision overturnsthat of the High Court, which had ruled that the processes by which theSecretary of State made decisions relating to planning matters
137were
incompatible with Article 6(1) of the Convention.138 The minister’s powers,
the High Court ruled, conflicted with the requirements of an independent andimpartial tribunal because the minister was also responsible for the formationof planning policy.
Making an application under the Act
Section 7(3) of the Act provides that an individual may make an application tothe courts if, and only if, he or she ‘is, or would be, a victim of an unlawfulact’. A person claiming that a public authority has acted, or proposes to act, ina way made unlawful by section 6(1) may bring proceedings against theauthority, or may rely on the Convention right concerned in any legalproceedings. In relation to judicial review proceedings, the victim test is alsoapplied, giving a narrower meaning to ‘sufficient interest’ (or ‘standing’) thanthat applied under other judicial review proceedings. 
The definition of standing follows the approach of the Court of Human
Rights. A victim or potential victim has standing, as does a person who, whilenot the immediate victim of an alleged violation, is nevertheless affected. Anexample is a family member of a person deported or threatened withChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
640136 Section 10 was repealed by the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 save in
relation to injuries suffered prior to that date.
137 Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Transport and Works Act 1992,
the Highways Act 1980 and the Acquisition of Land Act 1981.
138 The Queen’s Bench Divisional Court had made a declaration of incompatibility but held
that the Secretary of State had not acted unlawfully under s 6(1) of the Act (which
makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with Convention rights)because of s 6(2) which provides that s 6(1) does not apply to an act where the publicauthority could not have acted otherwise because of primary legislation, or where suchlegislation could not be interpreted to make it compatible with Convention rights.

The Protection of Human Rights
deportation where this violates the Article 8 right to family life. The position
of third parties who are not directly affect is more complex and gives rise todiffering tests to be applied depending on the type of proceedings beingbrought. The sufficient interest – or standing – requirements in judicial reviewproceedings allow ‘public interest’ organisations to bring proceedings. Helpthe Aged, the Child Poverty Action Group and the Joint Council for theWelfare of Immigrants have all been taken to have standing.
139Standing for
the purposes of the Human Rights Act, however, excludes interest groupsunless they can establish that their members are actual or potential victims.Interest groups whose members are not victims, but who have specialexpertise in an area (for example, environmental groups such as Greenpeaceor Friends of the Earth), will not have standing. They will, however, bepermitted to make submissions to the court on matters within their expertise.In debate, the Lord Chancellor, referring the practice before the Court ofHuman Rights, stated that ‘... our courts will be ready to permit amicus written
briefs from non-governmental organisation; that is to say briefs, but not totreat them as full parties’, and further that ‘... I dare say that the courts will beequally hospitable to oral interventions, provided that they are brief’.
140
Proceedings must be brought within one year of the date on which the act
complained of took place, but this limit may be extended by the court if itconsiders it ‘equitable’, having regard to any stricter time limit imposed on theproceedings in question (section 7(5) of the Act). ‘Legal proceedings’ isdefined to mean proceedings brought by a public authority and appealsagainst the decision of a court or tribunal (section 7(6)).
Remedies 
Article 13 of the Convention, which provides that everyone shall have aneffective remedy before a national authority, has not been incorporated.Instead, section 8 of the Human Rights Act regulates remedies. Section 8provides that, where a court finds that a public authority has actedunlawfully, it may grant ‘such relief or remedy, or make such order within itsjurisdiction as it considers just and appropriate’. Accordingly, courts andtribunals may only award a remedy which is within their statutory powers.
Damages may only be awarded by a court which has power to award
damages or to order the payment of compensation in civil proceedings, andno award of damages is to be made unless, taking into account all thecircumstances of the case and any other relief or remedy available, the court issatisfied that the award is necessary to afford just satisfaction to the
641139 See R v Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council ex parte Help the Aged (1997); R v Secretary of
State for Social Security ex parte Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (1997); and R v
Lord Chancellor ex parte Child Poverty Action Group (1998).
140Hansard HL Deb Col 834, 24 November 1997.

complainant. The court must take into account the principles applied by the
Court of Human Rights in relation to the award of compensation underArticle 41. However, the full range of remedies – declarations, injunctions andthe prerogative orders of certiorari (quashing orders), mandamus (mandatory
orders) and prohibition (prohibitory orders) – are also available to those courts
and tribunals with the power to grant them. 
One question which arises is the issue whether or not section 8 provides an
adequate remedy according to the jurisprudence of the European Court ofHuman Rights.
141The courts are under a duty, under section 2, to take into
account the case law developed in Strasbourg. Accordingly, there is thepotential for considerable case law on the relationship between section 8 of theHuman Rights Act 1998 and Article 13 of the Convention.
The adequacy of judicial review as a remedy was considered by the Court
of Human Rights in Kingsley v United Kingdom (2002). There, the Gaming
Board had revoked the applicant’s licence. Seeking leave to apply for judicialreview, the applicant claimed that the Board was biased against him. TheHigh Court ruled, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, that even if there hadbeen some form of bias, the decision on the licence had to be taken by theBoard because there was no other body with jurisdiction to make the decision,and that as efforts had been made to minimise the effect of any potential bias,the decision could not be impugned for bias. The Court of Human Rightsruled that the Gaming Board did not present the ‘necessary appearance ofimpartiality’ and that ‘the subsequent judicial review was not sufficientlybroad to remedy that defect’. The clear implication of this decision is that sincejudicial review is concerned with the procedural correctness of decisionmaking, rather than the merits of the decision itself, where there is noalternative decision maker which satisfies the requirements of impartialityand independence under Article 6, judicial review cannot be regarded as anadequate remedy. As discussed in Chapter 25, however, it should be notedthat the courts are developing judicial review in a manner which appears toextend its scope beyond the traditional pre-Human Rights Act limitations. 
Ensuring legislative conformity with Convention rights 
Ensuring that domestic legislation conforms to Convention requirementsinvolves two procedures. The first relates to the enactment of legislationgenerally, and the second relates to legislative action taken after a declarationof incompatibility has been issued by the courts. 
In relation to non-remedial legislation, the Act provides for declarations to
be made to parliament that the proposed legislation conforms to Conventionrequirements. Section 19 requires that a minister in charge of a Bill in eitherHouse of Parliament must, before second reading, make a statement either toChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

643the effect that a Bill does comply with Convention rights or that, although
such a statement cannot be made, the government nevertheless wishes toproceed with the Bill.
In relation to remedial legislation, the courts are not given the power
under the Act to invalidate or set aside primary legislation which isincompatible with Convention rights. Instead, the power to reform the law ispreserved for the executive and parliament. The Act introduces a speciallegislative procedure for reform. While this mechanism preserves theprinciple that it is parliament, as the democratically elected legislature, whichis sovereign in making and reforming law, it also opens the door to thepossibility that governments of differing political persuasions may react withgreater or lesser enthusiasm to declarations of incompatibility. The extent towhich successive governments respond to the ruling of the courts thus lies inthe moral rather than legal authority of the Convention. 
The fast track legislative procedure
Where a higher court142makes a declaration of incompatibility, or where the
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg declares that the Convention has beenviolated, the relevant government minister will have power to enactamending legislation by Order in Council (a ‘remedial order’). Other thanwhere it is necessary for the Order to have immediate effect, the Order will besubject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament, and will only come intoeffect once approval has been secured. Section 10 and Schedule 2 regulateremedial action and remedial orders. 
Section 10, which was considerably amended in Standing Committee in
the House of Commons, provides for the amendment of legislation to make itcompatible with Convention rights. The remedial procedure can be usedeither following a declaration of incompatibility or in response to a decision ofthe European Court of Human Rights, whether or not the decision in questionrelated to United Kingdom law. Two procedures are provided for. Under thestandard procedure,
143a draft of the order must be laid before parliament for
a 60 day period before it is approved by resolution of each House. Whenlaying the draft instrument, the minister must also provide the ‘requiredinformation’, which entails an explanation of:
... the incompatibility which the proposed order seeks to remove, including
particulars of the court declaration, finding or order which caused the ministerto propose a remedial order; and a statement of the reasons for proceedingunder section 10 and for making an order in the terms proposed.
144
During the period in which the draft is laid before parliament, representations
may be made to the minister, either by parliament or by any other person. If
142 As interpreted by the Human Rights Act 1998, s 6.
143Ibid, Sched 2.
144Ibid, Sched 2, para 3.

representations are made, the draft must be accompanied by a statement
containing a summary of the representations and details of any changesintroduced into the proposed order as a result of the representations.
145
Section 10 and Schedule 2 also provide that, if a minister considers that thereare compelling reasons, he may make such amendments to legislation as heconsiders necessary to remove the incompatibility, by means of a statutoryinstrument. The power applies to both primary and subordinate legislation. Indebate on the Bill, the Lord Chancellor stated that, ‘if legislation has beendeclared to be incompatible, a prompt parliamentary remedy should beavailable’.
146
Derogations and reservations
The Human Rights Act 1998 makes provision for derogations andreservations. Sections 14 to 17 regulate designations and reservations. Section14, in part, provides that the Secretary of State has the power to make‘designation orders’ in anticipation of a proposed derogation fromConvention Articles.
147Following the terrorist attacks in the United States of
America in September 2001, the Home Secretary made an Order148regarding
derogation from Article 5(1) of the Convention, which guarantees the right toliberty. The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 provides for anextended power of arrest and detention in relation to foreign nationals whohave been certified by the Secretary of State as a risk to national security and asuspected international terrorist.
149This measure is regarded as one which is
‘strictly required by the exigencies of the situation’. The measure is initially inforce for a 15 month period, after which it expires unless renewed byparliament. Thereafter it will be subject to annual renewal by parliament. Thederogation was necessitated by the Court of Human Rights’ ruling thatdetention with a view to deportation is not permissible save wheredeportation proceedings are conducted with ‘due diligence’ and withoutundue delay.
150Considering that the extended powers are incompatible with
obligations under Article 5(1), the government decided to derogate untilfurther notice.
In relation to reservations, section 15 provides in part that:
(1) In this Act, ‘designated reservation’ means:
(a) the United Kingdom’s reservation to Article 2 of the first protocol to
the Convention [the right to education in conformity with parents’
religious and philosophical convictions]; andChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Case law under the Human Rights Act 1998
While there have been few declarations of incompatibility, there have been
numerous challenges under the 1998 Act, both successful and unsuccessful.‘Catalogues’ of cases briefly digested are inherently unsatisfactory. It is,however, important to appreciate the scope of the Act as applied in its earlyyears.
Article 2: the right to life
A court making a declaration of lawful withdrawal of treatment in a casewhere a patient was in a permanent vegetative state does not infringe theright to life. The Court applied the principle established in Airedale National
Health Trust v Bland (1993) in NHS Trust A v M; NHS Trust B v H (2001). In the
high profile case of Diane Pretty, the victim of motor neurone disease whowas paralysed, the House of Lords ruled, inter alia, that Article 2 was directed
towards protecting the sanctity of life and did not entail a right to terminateone’s own life.
151Where there was a serious risk to life to former soldiers
through their giving evidence before a tribunal enquiring into the shootings inNorthern Ireland on ‘Bloody Sunday’, the Court of Appeal ruled that theevidence should be given elsewhere.
152
Article 3: freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment
Article 3 to date has given rise to challenges against prison conditions and theimposition of a life sentence on a mentally ill offender. In Napier v The Scottish
Ministers (2001), the Court of Session ruled that Article 3 was violated by the
conditions in prisons. The court ordered the executive to transfer the applicantto conditions of detention which complied with Article 3. There was noinfringement of Article 3 or 5 through the imposition of a life sentence on amentally ill offender rather than the making of a hospital order. The Court ofAppeal (following the approach taken in R v Offen, below) so held in R v Drew
(2002), in which the offender presented a serious and continuing danger to thesafety of the public and a hospital order would not have ensured adequatesecurity.
645151R (Pretty) v Director of Public Prosecutions (2001). Mrs Pretty subsequently lost her appeal
to the Court of Human Rights.
152 In R (A and Others) v Lord Saville of Newdigate (2001).

Article 5: the right to liberty
Article 5 has been employed to test the compatibility of an automatic life
sentence imposed on a defendant who had committed two serious offencesand the Court of Appeal ruled that if the offender was a significant risk to thepublic the court could impose a life sentence under section 2 withoutcontravening the Convention.
153In Anderson and Others v Scottish Ministers
(2001),the Privy Council ruled that the continued detention of mental patientson grounds of public safety did not infringe Article 5 of the Convention, evenwhere there was no medical treatment for the condition. The House of Lordsin R v Leeds Crown Court ex parte Wardle (2001) ruled that continued detention
in custody where the accused was charged with a second offence while incustody on the first charge did not infringe the Convention. The fresh timelimit was justified by the need to give the prosecutor sufficient time to preparethe evidence relating to each offence.
In Regina (C) v Mental Health Review Tribunal (2001) the Court of Appeal
ruled that the listing of all hearings by the Mental Health Review Tribunal in auniform specified period after a request for review had been made wasunlawful in that it did not ensure that individual applications were heard assoon as reasonably practicable. 
In In re K (A Child) (Secure Accommodation Order: Right to Liberty) (2000) the
Court of Appeal ruled that a secure accommodation order, while adeprivation of liberty, was justified as ‘being detention of a minor by lawfulorder for the purpose of educational supervision’ under Article 5(1)(d). 
Article 6: the right to fair trial
As expected, Article 6 has generated a wealth of case law. It is clear that thecourts are following the approach of the Court of Human Rights in lookingless at detailed irregularities in trial procedures and more to the overallfairness of the criminal process. Where there are alleged defects in the process,the courts will only rule that a violation of Article 6 has occurred where thecumulative effect is to render the trial unfair. Furthermore, where there aredefects identified, if these are remedied by the appeal process, or throughjudicial review proceedings, then the courts will be slow to find a violation ofConvention rights. On a general point of principle, the Court of Appeal statedthat the law had ‘moved on and had received a decisive impetus towards amore case-specific approach with the advent of human rights’.
154Article 6
comprises a number of rights relating to differing aspects of judicial decisionmaking. Issues considered under the Human Rights Act include thefollowing.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
646153R v Offen and Others (2000). At issue was the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, under which
an automatic life sentence could be imposed on a defendant who had committed two
serious offences.
154McNally v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police (2002).

The Protection of Human Rights
Disclosure of informants’ identity
When considering whether to disclose whether a person was a police
informer, the court had to balance the need to protect the informer and therequirements of fair trial. The court would not be constrained by precedentwhich identified possible exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure.
155
Substantive issues and Article 6 protection
Article 6 does not apply where a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence isaccused of breaching prison rules. That is not a criminal charge and thereforethe guarantees of Article 6 do not apply.
156Also, Article 6 does not apply to
proceedings relating to an accused’s fitness to plead.157The applicants had
argued that Article 6 applied because it was unfair to try someone under adisability which prevented him from participating in proceedings because of amental handicap. The Court of Appeal stated that the proceedings could notresult in a conviction and therefore the argument failed. 
Child law and the powers and duties of local authorities in relation to
housing law have also given rise to challenges. The Court of Appeal has heldthat secure accommodation orders against children, although not criminalproceedings, attracted rights to fair trial.
158
Temporary judges
Article 6 was also invoked in Millar v Dickson, Payne v Heywood, Stewart v Same
and Tracey v Same (2001). There, the defendants were tried by temporary
sheriffs. The decision follows that of Starrs v Ruxton (2000), where it was held
that temporary sheriffs were not an independent and impartial tribunalwithin the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The right to fair trial was ofthe utmost importance to citizens. By continuing prosecution of the accusedbefore temporary sheriffs, the Lord Advocate had violated the right of theaccused to the protection of Article 6. 
The position of the Lord Chancellor has again come under question, most
particularly in relation to the judicial appointments system. In Starrs v
Procurator Fiscal, Linlithgow (1999), the issue of an impartial tribunal was
tested. It should be noted that this case arose in Scotland, where the HumanRights Act 1998 was already in force at the time. The challenge arose over theposition of temporary sheriffs, appointed by the Lord Advocate, who holdoffice for one year renewable terms ‘at pleasure’ and who enjoy no security oftenure. The High Court of Justiciary ruled that the appointment system andlack of security created a situation of ‘dependence’, which was ‘objectionable’and contrary to the fundamental requirement of judicial independence fromthe executive, of which the Lord Advocate is a member. Accordingly, the

157R v M, R v Kerr, R v H (2001).
158In re M (2001).

appointment system was contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention,
which requires a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal. 
The case raises questions about both the Lord Chancellor’s powers of
appointment over magistrates and part time recorders in England and Walesand his disciplinary powers. The system of appointment to the judiciary isalso under question. While defending the current system, Lord Irvine of Lairghas also indicated that a judicial appointments commission, involvinglaypersons, may be needed to ensure greater openness in the system.
Article 6 was also examined by the High Court of Justiciary in Hoekstra v
Her Majesty’s Advocate (2000). In that case, the right to an impartial tribunal
was violated by a judge sitting in a case of criminal appeal, who wrote anewspaper article strongly critical of the Convention. The article, which inter
aliasuggested that persons suspected of drug dealing should not have the
right to privacy (under Article 8) against covert surveillance, would create inthe mind of an informed observer ‘an apprehension of bias’ on the part of itsauthor against the Convention and its rights. The court ordered that freshappeal proceedings should be heard by three different judges. 
In Scanfuture UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; Link v Same
(2001), the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that new procedures forappointing lay members of employment tribunals meant that they were nowcompliant with the Convention. Previously, they had contravened provisionsguaranteeing the right to fair trial where the Secretary of State had an interest.The role of the Secretary of State in the appointment of members of thetribunal gave rise to concerns other than their independence and impartiality.That defect had now been cured.
159
Evidence
The question of admitting evidence of previous sexual relations at trial camebefore the Court of Appeal in R v A (No 2) (2001). The giving of such evidence
is prohibited except with the leave of the court.
160It was argued that this
restriction was incompatible with Article 6. The House of Lords ruled, inter
alia, that the relevant section could be construed as permitting evidence where
to exclude it would endanger the fairness of the trial.161
In R v Botmeh, R v Alami (2001) ,the Court of Appeal ruled that there was
nothing ‘unlawful or unfair’ in the court considering an ex parte application to
withhold evidence on the ground of public interest immunity where thatevidence had not been subject to a public interest immunity application to theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
648159 See also Director of Public Prosecutions v Wilson (2001).
160 Under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.
161 In R v A (Sexual Offence: Complainant’s Sexual History) (2001), the Court of Appeal gave
leave to the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal, and certified a point of law of
general public importance, namely whether the exclusion of evidence relating to asexual relationship under s 41 represented a contravention of the defendant’s right tofair trial.

The Protection of Human Rights
trial judge. The court ruled that the defence had no absolute right to disclosure
of relevant evidence and that ‘strictly necessary measures restricting the rightsof the defence were permissible, provided they were counterbalanced byprocedures followed by the judicial authority’. In Atlan v UK (2001), the Court
of Human Rights had ruled that the Court of Appeal’s review of evidence notavailable to the trial judge was insufficient to remedy the unfairness at trialwhere the judge had not scrutinised the evidence. However, the Court ofAppeal ruled that this did not apply to an ex parte examination of material. 
The Court of Appeal in R v Looseley (2001) ruled that an accused’s right to a
fair trial was not prejudiced by admitting evidence obtained through the useof undercover police officers. At the start of his trial, the accused alleged thatthe police officers had incited him to commit the offence. The correct test was:
... whether the officers did no more, whether than by active or passive means,
than to afford the accused the opportunity to offend of which he freely tookadvantage in circumstances where it appeared that he would have behaved ina similar way if offered the opportunity by someone else; or whether, on theother hand, by means on unworthy or shameful conduct, they had persuadedhim to commit an offence of a kind which otherwise he would not havecommitted. 
That approach was consistent with Article 6.
Remedial proceedings
In Taylor v Lawrence (2002), the Court of Appeal ruled that if it was established
that a significant injustice had occurred, the court could re-open an appeal
after its final judgment had been delivered and there was no alternativeremedy. When the alternative remedy would be an appeal to the House ofLords, the Court of Appeal could only re-open a case where it was satisfiedthat no leave to appeal would be given by the House of Lords. 
In R (Beeson) v Dorset CC (2001), the Queen’s Bench Division ruled that a
decision taken by a panel comprising one independent member and twocounty councillors was not an independent tribunal for the purpose ofdetermining a claim to financial assistance for care arrangements. That defectcould be remedied by the appointment of a totally independent panel.Although disciplinary procedures of the General Dental Council and GeneralMedical Council did not meet the requirements of impartiality andindependence, any defect is cured by the right to appeal to the PrivyCouncil.
162
Similarly, defects at trial which were capable of being reviewed by the
Court of Appeal did not violate Article 6.163The Court of Appeal has also
considered the procedures under the Housing Act 1996 in relation to decisionsas to the suitability of accommodation for the homeless and declared that the
649162Preiss v General Dental Council (2001); Ghosh v General Medical Council (2001).
163R v Smith (Joe) (2000); R v Craven (2001).

right to appeal to the county court, which granted full jurisdiction to that
court, satisfied the requirements of the ‘developing domestic law of humanrights’.
164Article 6 was considered in tandem with Article 8 (right to respect
for private and family life) by the Court of Appeal in St Brice v Southwark
London BC (2001). The court ruled that where a local authority, acting on a
possession order granted by a county court, evicted a tenant without notice, itdid not infringe the tenant’s rights under the Convention. Those rights hadalready been protected by the hearing in the county court. 
Time lapses in proceedings
On the reasonableness of time lapses between charge and trial, the Court ofAppeal in Dyer v Watson; HM Advocate v K (2002) ruled that it would be a
breach of Article 6 for a boy charged with serious sexual offences when aged13 to be tried some 28 months later, when he would be a youth of 16.However, a delay of 20 months between charging police officers with perjuryand the date of trial was not such a delay as to violate Article 6. 
The fixing of a penalty by tax commissioners in relation to a defaulting
taxpayer amounted to the determination of a criminal offence and Article 6 ofthe Convention applied. The Chancery Division of the High Court so ruled inKing v Walden (Inspector of Taxes) (2001). Accordingly, the taxpayer was
entitled to have his case determined ‘within a reasonable time’. Here therewas a delay of five years, which the court stated was ‘marginally, but onlyjust’ acceptable. Such matters should in future be dealt with more speedily.Article 6 applies to the determination of civil penalties pursuant to criminalcharges brought under the Value Added Tax Act 1994 and the Finance Act1994.
165
In Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 2001) (2001), the Court of Appeal
ruled that, in considering whether a criminal charge had been determinedwithin a reasonable time for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, therelevant time normally started to run when the defendant was charged by thepolice or served with a summons, rather than when he was first interviewedby the police. 
A violation of Article 6 also arose in R v Her Majesty’s Advocate (2000),
where a nine month delay between an original interview of a suspect and thesuspect being charged rendered a prosecution unlawful. The delay had beenunreasonable and contrary to Article 6(3). 
Equality between defence and prosecution
The Court of Appeal has ruled that the equality of arms between prosecutionand defence in criminal proceedings did not require representation of theChapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
650164Runa Befum v Tower Hamlets LBC (2002).
165Han and Yau t/a Murdishaw Supper Bar and Others v Commissioners of Customs and Excise

The Protection of Human Rights
defendant by Queen’s Counsel merely because the Crown was so
represented.166In R v Weir (2001) ,the House of Lords ruled that it had no
power to extend the time allowed for a prosecutor to apply for leave to appealfrom the Court of Appeal. The right to fair trial guaranteed under Article 6 didnot require that the prosecution be given an equal right to the defence: that‘would stand the Convention on its head’. 
The presumption of innocence
Making the assumption that property or expenditure by a person convicted ofa drug trafficking offence was the proceeds of drug trafficking was notincompatible with the presumption of innocence: HM Advocate v McIntosh
(2001). Admitting, under statutory compulsion, to being the driver of a motorvehicle did not violate the right not to incriminate oneself, provided theoverall fairness of trial was not compromised: Brown v Stott (2001). The
reversal of the burden of proof in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 did notcontravene Article 6, given the powers of review held by the Court of Appeal:R v Benjafield, Leaf, Rezvi and Milford (2000). 
Compatibility with Article 6 requirements also fell for consideration in
Brown v Procurator Fiscal, Dunfermline (2000), in relation to self-incrimination.
There, a police officer who suspected a person of driving while drunkrequired him to say whether he had been driving his car. The response ‘it wasme’, and evidence of that reply, was given to the court by the prosecution on acharge of driving whilst drunk. That evidence violated the driver’s right tosilence and rights against self-incrimination under Article 6. The relevantstatutory provision, section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, had to beinterpreted subject to the requirements of Article 6. 
Miscellaneous issues relating to fair trial
In R v Stone (2001), the Court of Appeal ruled that the right to fair trial was not
inevitably denied by publicity. See also R v Williams (2001) and R v Francom
(2000) ,in which defective summing up to a jury did not violate the right to fair
trial unless that defect would have had the effect of altering the jury’sdecision. 
Article 6, in conjunction with Article 8, does not impose a general and
unqualified obligation on local authorities to remedy housing defects.
167
The Home Secretary’s role in the fixing of the tariff period necessary for
retribution and deterrence, before which a mandatory life sentence prisonercould be considered for release on licence, was considered by the Court ofAppeal in R (Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R (Taylor) v
Same (2001). The court recognised the distinction drawn between the setting of
tariffs for prisoners serving discretionary life sentences, detention during HerMajesty’s pleasure and mandatory life sentences. In relation to the two former

Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
652cases, the Home Secretary’s role had breached Article 6(1) of the
Convention,168and the House of Lords ruled that the distinction between the
different categories was one embedded in primary legislation. However, thecase of Stafford had founded an application to the Court of Human Rights.
While the Court of Appeal in Anderson and Taylor did not expect the
distinction to survive the Court of Human Rights’ decision in Stafford, it
declined to act in advance of such a ruling. The Court of Human Rights ruledon Stafford v United Kingdom in May 2002: the Home Secretary had no power
to keep murderers in prison once the Parole Board had decided that theycould be safely released. The Parole Board had ruled that Mr Stafford could bereleased, a decision which the Home Secretary had overruled. The decisionpaves the way for the reconsideration of a number of cases where the HomeSecretary has insisted that murderers be kept in jail for life. The Court ofHuman Rights considered that the Home Secretary’s powers wereincompatible with the doctrine of separation of powers.
169
Article 7: the prohibition against retrospectivity
In Gough and Another v Chief Constable of Derbyshire and Others (2001), the
Queen’s Bench Division ruled that banning orders which prevented UKnationals from leaving the country in order to attend regulated internationalfootball matches were lawful and a proportionate restriction on freedom ofmovement under EC law. Further, such an order imposed after a conviction ofa public order offence was not a penalty and there was no violation of Article7 of the Convention.
Article 8: the right to privacy
The Convention right to privacy, discussed here, must also be considered inrelation to freedom of expression, with which it may conflict. It will be seenfrom the case law on Article 10, discussed in Chapter 20, that the restrictionsimposed on freedom of expression are having the effect of substantiallypromoting privacy, at least when considered within the context of protectionfrom intrusion by the media. As can be seen from the following, Article 8 hasbeen invoked in relation to mental patients, prisoners, the evidence ofdefendants in criminal proceedings, planning law and the making ofpossession orders over a home. It has also been raised in matters relating todeportation orders and electoral law.
168V v United Kingdom (1999). In relation to mandatory life sentences, see R v Secretary of
State for the Home Department ex parte Stafford (1999).
169Practice Statement: Life Sentences , 4 June 2002 replaces the term ‘tariff’ with ‘minimum
term’. The sentencing judge should indicate the appropriate determinate sentence
suitable for punishment and retribution. He should then calculate the minimum term tobe served before the prisoner’s case should be referred to the Parole Board. Differingconsiderations apply to adult and juvenile cases.

The Protection of Human Rights
Mental patients
In R v Ashworth Special Hospital Authority and Another ex parte N (2001), the
High Court ruled that the right to privacy was not violated through the
random monitoring of telephone calls of mental patients classified as havingdangerous, violent or criminal propensities. Provision had been made togather information on escape plans, disturbances and arrangements to bringin illicit substances, threats to others and behaviour presenting securityimplications. There was evidence that patients were likely to abuse the use oftelephones unless prevented from doing so. Random monitoring interferedwith Article 8 no more than was necessary to achieve the permitted purpose. 
Prisoners
The House of Lords considered both common law and Article 8 of theConvention in R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001). It
was Home Office policy that prisoners should be required to leave their cellsduring searches conducted by prison officers. The search included thescrutiny of privileged legal correspondence. The House of Lords ruled that thepolicy infringed the common law right to legal professional privilege incommunications with legal advisers. On Article 8, the Court ruled that thepolicy interfered with Article 8. Lord Bingham stated that:
... the policy interfered with Mr Daly’s exercise of his right under Article 8(1) to
an extent much greater than necessity requires. In this instance, therefore, thecommon law and the Convention yield the same result ...
Article 8 was invoked alongside Article 12 (the right to marry and found a
family) in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Mellor (2001). A
prisoner, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, claimed that he wasentitled to facilities to enable him and his wife to have a child, through the useof artificial insemination. The Court of Appeal ruled that imprisonment wasincompatible with the exercise of conjugal rights and that the restrictions inArticle 8(2) applied. The restrictions were necessary for the maintenance ofsecurity in prison. Prisoners inevitably forfeited aspects of their rights. It didnot follow, however, that prisoners would always be prevented frominseminating their wives artificially, or naturally. The interference with thefundamental human rights in question involved an exercise inproportionality. Exceptional circumstances could require the restriction toyield. In this case however, they did not. 
Evidence
The question of the admission of illegally obtained evidence into court wasconsidered in R v Loveridge and Others (2001). In that case, contrary to section
41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925, the police had filmed defendants at amagistrates’ court in order to compare the pictures with pictures previouslytaken by closed circuit television cameras, in order to link the defendants to arobbery. The Court of Appeal ruled that the filming had been unlawful and inbreach of Article 8. However, their Lordships were satisfied that the breach of
653

Article 8 did not interfere with the fairness of the hearing. The appeals against
conviction were dismissed. In R v (1) X (2) Y (3) Z (2000), the Court of Appeal
ruled that there was no violation of Article 8 through the admission ofevidence resulting from telephone intercepts lawfully made according to thecountry in question. Although such evidence of the result of intercepts madein the United Kingdom would not be admissible by virtue of the Interceptionof Communications Act 1985, that did not preclude the admission of evidencefrom outside the United Kingdom.
InR (P) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and R (Q) v Same (2001),
the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court upheld the policy of the Prison Servicethat children should cease to live with their mothers in prison at 18 monthsold as lawful. 
Article 8 was held by the Queen’s Bench Division not to be violated
through the retention by the police of fingerprints and DNA samples ofsuspects after they had fulfilled the purpose for which they had been taken: R
(S) v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (2002).
Planning law and possession orders
In South Buckinghamshire District Council v Porter, Chichester District Council v
Searle, Wrexham Borough Council v Berry and Hertsmere Borough Council v Hartyand Others (2001), the power to issue injunctions to restrain the breach of
planning control was in issue in relation to Gypsies and the right to respect fortheir home and family life. In an unusually sympathetic decision in relation toGypsies, the Court of Appeal ruled that the power to grant the injunctionshould not be used to evict Gypsies from their mobile homes unless the needfor such a remedy to protect the environment outweighed the Gypsies’ rightsunder Article 8. The precedents, Mole Valley DC v Smith (1992), Guildford BC v
Smith (1994) and Hambleton DC v Bird (1995), could not be considered
consistent with the court’s duty under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act1998 to act compatibly with Convention rights. Proportionality required notonly that the injunction be appropriate and necessary for the attainment of thepublic interest objective sought, but also that it did not impose an excessiveburden on the individual whose private interests – here the Gypsy’s privatelife and home and the retention of his ethnic identity – were at stake. Gypsyrights were also at issue in Clarke v Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (2001). In this case, the Queen’s Bench Division ruled
that in deciding whether to grant planning permission to a Gypsy to station acaravan on land for his residential use it could be a breach of Articles 8 and 14(the right to enjoyment of Convention rights without discrimination) to takeinto account the fact that he had refused the offer of alternative, conventional,housing accommodation as being contrary to his culture as a Gypsy. Themaking of a possession order of a dwelling house, which a court was obligedto make if the statutory criteria were satisfied, did not contravene the tenant’sright to family life and home. The Court of Appeal so ruled in Poplar Housing
and Regeneration Community Association Ltd v Donoghue (2001).Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Protection of Human Rights
655Electoral law
Article 8 of the Convention was violated by the refusal of an electoral
registration officer to allow an elector to have his name removed from anelectoral register before that register was sold to a commercial firm formarketing purposes. The Queen’s Bench Division so held in R (Robertson) v
Wakefield Metropolitan District Council and Another (2001). No provision had
been made in the Representation of the People (England and Wales)Regulations for the editing of the register following requests to be excludedand this breached the EC Directive. Article 8 was violated, since the sale of theregister to marketing organisations raised the foreseeable infringement of aperson’s privacy.
170
Deportation
InR (Samaroo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001), the Court of
Appeal ruled that where the decision had to be made whether to deport aperson on the grounds of the prevention of crime and disorder (in this caseconviction for importing Class A drugs), a fair balance had to be struckbetween the legitimate aim and the affected person’s fundamental rights. TheSecretary of State was entitled to regard drug trafficking as very serious andthere was no violation of Article 8. In R v Secretary of State for the Home
Department ex parte R (2000), the Queen’s Bench Division ruled that it would
be a breach of an unsuccessful asylum seeker’s right to family life to removehim from the United Kingdom while his wife and children remained, and thatit would be disproportionate to do so on the ground that he had criminalconvictions in the United Kingdom. The court accepted the Home Secretary’sundertaking not to take any steps to remove the claimant until his wife’sapplication had been determined.
Article 9: freedom of religion, etc
Article 9 was not violated by the prohibition in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971in relation to the supply of cannabis which it was claimed was for use in actsof religious worship (Rastafarianism). The Court of Appeal so held in R v
Taylor (Paul Simon) (2001). In R (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and
Employment, the Queen’s Bench Division ruled that a genuine belief in
corporal punishment in schools was not a manifestation in practice orobservance of a religion or belief. Nor was it a religious or philosophicalconviction for the purposes of the right to education in Article 2 of the FirstProtocol.
170 In addition, there was a failure by domestic law to comply with EC Directive 95/96/EC
of October 24 1995, OJ 1995 L281/3l which required that an individual could object to
the processing of personal data which the data controller anticipated would beprocessed for the purposes of direct marketing.

Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law
656Special considerations apply to the position of religion and the churches.
Section 13 of the Act provides for freedom of thought, conscience and religion,
and states that:
13(1) If a court’s determination of any question arising under this Act might
affect the exercise by a religious organisation (itself or its members
collectively) of the Convention right to freedom of thought, conscience andreligion, it must have a particular regard to the importance of that right.
The section was included to protect the churches from liability under the
Convention. Thus, for example, if a person alleges that he or she is the victimof a breach of the Convention right to marry (Article 12) or the right to respectfor private and family life (Article 8) by the beliefs, rules and practices of areligious faith, the court, in determining the issue, must have special regard tothe importance of those beliefs and practices.
Article 10: freedom of expression
Freedom of expression is subject to the limitations set out in Article 10(2).Those restrictions prevailed in R (Farrakhan) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department (2002), which justified the exclusion of the Islamic leader on
grounds of public policy.
The House of Lords upheld the right of prisoners to freedom of expression
in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Simms; Same v Same ex parte
O’Brien (1999). The court ruled that an indiscriminate ban on all visits to
prisoners by journalists or authors in their professional capacity was unlawful.A prisoner had a right to seek, through oral interviews, to persuade ajournalist to investigate his allegations of miscarriage of justice in the hopethat his case might be re-opened. The Court of Appeal had allowed an appealby the Secretary of State from the decision of the High Court, granting judicialreview of the Home Secretary’s decision that the applicant could receive visitsin prison from journalists only if the journalists signed written undertakingsnot to publish any part of the interviews, as laid down in the Prison Rulesissued by the Home Secretary. The applicants were serving life sentences formurder and, having had their renewed applications for leave to appealagainst conviction turned down, continued to protest their innocence. TheHome Office had adopted a blanket policy that no prisoners had a right to oralinterviews with journalists. Lord Steyn stated that the applicants wished tochallenge the safety of their convictions, and that, ‘in principle, it was not easyto conceive of a more important function which free speech might fulfil’. HisLordship was satisfied that it was administratively workable, and consistentwith prison order and discipline, to allow prisoners to be interviewed for thepurpose here at stake. The Home Secretary’s policy and the governor’sadministrative decisions pursuant to that policy were unlawful.

The Protection of Human Rights
Freedom of expression and the right to privacy (Article 8) are capable of
colliding with one another. Developments in the law relating to privacy are
significant, with the courts extending the common law of confidence in linewith Article 10 to provide, in all but name, a right to privacy, the existence ofwhich has always been denied under common law.
171Freedom of expression
is also inextricably linked to freedom of association, discussed below.
Article 11: freedom of association
Article 11 was considered in Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals v Attorney General and Others (2001). The Chancery Division ruled that
the RSPCA had the right to exclude applicants whom the Society thought ingood faith were likely to damage its objectives. In question was the right of theSociety to exclude current members and deny membership to applicants whosought to reverse the Society’s policy against hunting with dogs. However,fairness dictated that a large charity such as this could not adopt an arbitraryprocedure which gave no right of reply to a potential applicant. The RSPCAhad sought a declaration that its Council be permitted to adopt a new policyon membership which would enable it to remove and/or exclude frommembership those who opposed its policy, and the introduction of anadministratively convenient scheme for the implementation of that policy. Thecourt ruled that the Society should adopt a procedure through which anypotentially excluded person should have the opportunity to makerepresentations.
Protocol 1: the right to enjoyment of possessions
The Court of Appeal in Lindsay v Commissioners of Customs and Excise (2002)
ruled that the policy of seizing motor vehicles of those who evaded duty ontobacco and alcohol, and refused to restore the vehicle save in exceptionalcircumstances, fettered the discretion of officers. It failed to distinguishbetween commercial smuggling and importation for distribution amongfamily and friends. Under Article 1 of Protocol 1, deprivation of possessionscould only be justified if it was in the public interest. There had to be areasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed andthe aim pursued. Here there was not.
A child’s right to education under Article 2 of Protocol 1 to the Convention
was not violated by enforcement of immigration control which involved theremoval of a child settled in a school in England after her parents’ applicationto remain in the United Kingdom had been rejected. The Court of Appeal soheld in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Holub and Another
(2001). Article 2 did not confer a right to education in any particular countryand was accordingly limited in scope.
657171 See the discussion in Chapter 20.

CONCLUSION
The European Convention on Human Rights has provided vital protection for
citizens against the power of the state. As has been seen, the case law againstthe United Kingdom is substantial and, in many instances, has led toconsiderable reform of the law. Nevertheless, the right of individual petition,conferred in 1965, meant long delays and high costs for litigants. TheConvention has for the most part, and despite its limitations in scope, servedindividuals well in the protection of fundamental rights. The incorporation ofConvention rights into domestic law was a logical step forward for agovernment seriously committed to individual rights and freedoms.Incorporation may also change the traditional public conception of individualfreedoms in favour of rights, and bring a greater clarity to the law relating toboth civil liberties and human rights. It may be argued that the manner of theConvention rights’ incorporation is deficient: that it represents ‘half a loaf’ byallowing for express repeal and for the retention of legislative control by theexecutive and parliament. Perhaps, however, to state the obvious, half a loaf isbetter than none. 
In the third edition of this text, it was noted that the effectiveness of the
Human Rights Act 1998 rests on three foundations: the willingness of thejudges robustly to defend rights and to interpret Convention rights in amanner favouring individual protection against governmental encroachment;parliament’s willingness to amend the law to ensure compliance withdeclarations of incompatibility with Convention rights; and, finally, theenergy with which individual citizens are prepared to assert their rights incourts of law. Within two years of the Human Rights Act coming into effect, itcan be seen that its impact is reaching swiftly into numerous areas of law.Chapter 19: Constitutional and Administrative Law

CHAPTER 20
The common law proved inadequate to protect individuals against
discrimination on the basis of either race or sex. Parliament intervened,passing originally the Race Relations Act 1965 (now the Race Relations Act1976) and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as subsequently amended). Thetwo Acts employ similar concepts and are enforced by similar machinery. 
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates Article 14 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, which provides for non-discrimination on thegrounds of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion,national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birthor other status. However, Article 14 protects against discrimination only inrespect of ‘the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the]Convention’: it is not, therefore, a blanket prohibition on discrimination in allcircumstances.
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
Race Relations Acts1
In 1965, parliament, for the first time, considered legal protection againstracial discrimination to be necessary. The Race Relations Act 1965, however,proved to provide only limited value in protection.
2The Act provided not for
access to the courts for protection from discrimination, but for an applicationto be made to the Race Relations Board established under the 1965 Act. TheRace Relations Act 1968 strengthened the powers of the Board, but protectionfrom discrimination remained limited. The law is now found in the RaceRelations Act 1976. 
Racial discrimination is defined under the Act as being discrimination
based on the grounds of colour, race, nationality, ethnic or national origins.Discrimination may be direct or indirect (see, further, below). The Act did not,however, prohibit all forms of racial discrimination, and confined protectionto discrimination in the field of employment, including service of the Crown,such as the armed forces,
3the police and local authorities, and to education,
housing and the provision of goods and services.

2 The Race Relations Act 1968 extended the 1965 Act, but effectiveness remained
unsatisfactory.
3 See R v Army Board of Defence Council ex parte Anderson (1992).

The problem of the scope of the 1976 Act was exacerbated by the decision
in Re Amin (1983), in which the House of Lords ruled that the functions of
many authorities could not be construed as offering a ‘service’ (such as
education, employment, housing or the provision of goods and services) andwere therefore excluded from the prohibition. The effect of Amin was to
exclude from protection such bodies as the Immigration Service, customs, theprison service and law enforcement by the police. These deficiencies have nowbeen remedied by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.
The 2000 Act
4imposes a statutory duty on public authorities5to eliminate
discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relationsbetween racial groups.
6The Act also provides for codes of practice. The duties
may be enforced by compliance notices issued by the Commission for RacialEquality, and where necessary enforced by a court order.
7The Act also makes
the police subject to the Race Relations Act 1976.8Excluded from the Act are
immigration authorities, the security services, Parliament and the ScottishParliament and Welsh Assembly, and acts of the judiciary.
The definition of racial discrimination
The courts have encountered problems with the definition of racialdiscrimination which is linked to discrimination of the grounds of colour,race, nationality, ethnic or national origins. In Seide v Gillette Industries (1980),
for example, it was held that people of Jewish origin and culture fell withinthe definition. In Mandla v Dowell Lee (1983) ,the House of Lords ruled that
Sikhs fell within the definition of a racial group and were thus protectedunder the Act.
9Gypsies have also been held to be within the definition
(Commission for Racial Equality v Dutton (1989)), although Rastafarians have
not. The tests propounded by the court in Dawkins v Department of the
Environment (1993), in relation to whether a group constitutes a racial group
for the purposes of the Act, is whether there is a long shared history and acultural tradition and customs. In Mandla v Dowell Lee (1983), the House of
Lords ruled that the characteristics of an ethnic group included a long shareddistinctive history and a distinctive cultural tradition. Further commoncharacteristics included a common geographical origin, common languageand religion, common literature, and being a minority within a larger society.

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
In Commission for Racial Equality v Dutton (1989), the Court of Appeal had
to decide whether Gypsies constituted a racial group. The court reviewed the
variety of meanings given to ‘Gypsies’. Applying the tests propounded by theHouse of Lords in Mandla v Dowell Lee, Nicholls LJ stated that:
... Gypsies are a minority, with a long shared history and a common
geographical origin ... having certain, albeit limited, customs of their own ... adistinctive style of dressing, ... a language or dialect, ... a repertoire of folktalesand music passed on from one generation to the next.
The court accepted that many Gypsies no longer derive from a ‘common
stock’, but that of itself did not prevent them from being a racial group withinthe wide definition in the Act.
10By distinction, the court ruled, in Dawkins v
Department of Environment , that Rastafarians, while enjoying distinctive
cultural features, having their own music and hair styles, do not fall withinthe meaning of a racial group, for their ‘shared history’ is only of some 60years duration (compared with that of Gypsies, whose history is of over 700years duration).
Direct and indirect discrimination
Direct discrimination
Under section 1(1) of the Act, direct discrimination involves the treatment of aperson less favourably than another, on the basis of racial grounds. For anoffence to be proven, there is no need to establish that the persondiscriminating on racial grounds intended so to do.
11Direct discrimination
includes segregation on the grounds of race, and to provide separate facilitiesfor differing races, irrespective of the quality of the facilities, is an offence.
12
Proving direct discrimination – whether on grounds of race or sex – isdifficult: there will usually be a number of other grounds for, say, rejecting anapplication for employment, other than pure racial or sexual discrimination.
13
In order to minimise the difficulties of proof, it has been established that, oncethe inference has been raised that discrimination has occurred, the burden ofproof shifts to the alleged discriminator to prove that the decision was notracially or sexually discriminatory.
14In Sidhu v Aerospace Composite Technology
Ltd (2000), the Court of Appeal ruled that an employer’s policy in relation to
violence and abusive language which applied to all employees, irrespective ofrace, was not direct discrimination when applied to an employee who hadsuffered racial abuse and retaliated with violence.
In Nagarajan v London Regional Transport (1999), the House of Lords
considered the meaning of discrimination by way of victimisation under
66110 At p 27G. See Barnett, 1995 and 1994.
11R v Council for Racial Equality ex parte Westminster City Council (1984).
12 Race Relations Act 1976, s 1(2).
13 See Cotterrell, 1981; Millar and Phillips, 1983.
14Dornan v Belfast County Council (1990).

section 2 of the Race Relations Act 1976. The issue turned on whether or not it
was necessary to establish that there was conscious motivation todiscriminate, as was held by the appeal tribunal and the Court of Appeal. TheHouse of Lords ruled that conscious motivation was not a prerequisite for afinding of direct discrimination under section 1 of the Act, and that section 2had to be read in that context. If a job applicant’s previous complaint underthe Race Relations Act had a significant influence on the decision not to offerhim a job, the case fell within section 2(1), even though the interviewee did notconsciously realise that he was prejudiced by that knowledge.
In Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire Police v Khan (2001), the House of
Lords ruled that where a chief constable had refused a reference for a policeofficer who had brought proceedings against him in an employment tribunal,the refusal was not ‘by reason that’ the officer had brought proceedings butbecause of the existence of the proceedings and the chief constable’s need topreserve his legal position in relation to them. Accordingly, the officer’scomplaint of victimisation under section 2(1)(a) of the Race Relations Act 1976failed.
Indirect discrimination
Indirect discrimination occurs when a person conducts him or herself in amanner which is not directly discriminatory, but which has the indirect effectof being discriminatory. Indirect discrimination may affect individuals or agroup of persons. Accordingly, if, for example, an employer attachesconditions of employment to an advertised post which a member of aparticular racial group cannot fulfil, there will be indirect discrimination. Theproof of indirect discrimination is again a difficult one to establish. Once aprima facie case of discrimination has been made out, it is for the defendant to
rebut the presumption that there has been discrimination. To do so, thedefendant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that any conditions ofemployment are justifiable. By way of example, in Mandla v Dowell Lee (1983),
the House of Lords ruled that the rules relating to school uniform, whichprohibited the wearing of a turban, which the pupil was required to wear onreligious grounds, were discriminatory. The House of Lords ruled that thestatutory words ‘can comply’ meant ‘can in practice comply’ or ‘canconsistently with customs and cultural conditions of the racial group comply’,not ‘can physically comply’ (pp 565–66, per Lord Fraser). Conversely, in Singh
v British Railway Engineers (1986), a condition of employment was the wearing
of protective headgear – a condition with which the applicant could notcomply by virtue of wearing a turban in accordance with the requirements ofhis faith. The court here held that the condition was justifiable on the basis ofthe requirements of safety. In Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz (1986),
however, the European Court of Justice ruled that conditions of employmentmust be justifiable, inter alia , according to the extent to which they areChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law
662

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
appropriate to achieving a necessary objective.15This test has made it more
difficult for employers to argue that conditions are non-discriminatory.
Section 33(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 provides that a person is to be
treated as a person committing an unlawful act if that person knowingly aids
another person to do an unlawful act. In Anyanwu v South Bank Students’
Union (2000), two students had been expelled from the university and
debarred from entering university premises, including the Students’ Union,by which they were employed. The Union then dismissed the students fromtheir employment. The students brought proceedings alleging that they hadbeen discriminated against on racial grounds by the Union and that theuniversity had knowingly aided the Union in their unlawful dismissal. TheCourt of Appeal held, by a majority, that, although the university had takenaction against the students, and that action brought about their dismissal fromemployment, the university had not aided or helped the Union to dismiss thestudents. In Hallan and Another v Avery and Another (2001), the House of Lords
considered the meaning of aiding another to commit an unlawful act underthe Race Relations Act 1976. Police officers told a local authority that areception booked at its premises was to be a Gypsy wedding with a potentialrisk of disturbance. Acting on that advice, the council imposed additionalbooking conditions which amounted to unlawful discrimination contrary tosections 20 and 21 of the 1976 Act. The officers, however, who took no part inthe council’s decision, could not be shown to have aided it to do that unlawfulact.
Where there is an allegation of unfair dismissal by virtue of racial
discrimination, what had to be compared was how the employer had treatedthe complainant and how that employer would have treated anotheremployee, not how a hypothetical reasonable employer would have treatedanother employee. The House of Lords so ruled in City of Glasgow Council v
Zafar (1988), holding that it was not legitimate to infer from the
unreasonableness of the dismissal that it had been racially motivated.
Exceptions to protection
Exceptions are made to the protection of the Act. Residential accommodationin small premises is excepted, as is foster accommodation for the care ofchildren.
16Businesses with less than six partners are also exempted, as are
associations with less than 25 members. Further limitations in the protectiongiven lie in the areas of employment. For example, it is justifiable for anemployer to insist on candidates for employment being of a particular race inorder to ensure authenticity. Accordingly, it is lawful for an Indian restaurantto advertise for, and employ, only Indian staff.

16 Race Relations Act 1976, s 23(2).
17Ibid, s 29.

A regrettable exception to the protection against racial discrimination
under the Race Relations Act 1976 was considered by the Court of Appeal in
Post Office v Adekeye (1996). The Court of Appeal ruled that racial
discrimination against an employee in the course of an appeal againstdismissal was not unlawful under section 4(2) of the Act, since that sectionapplied only to a person in employment. Lord Justice Peter Gibsoncommented that it was unsatisfactory that the 1976 Act did not extend to givea remedy to an ex-employee pursuing an appeal against dismissal.
An employer may be guilty of discrimination contrary to the Race
Relations Act 1976 where the employer allows a third party to abuseemployees racially in circumstances over which the employer had power tocontrol the third party. In Burton and Another v De Vere Hotels (1996), the
Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that the hotel, in allowing a guest speakerto make racially abusive remarks in the presence of its employees, actedunlawfully. An employer is under a duty to protect its employees from thedetriment of racial abuse and harassment. If an employer had sufficientcontrol over an event, and it was reasonably foreseeable that offence orharassment would occur, the employer is guilty of subjecting employees toracial abuse or harassment, contrary to section 4 of the 1976 Act.
The Commission for Racial Equality
Under the former Race Relations Acts (1965 and 1968), the Race RelationsBoard – a statutory body which had no powers of initiative to initiateinvestigations – and the Community Relations Commission were established.Under the 1976 Act, these bodies have been replaced by the Commission forRacial Equality (CRE). The chairperson and members of the Commission areappointed by the Home Secretary, and the Commission lays an annual reportbefore parliament. The Commission can assist claimants in the preparation oftheir case. The Commission also has the power to initiate investigations,provided that it has a reasonable suspicion that acts of discrimination haveoccurred.
18The Home Secretary may direct the Commission to undertake
investigations. If the Commission finds that discrimination has occurred, ithas powers to issue a ‘non-discrimination notice’. A right of appeal against anon-discrimination notice is available.
19Further, for a period of five years
from the issue of the notice, the Commission may seek an injunction from thecounty court. In relation to individual complaints of racial discrimination inemployment, complaints may be made to an employment tribunal.
20The
tribunal has the power to make an order for compensation and to make ordersChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

as to the manner in which the discrimination should be alleviated.21
Complaints relating to other areas may be made to the county court, and the
court may award damages.22
There are perceived weaknesses in the jurisdiction of the Commission. The
House of Lords has ruled that the Commission is not entitled to investigate aperson or a company unless it has a strong reason to believe thatdiscrimination has occurred. Accordingly, the Commission may notinvestigate on a mere suspicion that discrimination is occurring.
23
SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION
Sexual equality24
Factual and legal inequalities between the sexes have bedevilled history, andthe issue is one which is firmly on the agenda for reform. Feminist legaltheory, which seeks to unmask and eradicate legal discrimination based ongender, has moved from being a minority interest subject and become apopular field of study. It is often assumed that the feminist movement is afairly recent phenomenon, dating from the liberalising 1960s. Whilst thestruggle for women’s rights dates only from the eighteenth century, thedebate concerning the position of women in society has a far longer historythan that. It is possible, for example, to trace the issue back to ancient Greeceand to the writings of Plato and Aristotle. In Plato’s Republic , Socrates argues
that children, wives and property should be owned in common. Aristotle(384–322 BC) rejects such a notion in relation to both wives and property.Instead, we find that Aristotle favours private ownership of the wife – by thehusband. Nothing had changed at the time William Blackstone was writinghis Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69). For Blackstone, in marriage,
the husband and wife are ‘one person in law: that is, the very being or legalexistence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least isincorporated into that of the husband: under whose wing, protection, andcover she performs every thing’. While Blackstone insisted on human freedomand the protection of the individual by law; on the priority of the individualover the community and on the protection of private property, this free,autonomous individual was a property owning man having dominion overhis wife and children. 
The ‘feminist campaign’ began in the eighteenth century. Mary
Wollstonecraft (1759–97) argued for equality in treatment between men andwomen. In The Vindication of the Rights of Women , Wollstonecraft argued for

educational and political equality. Socio-economic changes in the eighteenth
century resulted in the emergence of middle class society, in which womenbecame a ‘leisured class’. Thus, the differences between men and womenbecame more, rather than less, defined. Excluded from public affairs and theworld of work, femininity became an objective and a goal. It was a dangerousdevelopment for women, for femininity emphasised the idea of bothdifference and fragility – and dependence. 
The legal disabilities under which women laboured, analysed by John
Stuart Mill over a century ago in The Subjection of Women (1869), have been
slow to pass. On marriage, a wife traditionally and effectively became theproperty of the husband: the doctrine was that of ‘one flesh’ created by thespiritual, legal and physical union within – in the United Kingdom – aChristian marriage. Three consequences, at least, flowed from this doctrine.First, a married woman was, until 1882, effectively incapable of owningproperty. Secondly, by marriage, a woman impliedly consented to sexualintercourse with her husband whenever he so required. It was, until theHouse of Lords’ decision in R v R in 1991 (see below, p 740), impossible in law
for a married man to rape his wife. As Archbold stated: ‘It is a clear and wellsettled law that a man cannot rape his wife.’
25Thirdly, the husband had sole
control, or custody, of the children of the marriage. Mothers, until 1839, hadno custody rights whatsoever – and then only to the age of seven years. The‘right’, such as it was, would be lost through committing adultery. Equality inparental rights was not to be achieved until 1973.
26
This power of dominion of husbands over wives – unchanged from the
fourth century BC to the late nineteenth century – arose, as John Stuart Millobserved:
... simply from the fact that from the very earliest twilight of human society,
every woman (owing to the value attached to her by men, combined with herinferiority in muscular strength) was found in a state of bondage to some man.Laws and systems of polity always begin by recognising the relations they findalready existing between individuals. They convert what was a mere physicalfact into a legal right, give it the sanction of society, and principally aim at thesubstitution of public and organised means of asserting and protecting theserights, instead of the irregular and lawless conflict of physical strength. [ The
Subjection of Women, Chapter 1]
Furthermore:
... this dependence, as it exists at present, is not an original institution, taking afresh start from considerations of justice and social expediency – it is theprimitive state of slavery lasting on, through successive mitigations andmodifications occasioned by the same causes which have softened the generalmanners, and brought all human relations more under the control of justiceand the influence of humanity. It has not lost the taint of its brutal origin.Chapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law
66625 See Archbold, 1989.
26 Guardianship Act 1973.

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
It followed from its natural origins that, in the minds of men – and probably
many women – this was the natural position and, accordingly, raised somesort of presumption that the position was right and just. In short, thepresumption needed to be rebutted by those seeking so to do – by womenthemselves, or such rare men as Mill.
General male attitudes towards the inferior status of women have been
reflected in legal judgments. By way of example, in Meacher v Meacher (1946),
Henn Collins J held that a husband was within his rights in assaulting his wifebecause she refused to obey his orders to visit her relations.
27While smacking
a woman as punishment amounted to cruelty under the old law of divorce, itwould not have been cruel if the husband had punished her ‘as one would anaughty child’.
28
Marital rape 
Until 1991, it was impossible, in law, for a husband to rape his wife,29because
the fact of marriage entailed implied consent to intercourse. This anachronismwas only removed in R v R (1991),
30when the House of Lords ruled that rape
within marriage did not constitute lawful intercourse and, accordingly, fellwithin the prohibition laid down in section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956,which provided that ‘it is a felony for a man to rape a woman’. 
The Law Commission recommended that ‘the law should continue to be
that there is no immunity for husbands in the crime of rape.
31The response
has been equivocal. Professor Glanville Williams, for example, argues, inrelation to intercourse without consent, that ‘what is wrong with this demandis not so much the act requested but its timing, or the manner of the demand’and that the ‘fearsome stigma of rape is too great a punishment for husbandswho use their strength in these circumstances’.
32Feminists have argued that
the criminalising of rape provides the mask of protection, but not its reality, aview supported by evidence from Australia, where rape within marriage hasbeen a criminal offence for over 20 years but few prosecutions are brought.
33
It is against this broad background that legal protection from overt
discrimination on the basis of sex must be evaluated.

Statutory protection from sexual discrimination
In 1919, parliament enacted legislation to remove some legal disabilities in the
field of property and contract, the vote and employment.34However, in the
field of employment, many exceptions existed to a right to equal treatment.The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 attempted to redress the factual inequalitieswhich remained. Much still remains to be achieved: the average pay forwomen has traditionally been lower than that of men; women form themajority of part time, low paid workers.
35Moreover, the demands of child
care continue to reduce the opportunities for women in employment, and thestate has not been robust in insisting that employers provide child carefacilities. The law of the European Community has had a significant impact onthe issue of equal pay for women, and domestic legal protection must be seennowadays in light of Community law.

The Equal Pay Act 1970 and Sex Discrimination Act 197537
Employment and dismissal
Contractual employment rights are regulated under the Equal Pay Act 1970,whilst other aspects of employment are governed by the Sex DiscriminationAct 1975. The two Acts are thus designed to provide protection in all fields ofemployment. It is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex or marital statusin the context of employment, education and the provision of goods andservices.
38Sexual discrimination – as with racial discrimination – may be
direct or indirect. Indirect discrimination may arise through unjustifiedconditions for employment, for example, through stipulating that applicantsbe of a certain height or age, where height or age is irrelevant to the particularjob. On the other hand, some conditions of employment will be fully justified,for example, particular academic qualifications. As with racial discrimination,once an inference of discrimination has been raised, it is for the allegedlydiscriminatory person to disprove that he or she has in fact discriminated onthe grounds of sex or marital status.
39The issue of justifiable qualifications
arose in Price v Civil Service Commission (1978), where a condition was appliedChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law
66834 Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919.
35 See, eg, R v Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission
(1994), in which English employment legislation was declared to be incompatible with
the requirements of European Community law (see, further, Chapter 9).
36 EC Treaty, Article 119; Equal Pay Directive 75/117; Equal Treatment Directive 76/207;
Pregnancy Directive 92/85; Parental Leave Directive 96/34/EC (OJ L145/4, 1996) andsee 96/34/EC (OJ L19/24, 1998); Working Time Directive 93/104/EC (OJ L307/18,1993).
37 The domestic employment legislation must be viewed in light of the substantial
development of case law under the law of the European Community, discussed inChapters 8 and 9.

39Dornan v Belfast County Council (1990).

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
that applicants be under the age of 28 years. Mrs Price, aged 35, alleged
discrimination and her claim was upheld. However, in Saunders v Richmond
upon Thames LBC (1978), a female qualified applicant was refused employment
as a golf professional, although her qualifications were higher than that of theman who was appointed. Despite her qualifications, the Employment AppealTribunal ruled that there was insufficient evidence that she had in fact beendiscriminated against on the basis of her sex. 
In order to establish sexual discrimination, a women must prove that – but
for her sex – she would have been treated more favourably. In order toestablish this requirement, the 1975 Act provides that a woman’s treatmentmust be evaluated against that of a ‘comparable man’.
40Accordingly, the
curious and regrettable consequence arises whereby, if an employer onlyemploys women – and does so at a lower rate of pay than he would have paidto men – no discrimination can be proven, for there is no comparator.
In Glasgow City Council v Marshall (2000), the House of Lords had to
determine whether employers who paid employees different rates in respectof their duties as teachers and instructors (the teachers being paid more) hadacted lawfully. Proceedings were brought under the Equal Pay Act 1970 byone male and seven female instructors, claiming that they were entitled toequal pay. The employers relied on the absence of sexual discrimination. TheHouse of Lords ruled that the employer had established a defence undersection 1(3) of the Act, and that the inequality of pay was due not to sexualdiscrimination but to some other material fact. The House of Lords alsoconsidered the section 1(3) defence in Strathclyde Regional Council v Wallace
(1998). In that case, female teachers did the same work as principal teachersbut were paid at a lower rate. The House of Lords ruled that, if a difference inpay was explained by genuine factors – in the instant case, by financialconstraints and a promotion structure established by statute – and not taintedby discrimination, that was sufficient to raise a defence. If, however, the factorwas tainted by sexual discrimination, the defence would not succeed unlesssuch discrimination could be objectively justified.
41
The position of pregnant women in employment causes particular
difficulties and, again, the idea of the comparator is utilised.42The Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 provides that dismissal onthe grounds of pregnancy is unfair.
43However, in Webb v EMO Cargo (UK)
Ltd (1992), the Court of Appeal ruled, and the House of Lords affirmed, that a
woman who was dismissed from employment because of her pregnancy wasnot unlawfully dismissed, since – comparing her to a man with a temporary

physical disability who would also have been unable to work – the man
would also have been dismissed.44The House of Lords, referred the issue to
the European Court of Justice with the following questions:
Is it discrimination on grounds of sex, contrary to the Equal Treatment
Directive, for an employer to dismiss a female employee:
(a) whom it engaged for the specific purpose of replacing another female
employee during the latter’s forthcoming maternity leave,
(b) when, very shortly after appointment, the employer discovers that the
appellant herself will be absent on maternity leave during the maternity
period of the other employee and the employer dismisses her because itneeds the jobholder to be at work during that period, and
(c) had the employer known of the pregnancy of the appellant at the date of
appointment, she would not have been appointed, and
(d) the employer would similarly have dismissed a male employee engaged
for this purpose who required leave of absence at the relevant time formedical or other reasons? 
Under European Community law, it has been held that a pregnant woman
whose application for employment was rejected on the basis of her pregnancywas a victim of discrimination. The Court of Justice ruled in favour of theappellant on two grounds. First, the Court ruled that pregnancy could not becompared with a male illness, since pregnancy was not pathological.Secondly, the appellant could not be dismissed, because her inability toperform the terms of her employment was temporary, not permanent. Thedismissal of the appellant therefore constituted sex discrimination. The Houseof Lords remitted the case to the Industrial Tribunal to consider the questionof compensation.
45While the ruling of the European Court is welcome, it does
not answer the question as to the lawfulness of dismissing a temporaryemployee on the basis of pregnancy.
The Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 provides that
a woman is protected from dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy and isentitled to 14 weeks of maternity leave. Where that employee has been incontinuous employment for two years, she is entitled to return to work within29 weeks of the birth.
46The position in relation to women with less than two
years’ continuous service remains uncertain although, in O’Neill (1996), the
court followed Webb and ruled that dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy
was unlawful. 
The right to return to work has been further protected by the Court of
Appeal in Crees v Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Ltd and Greaves v Kwik
Save Stores Ltd (1998). Both employees had taken extended maternity leave.Chapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
However, at the date on which they were due to return to work, the
employees were unwell. The employers took the view that they had failed toexercise their right to return to work and that, accordingly, their contracts ofemployment were terminated, and that, accordingly, there had been nodismissal which could be construed as unfair. The employees appealed to theEmployment Appeal Tribunal on the basis of unfair dismissal. The tribunalheld that they had not been unfairly dismissed.
47On appeal to the Court of
Appeal, the court ruled that the employees had been unfairly dismissed. Theemployees qualified for the right to return to work,
48and had given the
necessary notices. However, the court ruled that the right to return to workwas a right which had to be exercised. Nevertheless, section 42 of the 1978 Actdid not expressly require an actual presence at work on the notified day. Theprovisions did not expressly say, either, that the right to return would be‘terminated, divested or avoided’ by non-attendance. There werecircumstances where it would be impossible to return to work – for example,during a period when her place of work was closed for an annual holiday.Under section 42(1) of the 1978 Act, what was required was that the employeegave written notice of a return to work. This the employees had done. Torequire the physical presence of the employee, in order for the right to returnto work to remain, would result in absurdities. Situations such as an employeewho worked from home or who had had an accident, or where a naturaldisaster had occurred, would all result in the employee being vulnerable todismissal. Under the circumstances the only conclusion which could bereached was that the employees had, in effect, been unfairly dismissed.
49
The right to non-discrimination applies equally to men and women.50The
Court of Appeal so confirmed in Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough
Council v Jesuthasan (1998). In this case, a part time worker employed in the
public sector was held to be equally entitled as a female employee to claimredundancy payments and compensation for unfair dismissal. Jesuthasan hadoriginally alleged that he had been the victim of racial discrimination. Hesubsequently sought to amend his original application to include claims forunfair dismissal and redundancy. The Employment Appeal Tribunal refusedto allow him to amend his application.
51The Employment Protection
(Consolidation) Act 1978 had been amended by the 1995 EmploymentProtection (Part time Employees) Regulations,

House of Lords’ decision in R v Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Equal

Opportunities Commission and Another (1995) (the EOC case is discussed in
Chapter 9). The novel point for decision was whether a male part time worker
employed in the public sector was entitled to claim a redundancy paymentand compensation for unfair dismissal, in relation to a dismissal occurringbefore the 1978 Act was amended. It was common ground that, had theemployee been a female part time worker, she could have claimedredundancy payment and compensation for unfair dismissal. In the Equal
Opportunities Commission (EOC) case, the House of Lords had ruled that the
qualifying periods for entitlement
53were incompatible with European
Community law. In the present case, the employee was in exactly the sameposition as the female employee in the EOC case. It was argued for the
Council that the EOC case was distinguishable, in that the objective of
Community law was to protect women against indirect discrimination arisingout of the fact that more women than men were part time workers. MummeryLJ was unable to accept that proposition. The general proposition of law in theEOC case was that discriminatory provisions should be disapplied
irrespective of sex and, further, the employee did not complain of sexualdiscrimination but unfair dismissal and redundancy under the 1978 Act,subject to the disapplication of qualifying provisions declared in the EOC case
to be incompatible with European Community law. The employer was an‘emanation of the State’ and bound by the direct effect of Article 119 (nowArticle 141 of the EC Treaty) and relevant directives. The appeal wasallowed.
54
Sexual harassment
Sexual harassment is defined as ‘conduct of a sexual nature or other conductbased on sex affecting the dignity of men and women at work’.
55Section
6(6)(b) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and section 4 of the Race RelationsAct 1976 refer to conduct which has detrimental effect on the victim. InHereford and Worcester County Council v Clayton (1996), it was held that a sexist
comment directed against a woman firefighter was detrimental to women inthe message which it conveyed. The European Commission has drafted aCode of Practice on sexual harassment giving guidance to employees andemployers.
56Sexual harassment, as a form of sexual discrimination, is, again,
difficult both to define and to prove. 
However, the Court of Appeal took a robust approach to the issue of
harassment in Tower Boot Company v Jones (1997), holding that employers wereChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law
67253 Namely, two years of continuous employment for employees who worked for 16 or
more hours a week, and five years of continuous employment for employees who
worked between eight and 16 hours a week.

and London Underground v Edwards (1998).

under a duty to make themselves aware of any harassment in the workplace
and take steps to prevent harassment. This was the approach taken in Burton
and Another v De Vere Hotels (1996), in which the hotel management was held
liable for avoidable racial abuse on the part of hotel guests against femalestaff.
57
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides for civil remedies for
harassment. The Act provides that a person must not pursue a course ofconduct which amounts to harassment of another, and which he knows, orought to know, amounts to harassment.
58Harassment is not further defined.
The Act creates a criminal offence of harassment in addition to providing forcivil remedies in the form of a restraining order.
59The Act is not designed to
inhibit journalists or photographers, but is aimed to stop ‘stalking’. However,where an individual reporter or photographer repeatedly follows and causesharassment, that conduct may fall within the scope of the Act. 
Formerly, the courts had found difficulty in protecting individuals from
harassment where they fell outside the scope of the domestic violencelegislation.
60The former legislation, now repealed and replaced by the Family
Law Act 1996, provided for relief only where the parties were either marriedto each other, or living together as husband and wife in a cohabitingrelationship.
61In Patel v Patel (1988), for example, the courts were powerless
to grant relief in a situation where a family member (a father in law) wasbeing harassed by another family member (his son in law), because therelationship fell outside the definitions of the domestic violence legislation. InKhorasandjian v Bush (1993),
62however, the Court of Appeal controversially
extended the law of tort to provide a remedy against unwanted intrusionsinto privacy through persistent telephone calls. In that case, a formerboyfriend was unable to accept that the relationship was over. There had beenno cohabitation. While it is unclear whether there existed a separate head oftortious liability for harassment, the Court ruled that the occupier of property,in addition to the owner of the property, had the right to relief under the lawof nuisance. The Family Law Act 1996 extends the scope of eligible applicantsto include relatives and former partners, although the circumstances inKhorasandjian would still fall outside the scope of the Family Law Act 1996,in the absence of a sexual relationship and cohabitation. The Protection fromHarassment Act 1997 would, on the other hand, provide a remedy.
67357 An employment tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear a complaint of sexual harassment
made by an employee once her employment was terminated. The Court of Appeal so
held in Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc (2001). A complaint under s 6 of the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 could only be made during the relevant employment.

62 See, however, Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997).

Effectiveness
In an area of regulation which is both complex and sensitive, the law
inevitably falls short of achieving the ideal of a racially or sexually non-discriminatory society.
63Much remains to be achieved – in law and practice –
before claims to real equality can be made. 
Sexual equality under European Community law
In the field of employment, the law of the European Community has greatlyextended the equality of men and women. See Chapter 9.
EQUALITY AND DISABILITY
In 1995, parliament passed the Disability Discrimination Act, under which theNational Disability Council was established as an advisory body. The Councilhad no investigative powers in relation to allegations of discrimination nordid it have enforcement powers. The Disability Rights Commission Act 1999amends the 1995 Act and provides for the establishment of the DisabilityRights Commission, modelled on the EOC and the Commission for RacialEquality. The government has confirmed that the Act is compatible with theEuropean Convention on Human Rights, as required by section 19 of theHuman Rights Act 1998.
Under the 1995 Act, a person has a disability for the purposes of the Act if
he has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long termadverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day to day activities.
64The
provisions of the Act relate both to persons with current disability and topersons who have previously suffered a disability. It is unlawful for anemployer to discriminate against a disabled person in relation toarrangements for interviews, the terms of an offer of employment, or refusingto offer or deliberately not offering the disabled person employment. It isequally unlawful to discriminate against a disabled employee. The meaning ofdiscrimination in section 5 is modelled on the Race Relations Act 1976 and SexDiscrimination Act 1975. However, the Court of Appeal has ruled thatdiscrimination in relation to disability is different from discrimination basedon race and sex, and that cases under the legislation relating to racial andsexual discrimination are not a satisfactory guide to interpretation of the 1995Act. If less favourable treatment of a disabled person is shown to be justified,it is not discrimination.
65Where any arrangements made by the employer, or
any physical feature of the relevant premises place the disabled person at aChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

‘substantial’ disadvantage, the employer is under a duty to make adjustments
to premises, reallocate work, transfer the employee to another post, alterworking hours, assign him or her to a different place of work, allow him orher to be absent for the purposes of rehabilitation, assessment or treatment,providing training, acquiring or modifying equipment or instruction orreference manuals, modifying procedures for testing or assessment, providinga reader or interpreter and providing supervision.
66Section 7 makes detailed
provision for matters to be taken into consideration when determiningwhether an employer has complied with the duty imposed, and provides forthe making of regulations to amplify the specific requirements of the Act.Small businesses are exempt from the provisions of the Act, and Part I doesnot apply to an employer having less than 20 employees.
Complaints under the Act are made to an employment tribunal, which has
the power to make a declaration as to the rights of the complainant and therespondent in relation to the complaint, to order the respondent to paycompensation to the complainant and to make recommendations to therespondent as to the actions required to be taken to obviate or reduce theadverse effect on the complainant. Compensation is calculated by applyingthe principles applicable to the calculation of damages in claims of tort or, inScotland, reparation for breach of statutory duty, and may includecompensation for injury to feelings.
67
Part III of the Act relates to discrimination in other areas, including the
provision of goods or services, accommodation and facilities. Part V regulatespublic transport and provides that the Secretary of State may makeregulations relating to the accessibility of taxis, public service vehicles and railvehicles.
Under Part VI, the National Disability Council was established (now the
Disability Rights Commission, see below), with advisory, but notinvestigatory powers. Section 55 of the Act makes it unlawful to discriminateagainst another by way of victimisation. Victimisation is interpreted asmeaning treating a disabled person less favourably than another personwhose circumstances are the same as the disabled person, and the relevantperson is treated less favourably because the relevant person has broughtproceedings under the Act, or given evidence or information or otherwisedone anything under the Act in relation to the discriminator, or alleged thatthe other person has contravened the Act, or the person believes or suspectsthat the disabled person has done or intends to do any of those things. It isunlawful for a person to knowingly aid another person to do an act madeunlawful under the Act.

The Disability Rights Commission is a non-departmental public body. It
consists of between ten and 15 members, a majority of whom must be
disabled or be people who have had a disability. The general functions of theCommission are to work towards the elimination of discrimination againstdisabled persons; to promote the equalisation of opportunities for disabledpersons; to take such steps as it considers appropriate with a view toencouraging good practice in the treatment of disabled persons and to keepunder review the working of the 1995 and 1999 Acts.
69The Commission may
make proposals or give advice to ministers as to any aspect of the law or aproposed change to the law, and advise government agencies and otherpublic authorities as to the practical application of the law and undertake thecarrying out of research.
70
The Act also imposes a number of specific duties on the Commission.
Under section 4, the Commission may issue non-discrimination notices if it issatisfied, in the course of a formal investigation, that a person has committedan unlawful act. In lieu of enforcement notices, agreements may be enteredinto between the Commission and the relevant person, in writing and bindingon both parties, detailing the steps to be taken to ensure no unlawful act iscommitted.
71The Commission may assist persons bringing or contemplating
bringing legal proceedings under the 1995 Act.72Where such assistance is
given and the Commission incurs costs, those costs are recoverable from costsawarded to the complainant, but not from any award of damages orcompensation.
73
The Disability Rights Commission has power to issue Codes of Practice,
and when requested by the Secretary of State to do so, must prepare a Code ofPractice dealing with specified matters. Draft Codes are to be approved by theSecretary of State.
74
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Freedom of expression entails many aspects: an individual’s freedom toexpress any view he or she wishes, however offensive to others, in private orpublic; freedom of the press to express any view; freedom of authors towrite and publish; and freedom of film makers to record and distributefilms/videos for private and public consumption. Blackstone, in hisCommentaries, said of freedom of the press that:Chapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
... the liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state. Every
free man has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before thepublic; to forbid this is to destroy the freedom the press; but if he publisheswhat is improper, mischievous or illegal, he must take the consequences of hisown temerity.
In the United Kingdom, there is no right to free speech but, in a negative way,
there is a freedom of expression subject to the limitations imposed by law.Freedom of expression is regulated under Article 10 of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, now incorporated into domestic law under theHuman Rights Act 1998. However, the right is limited by restrictions.
Freedom of expression under Article 10 includes the ‘freedom to hold
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas withoutinterference by public authority and regardless of frontiers’.
75The right is
subject to such legal restrictions as are ‘necessary in a democratic society in theinterests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder orcrime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rightsand freedoms of others’.
76Legal restrictions on the exercise of the right by
members of the armed forces, police or of the administration of the state arepermitted. The effect of Article 10 is that all restrictions on the right must bejustified, in common with other restricted Articles, according to these criteria:they must be both necessary and proportionate .
77The Article 10 right is also
regulated by section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which was drafted soas to prevent claims to privacy
78restricting freedom of the press.79Section
12(4) provides that:
The court must have particular regard to the importance of the Convention
right to freedom of expression and, where the proceedings relate to materialwhich the respondent claims, or which appears to the court, to be journalistic,literary or artistic material (or to conduct connected with such material), to –
(a) the extent to which –
(i) the material is, or is about to, become available to the public;
80or
(ii) it is, or would be, in the public interest for the material to be published;
67775 But does not prevent state licensing of broadcasting, television or cinemas.
76 The issue of whether to order the postponement of reporting of a trial until after the
conclusion of a second related trial came before the Court of Appeal in R v Sherwood ex
parte The Telegraph Group plc and Others (2001). The court ruled that the ban was
necessary in the interests of justice.
77 On the meaning of these terms, see Chapter 19.78 Protected under Article 8.
79 See Chapter 19.
80 In Attorney General v Times Newspapers, the government lost its appeal to restrain
publication of Richard Tomlinson’s The Big Breach: From Top Secret to Maximum Security ,
which the government alleged would damage national security. The Court of Appeal
ruled that if the material was already in the public domain, whether at home or abroad(the book had been published in Moscow), then there should be no restraint on freedomof expression and the publishing of extracts from the book. 

(b) any relevant privacy code.81
As will be seen below, however, section 12(4) appears from the early case law
not to have deterred the courts from expanding rights to privacy when theyconflict with freedom of expression in the press. 
Restrictions on freedom of speech
Defamation82
Defamation – slander or libel – may be defined as the publication, whetheroral or written, of a falsehood which damages the reputation of the personconcerned and lowers the victim’s reputation in the eyes of ‘right thinkingmembers of society generally’.
83Slander is defamation in the form of the
spoken word; libel is defamation in some permanent form, such as publicationin books or newspapers. Publication via radio or television broadcasting, or inthe course of public theatre performances, is defined as libel rather thanslander.
84
Defamation may attract criminal or civil liability. Criminal libel85is rare,
and proceedings may not be brought without leave of a High Court judge,which will be granted only where the libel is prima facie very serious and the
public interest justifies the prosecution. In 1976, a private prosecution wasbrought against the publishers of Private Eye in respect of allegations that Sir
James Goldsmith was involved in a conspiracy to obstruct the course ofjustice.
86The Law Commission has recommended that criminal libel should
be abolished.87
Civil liability for defamation is more frequent and poses difficult questions
concerning the extent to which freedom of expression is to be balanced againstprotection of the reputation of others – whether individuals or organisations.Relaxation of the restrictions on reporting imposed by the law of defamationChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law
67881 See R v Advertising Standards Authority Ltd and Another ex parte Matthias Roth BV and
Another (2001), in which adjudications published by the Advertising Standards
Authority under its non-statutory code were held to be ‘prescribed by law’ within the
meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. The Codes of Advertising and SalesPromotion had the ‘underpinning’ of subordinate legislation which gave recognition forthe statutory recognition of means of dealing with complaints. The Code of Practice wasreadily accessible and therefore prescribed by law, its provisions being sufficiently clearand precise to enable any person to know the acceptable limits of advertisements andthe consequences of infringing the provisions.

Freedom of expression is essential in a free and democratic society, and
restrictions which inhibit criticism of public authorities, in particular,undermine the potential for scrutiny of official action. For this reason, inDerbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers (1993), the House of Lords has
ruled that neither local nor central government had standing to sue fordefamation. Lord Keith stated that ‘it is of the highest importance that ademocratically elected governmental body ... should be open to uninhibitedpublic criticism’.

If a statement is damaging to the reputation of another but neverthelessjustified on the basis that it is true, no liability will arise. It is not essential thatevery aspect of a statement must be absolutely true, but it must be true inmost material respects.
89Section 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 provides a
statutory defence of truth.90
Fair comment
Expressions of opinion on matters of public interest – even though unfair orbiased – may be protected under the defence of fair comment. The defencewill not succeed if there are factual inaccuracies in the statement or if thestatement was motivated by malice. The defence is important in givinglimited protection to the publication of comments about public figures whoseactions are matters of public interest.
91
Unintentional defamation
Under section 4 of the Defamation Act 1952, the unintentional, or innocent,publication of statements which are defamatory may be defended. It must beshown that the publisher of the defamation has genuinely tried to makeamends either by way of an apology and by correcting the false statement. 
Absolute privilege
Some speech is absolutely privileged. That is to say, the words, howeverlibellous, are protected from the law of defamation. An example of such
67988 Cmnd 5909, 1975; cf the Justice Report, The Law and the Press , 1965.
89 See, eg, Bookbinder v Tebbit (1989).
90 The protection is not absolute and is restricted, for example, in relation to publications
regarding records of former (spent) criminal convictions: Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act 1974, s 8.
91 See Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd (1958); Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd (1968).

protection is parliamentary privilege; see Chapter 18 on this. As we have seen,
Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 gives absolute protection to words spokenin proceedings in parliament. Statements made in the course of judicialproceedings also attract absolute privilege; as do statements by theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
92
Qualified privilege
This offers a more limited protection. A statement will attract qualifiedprivilege provided that the defamatory statement is made without malice. TheParliamentary Papers Act 1840 gives privilege from defamation laws to fairand accurate reports of proceedings in parliament. Qualified privilege hasbeen held to attach to a communication between a Member of Parliament –who forwarded a constituent’s complaint – and the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Society where the matter is held to be in the public interest.
93
Newspapers radio and television broadcasts also attract qualified
privilege. Under the Defamation Act 1952, protection extends to fair andaccurate reports of judicial proceedings and international organisations; fairand accurate reports of public meetings; local authority meetings; meetings ofpublic companies; proceedings before statutory tribunals and inquiries andpublic election meetings.
94
Qualified privilege was considered by the House of Lords in Reynolds v
Times Newspapers Ltd (1999). The former Prime Minister of the Republic of
Ireland brought libel proceedings against The Times newspaper in relation to
an article which, he alleged, suggested that he had lied to parliament and toCabinet colleagues. No account of the Prime Minister’s explanation was given.On qualified privilege, the House of Lords ruled, inter alia, that there should
be no defence of generic qualified privilege for political information. Thearticle had made serious allegations without giving the former PrimeMinister’s explanation, and the defence of qualified privilege was not madeout and could not be argued by the defendants at the re-trial of the issue.
In Loutchansky v Times Newspapers Ltd (2001), the Court of Appeal
reconsidered qualified privilege, following the approach laid down inReynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd (1998). In 1999, The Times had published two
articles in which it accused Grigor Loutchansky of involvement ininternational criminal activities. The public interest in a democratic societynecessitated freedom of expression and the promotion of a free and vigorouspress. However, there was a corresponding duty to act responsibly, and noprivilege arose unless the press was seen to be acting responsibly. Where thatwas made out, and there was no malice, the publisher acquired an immunityfrom legal liability for the publication of statements the truth of which couldChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

not be fully proven. Brooke LJ stated that ‘the court had to balance the
powerful interests of the media in the right to freedom of expression againstthe interest of an individual who complained that he had been wrongfullydefamed’. There was, however, no unfettered right to publish whatever anewspaper believed to be in the public interest. The publication must beconsistent with the restriction in Article 10.2 of the Convention on HumanRights. 
SEDITION, INCITEMENT TO 
DISAFFECTION AND TREASON95
Sedition
Sedition includes words or conduct directed against the peace or authority ofthe state. Sedition is a common law offence which may involve the spokenword or written materials which are libellous. The intention which must beproven in relation to sedition is that the accused intended to bring ‘into hatredor contempt’, or to ‘excite disaffection’ against, the Crown or government.
96
The words used must be such that they are intended to promote violence orpublic disorder. Merely strong criticism, therefore, which is not intended to beinflammatory will not result in liability. Recent use of the law of sedition isseen in R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex parte Choudhury (1991),
in which the Divisional Court,
97adopting the test laid down by the Canadian
Supreme Court,98ruled that the correct test for seditious intention is ‘an
intention to incite to violence or to create public disturbance or disorderagainst His Majesty or the institutions of government’. 
Incitement to disaffection
The Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934 provides that it is an offenceintentionally to attempt to dissuade a member of the armed forces fromcomplying with his duty. It is also an offence to aid, counsel or procurecommission of the principal offence. In R v Arrowsmith (1975), the defendant
was accused and convicted of distributing leaflets to soldiers urging them notto serve in Northern Ireland, and the conviction was upheld by the Court ofAppeal.
99A similar offence exists in relation to causing disaffection within the

police force.100There also remains on the statute book the Aliens Restriction
(Amendment) Act 1919, section 3 of which prohibits aliens from causing
sedition or disaffection among the population and the armed forces, andmakes it a summary offence to cause industrial unrest in an industry in whichhe has not been employed for two years. 
Treason
The Treason Act 1351 made it a capital offence to give ‘aid and comfort to theKing’s enemies’. In Joyce v Director of Public Prosecutions (1946), William Joyce
was convicted of making propaganda broadcasts on behalf of the Nazisduring the Second World War. The death penalty for treason and piracy withviolence was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, section 36.Section 21(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 abolishes the death penalty formilitary offences.
Incitement to racial hatred
The first attempt at protecting persons from racial hatred was contained in theRace Relations Act 1965. The justification for restricting offensive racist speech– and hence freedom of expression – lies in the greater need to protectindividual minority groups from demeaning and discriminatory speech.Incitement to racial hatred is now regulated under sections 17 to 23 of thePublic Order Act 1986.
101Section 17 defines racial hatred as meaning ‘hatred
against any group of persons in Great Britain defined by reference to colour,race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins’. 
There are two basic requirements which relate to the offences in the Act.
First, that the words used, or behaviour, must be ‘threatening, abusive orinsulting’. Secondly, the words or behaviour must either have been intendedto incite racial hatred or be likely to do so. Under the Act, it is an offence to usewords or behaviour, or display written material, which have the aboveelements. Publication of or distributing such material is also an offence.
102The
performance of plays, showing of films or videos or playing of records orbroadcasts intended to or likely to incite racial hatred is an offence.
103The
Act, in section 23, also creates the offence of possession of such materials.Prosecutions may only be commenced with the consent of the AttorneyGeneral.

reform prompted by the findings of the inquiry into the death of Stephen
Lawrence.106The offences of racially aggravated assault, criminal damage,

OBSCENITY, INDECENCY, 
CENSORSHIP AND PORNOGRAPHY107
The Obscene Publications Act 1959
The Obscene Publications Act 1959 creates the offence of publication of anobscene article, whether or not for gain. Further, it is an offence to have sucharticles in ownership, possession or control for the purpose of publication forgain or with a view to publication.
108An article109is ‘obscene’ if ‘its effect ... is
... such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, havingregard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter containedor embodied in it’.
110
An article will be ‘published’, according to section 1(3), if a person:
(a) distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives or lends it, or who offers it
for sale or for letting on hire; or
(b) in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or
a record, shows, plays or projects it.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amends section 1(3) by addingthe words ‘or where the matter is stored electronically, transmits that data’.
111
The tendency to ‘deprave and corrupt’
It is not sufficient that an article disgusts, or is ‘filthy’, ‘loathsome’ or‘lewd’.
112What must be established is that the article will ‘deprave or
corrupt’.113Nor is it sufficient that the article is capable of depraving or
corrupting just one person: the test is whether or not a significant proportionof persons likely to read or see the article would be depraved or corrupted byit.
114The fact that the persons likely to read the article regularly read such

materials is irrelevant to whether or not the material can deprave or
corrupt,115although the same argument may not hold if the likely audience is
to be police officers experienced with dealing with pornography.116
There exists a defence of public good117but the defence is interpreted
narrowly.118For example, in Director of Public Prosecutions v Jordan (1977),119
where the defendant argued the psychotherapeutic benefit of ‘soft porn’ forthe consumer, the judge rejected the defence, holding that what was for thepublic good was art, literature or science. It is an offence to send or attempt tosend indecent or obscene materials through the post.
120It is also an offence to
import indecent or obscene materials. Such materials may be forfeited.121
Broadcasting, cinemas, theatres and video recordings 
Section 2 of the Theatres Act 1968 prohibits obscenity in theatricalperformances. The law relating to obscenity applies to live performances,subject to the defence of public good. Legal regulation of live performancesalso exists in the form of section 20 of the Public Order Act 1986, whichprohibits the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviourintended or likely to stir up racial hatred. Section 6 of the Theatres Actprohibits words or behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace. Offenceswhich relate to gross indecency between males can also be committed undersection 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In order to avoid frivolous orcensorious legal action, the consent of the Attorney General is required inrelation to prosecutions under the Theatres Act, Public Order Act and SexualOffences Act.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 and Video Recordings Act 1984 each prohibit
obscenity on local radio services, television and video. In relation tobroadcasting, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), established underthe royal prerogative,
122is under a duty not to adopt its own political stance
on current affairs, and may only broadcast party political programmes withthe consent of the major political parties. In relation to television companiesand radio services financed through advertising, the Broadcasting Act 1990provides statutory regulation. An Independent Television Commission(ITC),
123whose members are appointed by the Home Secretary, is under aChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

duty to ensure effective competition in the provision of services. The
Commission licenses programme makers. Under section 6 of the BroadcastingAct, a number of duties are imposed on the Commission. Section 6 provides,in part, that:
(1) The Commission shall do all that they can to secure that every licensed
service compiles with the following requirements, namely:
(a) that nothing is included in its programmes which offends against good
taste or decency or is likely to encourage or incite to crime or to lead to
disorder or to be offensive to public feeling;
(b) that any news given (in whatever form) in its programmes is presented
with due accuracy and impartiality;
(c) that due impartiality is preserved on the part of the person providing
the service as respects matters of political or industrial controversy orrelating to current public policy;
(d) that due responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of any of
its programmes which are religious programmes, and that, inparticular, any such programmes do not involve:
(i) any improper exploitation of any susceptibilities of those watching
the programmes, or
(ii) any abusive treatment of the religious views and beliefs of those
belonging to a particular religion or religious denomination ...
Under section 143 of the Broadcasting Act 1990, the Broadcasting Complaints
Commission was under a duty to adjudicate upon complaints concerning:
(a) unjust or unfair treatment in programmes ...; or
(b) unwarranted infringement of privacy in, or in connection with the
obtaining of material included in, such programmes ...
The Broadcasting Act 1996 established the Broadcasting Standards
Commission, amalgamating the Broadcasting Standards Council and theBroadcasting Complaints Commission. The Broadcasting StandardsCommission is under a statutory duty to draw up codes of guidance inrelation to the portrayal of violence in programmes, and in connection withthe portrayal of sexual conduct in programmes, and ‘standards of taste anddecency for such programmes generally’.
124In addition, the Commission is
under a duty to monitor programmes and to report of such matters as theportrayal of violence, sexual conduct, and standards of taste and decency inprogrammes and to consider complaints.
125The Commission also has the
power to make reports on standards and, in particular, may make anassessment of the attitudes of the public at large in relation to violence orsexual conduct in programmes, and standards of taste and decency. 
The Broadcasting Act 1990 also conferred power on the Secretary of State
to proscribe foreign satellite services, where the Independent Television
685124 Broadcasting Act 1996, ss 107, 108.
125Ibid, ss 109, 110.

Commission, or Radio Authority, consider that a satellite service is
‘unacceptable’ on the basis that it repeatedly contains material which ‘offendsagainst good taste or decency or is likely to incite to crime or to lead todisorder or to be offensive to public feeling’.
126
Section 109 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 extends the functions of the
Broadcasting Standards Commission to include monitoring:
... so far as practicable, all television and sound programmes which are
transmitted or sent from outside the United Kingdom but are capable of beingreceived there, with a view to ascertaining:
(a) how violence and sexual conduct are portrayed in those programmes; and
(b) the extent to which those programmes meet standards of taste and
decency.
The regulation of films falls to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC),
and their availability for viewing by the public controlled by local authorities.The BBFC operates a system of classification by age: ‘U’ for generalcirculation, ‘PG’ (parental guidance), 12, 15, and 18 certificate films, and R18films which are for restricted viewing only on segregated premises. The BBFCmay refuse a certificate if the film contravenes the Obscene Publications Act1959, and may insist on cuts to a film before a certificate is granted. Localauthorities exercise control through the granting of licences for a particularfilm to be shown in its area.
127
The BBFC also classifies videos for private viewing. The Video Recordings
Act 1984 requires that the BBFC should have ‘special regard to the likelihood ofvideo works being viewed in the home’ (section 4). The BBFC must also pay‘special regard’ to the harm caused potential viewers by the depiction ofcriminal activity, illegal drugs, violence and sexual behaviour.
128The growth
in Internet availability led to the transmission of electronically stored databeing included within the Obscene Publications Act 1959 definition of‘publication’.
129However, the likelihood of enforcement is slim, given the
nature of the Internet and the ability of anyone, worldwide, to place items on it.
Conspiracy to corrupt public morals
Under the common law, publishers may be liable for the offence of conspiracyto corrupt public morals. In Shaw v Director of Public Prosecutions (1962), Shaw,
the publisher of a directory giving the names and details of prostitutes wasprosecuted for conspiracy to corrupt public morals.
130The House of Lords
(Lord Reid dissenting) held that the courts have a ‘residual power to enforceChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
the supreme and fundamental purpose of the law, to conserve not only the
safety and order but also the moral welfare of the state’.131
Shaw v Director of Public Prosecutions was upheld in Knuller Ltd v Director of
Public Prosecutions (1973). The publishers had produced a magazine
containing advertisements for male homosexuals. The House of Lords upheldShaw, rejecting as a defence the fact that the Sexual Offences Act 1967
provided that homosexual acts between adult males, in private, were nolonger an offence. The use of this common law offence is rare; nevertheless, itremains an available offence which enables the state to avoid statutoryoffences which provide defences such as that of the ‘public good’.
132
Blasphemy and blasphemous libel133
Blasphemy is a common law offence which prohibits words which causeoutrage to the feelings of a Christian by abusing Christ or by denying orattacking the established church. Between 1922 and 1977, there were noprosecutions brought and it was thought that the offence had fallen intodisuse. In 1976, however, the magazine Gay News published a poem and
illustration depicting Christ at the Crucifixion. A private prosecution againstthe editor and publisher was instigated,
134alleging that the poem and
illustration ‘vilified Christ in His Life and His Crucifixion’. The resulting casewas R v Lemon (1979), in which the jury, by a majority verdict, found the
words and drawing blasphemous.
135On appeal to the House of Lords, the
question of law concerned the mental element required for a conviction ofblasphemy. By a majority, the House of Lords held that there was no need toprove an intention to blaspheme, but rather that it was sufficient to prove thata blasphemous libel – a publication calculated to outrage and insult aChristian’s religious beliefs – had been published. The majority
136dismissed
the appeal against conviction, holding that the law required no more than anintention to publish words found by the jury to be blasphemous. It wasunnecessary to hold
137that there was intention to offend, or reckless
indifference to whether or not offence was caused. 
In Lord Scarman’s opinion, the law should be extended to protect the
religious beliefs and feelings of non-Christians. Lord Scarman stated that:
... the offence belongs to a group of criminal offences designed to safeguard the
internal tranquillity of the kingdom. In an increasingly plural society such asthat of modern Britain it is necessary not only to respect the differing religious

beliefs, feelings and practices of all but also to protect them from scurrility,
vilification, ridicule and contempt. [p 658]
This view was not to prevail, however. In R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary
Magistrate ex parte Choudhury (1991), it was held that blasphemy remained
confined to protection of the Christian religion as exemplified by the
established Church of England, and did not extend to the protection of theIslamic faith. That the law should offer such limited and discriminatoryprotection is both anachronistic and offensive to the principle of equality in apluralistic society. The Law Commission in 1985 recommended that theoffence be abolished,
138 but the government has not acted on this
recommendation.139
Contempt of court
The law relating to contempt of court developed in order to protect thejudiciary and judicial proceedings from actions or words which wouldimpede or adversely affect the administration of justice, or ‘tends to obstruct,prejudice or abuse the administration of justice’.
140Contempt of court, under
English but not Scottish law, may be criminal or civil. In relation to criminalcontempt, which may be dealt with in both the civil and criminal courts, theaction relates to conduct which is designed to interfere with theadministration of justice, which may of itself involve a criminal offence. Thecourt has the power to rule on the existence of a contempt and to punish theguilty party. Where the judge finds the person guilty of contempt, he maycommit the person instantly to prison. Two principal forms of criminalcontempt exist.
Scandalising the court
The need to maintain public confidence in the judiciary underpins thisoffence. Criticism of a judge, or a court’s decision, may be a contempt if itsuggests bias or unfairness on the part of the judge or court.
141
Contempt in the face of the court

refusal of a witness to answer questions or give evidence, or comply with a
court order to disclose information may amount to contempt.143
Publications prejudicing the course of justice
The balance to be struck between freedom of expression and the protection ofjudicial proceedings is a matter for debate. The Contempt of Court Act 1981,which reformed the common law of contempt, sought to achieve theappropriate balance. Before that Act, the law relating to contempt provedcapable of inhibiting freedom of the press for an extensive period of time,where judicial proceedings became protracted. The leading case whichpresaged reform of the law is that of The Sunday Times v United Kingdom (1979)
(see, further, Chapter 19). In 1974, the House of Lords restored aninjunction
144prohibiting The Sunday Times from publishing articles relating to
the drug Thalidomide, manufactured by Distillers Ltd, which, it was alleged,caused serious deformities in babies. The parents of the affected childrenintended to sue Distillers for compensation. The company entered intoprotracted negotiations with the families’ solicitors. The injunction restrainedany further publication on the matter by the newspaper. The Sunday Times
made an application under the Article 10 of the European Convention onHuman Rights, which protects freedom of expression, alleging that thecommon law of contempt violated Article 10. The European Court of HumanRights held that there had been a violation of Article 10. 
The Contempt of Court Act 1981
Section 1 of the Contempt of Court Act provides for the ‘strict liability rule’.The rule is defined as ‘the rule of law whereby conduct may be treated as acontempt of court as tending to interfere with the course of justice inparticular legal proceedings regardless of intent to do so ’ (emphasis added). In
order for the strict liability rule to be established, a number of issues need tobe satisfied. First, the test relates only to publications falling within section 2 ofthe Act. Publications are defined in section 2(1) as including ‘any speech,writing [programme included in a programme service]
145or other
communication in whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large orany section of the public’. Secondly, the publication must be such that it‘creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings inquestion will be seriously impeded or prejudiced’. Thirdly, the strict liabilityrule applies only if the proceedings in question are ‘active’, as defined bySchedule 2 to the Act. In relation to appellate proceedings, these are active
689143 See Attorney General v Mulholland and Foster (1970); British Steel Corporation v Granada
Television Ltd (1963).
144Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd (1974). The injunction had been discharged by
the Court of Appeal.
145 Added by the Broadcasting Act 1990, s 203.

from the time when they are commenced, by an application for leave to
appeal or apply for review, or by notice of appeal or of application to reviewor by other originating process, ‘until disposed of or abandoned, discontinuedor withdrawn’.
146In relation to criminal proceedings, the starting point is the
issue of a warrant for arrest, arrest without warrant or the service of anindictment.
147The end point is acquittal, sentence, any other verdict or
discontinuance of the trial. In relation to civil proceedings, the start point iswhen the case is set down for a hearing in the High Court. The end point iswhen the proceedings are disposed of, discontinued or withdrawn.
148
It is a defence to prove that, at the time of publication, or distribution of
the publication, he or she does not know, and has no reason to suspect, thatrelevant proceedings are active.
149Fair and accurate reports of legal
proceedings, held in public, and published ‘contemporaneously and in goodfaith’ do not attract the strict liability rule.
150In addition, if publication is
made as, or as part of, a discussion in ‘good faith of public affairs or othermatters of general public interest’, it is not to be treated as contempt of court,‘if the risk of impediment or prejudice to particular legal proceedings ismerely incidental to the discussion’.
151
Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act regulates the disclosure of
sources. The court may not require disclosure, and a person will not be guiltyof contempt as a result of non-disclosure, unless the court is satisfied that‘disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for theprevention of disorder or crime’. The leading case is X Ltd v Morgan Grampian
(1991), in which the House of Lords ruled on the decision making processentailed in section 10. In that case, a confidential plan was stolen from theplaintiffs and information from the plan given to a journalist. The plaintiffsapplied for an order requiring the journalist, William Goodwin, to disclose thesource and sought discovery of his notes of the telephone conversation inorder to discover the identity of the source. The House of Lords, in balancingthe competing interests – the applicant’s right to take legal action against thesource and the journalist’s interest in maintaining confidentiality with thesource – held that the interests of the plaintiffs outweighed the interests of thejournalist. This decision led to an application under the European Conventionunder Article 10 – the right to freedom of expression. In Goodwin v United
Kingdom (1996), the Court ruled that the order against the journalist violated
his right to freedom of expression which was central to a free press.

It is for the court to determine whether a particular decision making forum
is a ‘court’ for the purposes of the law as to contempt of court. In General
Medical Council v British Broadcasting Corporation (1998), the Court of Appeal
ruled that the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) of the General Medical
Council was not part of the judicial process of the state and accordingly wasnot subject to the Contempt of Court Act 1981. The PCC was a statutorycommittee under the Medical Act 1983, with power to remove the registrationof a medical practitioner if found guilty of a criminal offence or judged to beguilty of serious professional misconduct. The PCC sat in public and had theassistance of a legally qualified assessor to advise on questions of law. Allparties were entitled to be heard and represented by solicitors and counsel.Evidence was given on oath and witnesses could be summonsed anddocuments called for. The PCC was therefore exercising a sort of judicialpower, but it was not the judicial power of the state. It has a recognisablejudicial function, but was not part of the judicial system of the state.Accordingly, the PCC did not constitute a court for contempt of courtpurposes.
Where the judge considers that disclosure is necessary in the interests of
justice, a discretion remains as to whether disclosure should be ordered. Thatinvolved weighing up the competing interests of the need for disclosure andthe need for protection of sources. In John and Others v Express Newspapers and
Others (2000), the Court of Appeal ruled that the need to protect journalistic
sources overrode the need for disclosure of the source of a confidentialdocument which had come into the hands of a journalist by a breach ofconfidentiality in relation to legal advice given by a firm of solicitors.
153
However, the exercise of discretion led to a different conclusion in Camelot
Group plc v Centaur (1999). In that case, a disloyal employee of Camelot sent a
copy of draft accounts to a journalist employed by the defendant. The Court ofAppeal ruled that the public interest in enabling the plaintiffs to discover adisloyal employee who leaked confidential information was greater than thepublic interest in enabling the employee to escape detection. The order fordisclosure was upheld. 
Contempt of court and Article 10 of the European Convention
The impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 is being felt in this area of law. InAshworth Security Hospital v MGN Ltd ,The Mirror newspaper had published
verbatim extracts from hospital medical records of information concerning aconvicted murderer who was detained at the hospital. The information hadbeen supplied to the newspaper, in breach of confidence and breach ofcontract, by a hospital employee through an intermediary. The Contempt of
691153 See, most recently, the Court of Appeal’s refusal to order disclosure to the police of
supposed evidence relating to former MI5 officer, David Shayler, held by The Guardian
and The Observer newspapers: (2000) The Guardian , 21 July.

Court Act 1981, section 10, provided for orders of disclosure of sources of
information only where it was established that ‘disclosure is necessary in theinterests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder orcrime’. The hospital had failed to identify the informant and sought an orderthat MGN identify the intermediary as the only likely means of discoveringthe source’s identity. MGN argued that such an order would contraveneArticle 10 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal ruled that unless the sourcewas identified and dismissed, there was a significant risk that there would befurther selling of confidential information, and that such disclosuresamounted to an attack on confidentiality which should be safeguarded in anydemocratic society. Where a person against whom disclosure was sought – inthis case the intermediary – had ‘become mixed-up in wrongful, albeit nottortious, conduct that infringed a claimant’s legal rights’, the court hadjurisdiction to order disclosure. In Interbrew SA v Financial Times (2001), the
court declared itself bound by the decision in Ashworth .
154A claimant was
entitled to an order for delivery up of leaked and partly forged documentsheld by publishers in order to enable him to ascertain the proper defendant toa breach of confidence action. The ‘public interest in protecting the source of aleak was not sufficient to withstand the countervailing public interest inletting Interbrew seek justice in the courts against the source’.
155
In Attorney General v Punch Ltd and Another (2001), the Court of Appeal
considered Article 10. The former editor of Punch, and the publishers, had
been fined for being in contempt of court. At issue was the publication byPunch of an article by David Shayler, the former MI5 officer. The Attorney
General had been granted injunctions on the basis that revelations by DavidShayler about matters relating to his employment would be contrary tonational security. The question was, where a court ordered that specifiedmaterial was not to be published, would a third party who, with theknowledge of the order, published the specified material automaticallycommit a contempt of court, or would contempt only occur if the third partythereby knowingly defeated the purpose for which the order was made? Thecourt considered Attorney General v Newspaper Publishing plc (1988) , Attorney
General v Observer Ltd (No 2) (1990) and Attorney General v Times Newspapers
Ltd (1992). It ruled that intentional interference with the manner in which a
judge was conducting a trial could amount to a contempt of court, and that athird party who, with knowledge of that purpose, intentionally acted in such away as to defeat that purpose could be in contempt of court. Although theorder did not bind the third party, contempt arose where the conduct of thetrial was disrupted. Allowing the appeal, the court stated that the injunctionresulted in the ‘imposition of a restriction on freedom of the press that wasChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

155 The restriction on publication of information which would lead to the identification of

the Court of Appeal in H v N (A Health Authority); H v Associated Newspapers Ltd (2002).

disproportionate to any public interest and thus in breach of Article 10 of the
Convention’. 
Law of confidence
Injunctions may be sought in order to restrain the publication of information.Injunctions are orders of a court, which can be either permanent or interim.Injunctions impose what is called a ‘prior restraint’, that is to say, they preventdisclosure of information in advance to avoid publication. An injunction canbe granted on the basis that the proposed item is libellous (defamatory) or inbreach of the common law duty of confidence. In the case of alleged libel,judges are reluctant to impose a ‘prior restraint’ by way of injunction and willnot grant it if the defendant swears that they can prove the truth of thedefamatory statement or can defend it on the basis of ‘fair comment’. In casesof breach of confidence, the judges are more willing to grant the injunction.An example of this is seen in Schering Chemical v Falkman Ltd (1981). In
Schering, a Thames Television documentary regarding a pregnancy drug was
scheduled for transmission. The programme’s producer had been engaged asa consultant to the drug manufacturers and the programme revealed materialobtained by him during his consultancy. The court held that a duty ofconfidence existed, which should be enforced by injunction. In 1987, theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) intended to transmit a televisiondocumentary My Country Right or Wrong in which former security officers
were interviewed. An injunction was granted on the basis that there hadoccurred a breach of confidence in the course of interviews.
156The BBC was
vetted by the Attorney General, who then withdrew the action but,nevertheless, the transmission of the programme had been delayed for sixmonths. 
In the Thalidomide case (which resulted in The Sunday Times v United
Kingdom ) (1980), injunctions were used to restrain newspapers from
publishing material which might have been prejudicial to forthcoming judicialproceedings. For discussion of the case, see, further, Chapter 22. The bookSpycatcher, written by a former member of the Security Services, was also
restrained by way of an injunction based on breach of confidence owed to theService. See Chapter 23 for a discussion of Spycatcher. One objectionable aspect
of the use of such prior restraint is that there exists no trial of the merits of thework which is being restrained: an injunction is issued, and the trial of thefacts may occur much later, when it may transpire that there has been anunjustified, and often lengthy, restriction on freedom of expression. 
The notion of breach of confidence, originally relevant mainly to trade
secrets and unfair competition and industrial espionage, has expanded overtwo decades in no particularly logical way, proceeding on a case by case basis.
693156 (1987) The Times , 5 and 18 December.

Disclosure of information may amount to breach of confidence if the
relationship is based on marriage,157contracts of employment, consultancies
and potentially any situation involving a ‘confidential relationship’. A duty ofconfidence is owed to Cabinet by individual ministers,
158and by members of
the Security Services and civil servants to the Crown.159Where such a
relationship is held to exist, an obligation is imposed to keep informationconfidential and a proposed disclosure will found an action for breach ofconfidence. Defences to an action for breach of confidence include thefollowing:
Staleness
In Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976) (the Crossman Diaries case) the
information disclosed in breach of confidence was some ten years old and noharm would follow from its publication. Accordingly, the court held that, inthe absence of a breach of national security, further restraint was not justified.However, in the Spycatcher case, Attorney General v Guardian (No 2) (1990),
while the injunction was eventually lifted, the government claimed that theduty of former Security Service personnel is lifelong and that no publication ofany matter concerning their employment may be disclosed. Section 1 of theOfficial Secrets Act 1989 now reflects this duty and imposes criminal sanctionson any revelations made in relation to security matters.
The material is in the public domain
While there may be found to be a duty of confidence, this duty does notnecessarily result in an injunction being permanently imposed to restrainpublication. In addition to the material being ‘stale’, it may be that thematerial has already been published elsewhere, and is thus in the ‘publicdomain’. In relation to the book Spycatcher , this matter weighed with the court.
The book had been published in Australia and the United States of Americaand was, in fact, freely available anywhere outside the United Kingdom. 
Revealing true information to correct falsity
Irrespective of the existence of a duty of confidence, there may be situationswhere material has been published which is false and which justifies a breachof confidence in order to rectify the falsehood. In Woodward v Hutchins (1977),
for example, a falsehood concerning a pop star had been published.Notwithstanding a duty of confidence, there was a justified and legitimateneed for rebuttal of the untruths. Chapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
Iniquity: to reveal evidence crime/fraud
Breach of confidence may be excused by the court if the defence of revealing
criminal or fraudulent activities is made out.
Public interest
The defence of public interest was considered in Lion Laboratories v Evans and
Express Newspapers (1984). The Express newspaper revealed information
concerning faulty intoximeters used to measure the extent of alcohol in anindividual’s bloodstream. Deficiencies in the breathalyser equipment couldhave resulted in wrongful convictions for driving under the influence ofalcohol. The disclosure of confidential information was justified. There was noquestion of the manufacturer having been guilty of any ‘iniquity’ orwrongdoing. However, the matter was one of public interest which overrodeany claim to confidentiality of the information. 
PRIVACY AND THE MEDIA
The invasion of privacy by the media has also become a matter of risingconcern. In 1953, the Press Council was established.
160This self-regulatory
body proved woefully inadequate at controlling the press, not least because ithad no powers to fine newspapers. In 1972, the Younger Committee wasestablished to consider reforms in relation to press freedom. The Committeerecommended that a tort of disclosure of information unlawfully acquiredand a tort and crime of unlawful surveillance by technical devices beintroduced.
161The proposed reforms were not implemented. Concern over
intrusions into individual privacy have increased with the media attentiongiven to the Royal Family in recent years. The case of Kaye v Robertson and
Another (1991) heightened public interest in the respective right of an
individual to privacy and the right of the public to information. In Kaye,
journalists entered a hospital room in which the well known actor, GordonKaye, was being treated for severe injuries sustained in a car accident. Kayeagreed neither to be photographed nor interviewed. An injunction wassought, and granted, to restrain the newspaper from publishing the‘interview’ and photographs. On appeal, the Court of Appeal ruled that therewas no right to privacy under English law which could found the basis for aninjunction. 
In 1990, the Committee on Privacy and Related Matters (the Calcutt
committee) was established, which led to the creation of another self-

broadcasting: Broadcasting Act 1990, s 142.

regulatory body in 1991, the Press Complaints Commission.162A review of
the working of the Commission by Sir David Calcutt163found the protection
accorded to individuals inadequate. It has been recommended, therefore, that
a statutory body be established. That recommendation has not beenfavoured.
164
Privacy, freedom of expression and the Human Rights Act 1998
While there is no common right to privacy, the law relating to breach ofconfidence has been expanded to a degree which suggests that privacy claimsare being given greater protection than was the case prior to the HumanRights Act 1998. In Douglas and Others v Hello! Ltd (2001), the Court of Appeal
ruled that individuals had a right of personal privacy which was grounded inthe equitable doctrine of breach of confidence.
165Michael Douglas and
Catherine Zeta Jones had granted OK! magazine exclusive rights to publish
photographs of their wedding. Hello! magazine had obtained photographs of
the wedding and had been subjected to an interim injunction restrainingpublication before the trial of the substantive issues.
166In this case, the
claimants had lessened the degree of privacy concerning their wedding byallowing OK! magazine to publish photographs, thereby affecting the balance
between their rights (to privacy) and the rights of others to freedom ofexpression. The court discharged the injunction. However, in a strongstatement of principle, Sedley LJ said that ‘we have reached a point at which itcan be said with confidence that the law recognises and will appropriatelyprotect a right of personal privacy’.
In Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) Ltd (2002), the model Naomi
Campbell was awarded damages,, albeit minimal, by the High Court for thedisclosure of information relating to her attending meetings for the treatmentof drug addiction. The claimant accepted that The Mirror was entitled to
publish the fact that she was addicted to drugs and that she was havingtherapy, but argued that details of the treatment were private and confidentialmatters and that there was no overriding public interest justifying theirpublication. The court ruled that in order for a claim for breach of confidenceto succeed, the claimant had to establish three things:
• that the details given had the necessary quality of confidence about them;
• that the details given must have been imparted in circumstances
importing an obligation of confidence; and thatChapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Freedom from Discrimination: Racial and Sexual Equality
• publication of the details must have been to the claimant’s detriment.
The Court recognised that celebrities – even ‘self-publicists – were entitled to
some space or privacy’. Unless there was an overriding public interest inpublication, the media had to respect information relating to the private livesof celebrities which they legitimately chose to keep private. 
Campbell may be compared with A v B plc (2001). The Court of Appeal
ruled that any interference with freedom of the press had to be justified, andcould not be limited because there was no identifiable public interest in thematerial being published. The court distinguished between the confidentialitywhich attached to sexual relations within marriage ‘or other stablerelationships’ and the confidentiality which attached to transientrelationships. Here, a footballer, A, had had sexual relationships with C andD. He did not want his wife to find out. C and D, however, had no interest inmaintaining confidentiality. The Lord Chief Justice recognised that theConvention provided ‘new parameters within which the court would decidein an action for breach of confidence whether a person was entitled to have hisprivacy protected’, or ‘whether the intrusion into freedom of informationwhich such protection involved could not be justified’. In this case, it was notobvious why an injunction should be granted: A’s relationships were not inthe categories of relationships which the court should be astute to protectwhen other parties did not want them to remain confidential. Freedom of thepress should prevail, and regulation of reporting in the press should be amatter for the Press Council, not the courts.
In exceptional circumstances, where individuals were at serious risk of
injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became known, the law ofconfidence could be applied to protect them. The Family Division of the HighCourt so held in Venables and Another v News Group Newspapers and Others
(2001). In exceptional circumstances, taking into account the Human RightsAct 1998 and in particular the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention,the court had jurisdiction to extent the protection of confidentiality where ‘notto do so would be likely to lead to serious physical injury, or the death of theperson seeking that confidentiality’, and there was no other way to protect theapplicants other than seeking injunctive relief.
The issue of whether to order the postponement of reporting of a trial until
after the conclusion of a second related trial was considered in R v Sherwood ex
parte The Telegraph Group plc and Others (2001). The Court of Appeal dismissed
an appeal against an order made under section 4(2) of the Contempt of CourtAct 1981 during the trial of a police constable for murder. The order preventedreporting on that trial until after the conclusion of a second trial against threeother defendants who were originally co-defendants of the accused. Thejurisdiction to make a postponement order under the 1981 operated in light ofArticles 6 (right to fair trial) and 10 (right to freedom of expression) of theConvention. The 1981 Act required the court to consider whether a ban wasnecessary to avoid the perceived risk of prejudice. Even if such a risk was not
697

demonstrated, however, it did not follow that an order had to be made. The
next question to address was whether such an order was ‘necessary’ withinthe meaning of Article 10(2) of the Convention. A three stage test wasnecessary. First, it should be asked whether reporting would give rise to a notinsubstantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice. Secondly, ifthere was such a risk, would a postponement order eliminate the risk?Thirdly, even if it was considered that there was no other way of eliminatingthe risk, the judge had to consider whether the degree of risk contemplatedshould be regarded as ‘tolerable in the sense of being the lesser of two evils’.At this stage it was necessary to make value judgments as to the prioritybetween competing public interests. Justice required that the two trials beseparated, and publicity would inevitably defeat the purpose of the severanceorder.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in Lord Chancellor and Another v
Coker and Another (2001) that the Lord Chancellor did not discriminate against
two women, one of whom was black, on the grounds of sex or race when heappointed as special adviser a white male who was well known to him,without advertising the post. The appointment process with regard to specialadvisers was not subject to the general rules that applied to the appointmentof civil servants, since special advisers were not civil servants. In appointing aspecial adviser, a key quality of the applicant was a commitment to thepolitical understanding of the particular minister.Chapter 20: Constitutional and Administrative Law

699CHAPTER 21
PART I – ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY 
While the detection and prosecution of crime and the preservation of public
order are of first importance in any state, the extent to which police powersreflect a legitimate interference with the liberty and security of citizens is aproblematic question which involves evaluating the balance struck betweenthe rights of the individual and the powers of the police.
In any society, it is essential that there be a balance effected between the
legitimate rights of individual citizens to conduct their lives in maximumfreedom and the equally important need to protect order in society, withoutwhich no citizen would enjoy freedom. In this chapter, the organisation of thepolice forces is considered. Further, the manner in which law regulatesassociations and assemblies – whether meetings or processions – is examined.In addition, it is necessary to consider the manner in which law regulates anindividual’s freedom to move around, and the conditions under which it is oris not lawful to enter into and remain on land, both private and public. Thepowers of the police in relation to these issues and public order offences arealso considered, as are the powers of the police in relation to arrest anddetention in the course of the investigation of crime.
The law of association and assembly must now be evaluated against
Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated underthe Human Rights Act 1998. Article 11 provides that ‘everyone has the right tofreedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others,including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of hisinterests’.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
While citizens are generally free to join any club, society or trades union, twostatutory restrictions exist. The first restriction relates to membership ofmilitary or quasi-military organisations. The Public Order Act 1936 provides,in part, that the wearing of uniforms in public with the intention of promotinga political objective is unlawful, and that membership of groups organisedand trained for the purpose of displaying physical force is unlawful. To be aFREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY,

member of such a group, or to solicit or invite financial or other support for
the group, is an offence. 
In R v Jordan and Tyndall (1963), the defendants were members of a fascist
group, Spearhead. They exercised in military fashion and were known to be
storing chemicals capable of being used for the manufacture of bombs. Theywere convicted under section 2(1)(b) of the Public Order Act 1936. In Director
of Public Prosecutions v Whelan (1975),the defendants were charged under
section 1 of the 1936 Act. Participating in a Sinn Fein march in Northern
Ireland, the defendants wore black berets, dark clothing and carried the Irishflag. It was held that the wearing of similar clothing could amount to a‘uniform’. Specific groups are proscribed, and Schedule 2 to the 2000 Act listssuch groups. 
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
... it can hardly be said that our constitution knows of such a thing as any
specific right of public meeting.2
Freedom of assembly is closely related to freedom of speech. An individual isfree to assemble with others to the extent that the law does not prohibit suchassemblies or the assembly does not involve unlawful actions. In 1898, Diceywas to record that ‘the police have with us no special authority to control openair assemblies’. Today much has changed. Under common law, a number ofrestraints were placed on this freedom, and the Public Order Acts 1936 and1986 and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 restrict rights ofassembly. While there is a general freedom to assemble on private property oron public land, in the case of the former, it will be a trespass to do so withoutthe consent of the landowner. In relation to land to which the public have theright of access, the right of assembly is controlled by local authority bylaws,and a criminal offence is committed if these are breached. Further, the right ofassembly may be controlled by statute. By way of example, the right toassemble in Trafalgar Square is regulated under statute, under whichpermission must be granted by the Secretary of State for the Environment.

Hyde Park is equally regulated.4
The duty to facilitate meetings
The constitutional importance of freedom of expression and involvement in
civic life is reflected in the right to use schools and other public rooms forChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

meetings in local elections, by-elections and general elections.5In addition,
under the Education (No 2) Act 1986, the governing bodies of universities and
colleges are under a duty to ‘take such steps as are reasonably practicable toensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members,students and employees of the establishment and for visiting speakers’.
6This
requirement gave rise to a challenge in R v University of Liverpool ex parte
Caesar-Gordon (1991). In that case, the university had refused permission for a
meeting at which two diplomats from the South African Embassy were due tospeak. The decision was based on the fear that the meeting would causepublic unrest in the surrounding area. The Divisional Court ruled that theuniversity had acted ultra vires its powers. The university authorities were not
entitled to take into account threats of violence outside its precincts. Onlywhere the risk of violence would relate to university precincts, would theuniversity be justified in imposing restrictions.
The meaning of ‘public meeting’ was considered by the House of Lords in
McCartan (Turkington Breen) v Times Newspapers Ltd (2000). At issue was
whether a meeting, in this case a press conference, held on private premises,to which members of the press had been invited and others also attended,without an invitation but without any restriction, was a ‘public meeting’.
7A
meeting was public if those who arranged it opened it to the public, or byissuing a general invitation to the press showed an intention that theproceedings of the meeting should be communicated to a wider public.
The right of assembly is intricately linked to the right to freedom of
expression protected under Article 10 of the European Convention.
8In R v
Secretary of State for Health ex parte Wagstaff; R v Secretary of State for Health exparte Associated Newspapers Ltd (2001), the High Court ruled that the holding in
private of the inquiry into the multiple murders committed by Dr HaroldShipman contravened Article 10. It constituted unjustified governmentalinterference with the reception of information that others wish or may bewilling to impart. Compare R (Persey) v Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (2002), in which the High Court distinguished Wagstaff and
ruled that Article 10 did not impose a positive obligation on government toprovide an ‘open forum’. The applications related to the Secretary of State’sdecision to hold three separate, independent inquiries into the outbreak offoot and mouth disease with the evidence for the most part to be held inprivate. The court distinguished between the right to freedom of expressionand access to information: Article 10 prohibited interference with freedom ofexpression, it did not require its facilitation. Equally, the High Court ruled in

Act 1985 and Greater London Authority Act 1999, s 17.

R (Hard) v Secretary of State for Health (2002) that there was no presumption one
way or the other as to whether an inquiry should be held in public. There was
no right to access to information conferred by Article 10.
INDIRECT RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY
A number of indirect means may be employed in order to restrain publicmeetings. Such means include breach of the peace, obstruction of policeofficers and obstruction of the highway.
Breach of the peace
In Beatty v Gillbanks (1882), the Salvation Army met knowing that there would
be an opposing meeting. The magistrates’ court issued an order preventingthe meeting. When the meeting assembled in defiance of the order, the policeordered the meeting to disband and arrested one of the members. On thedefendant’s appeal against conviction, the Queen’s Bench Division refused toaccept the restriction on freedom of assembly based on the threatenedunlawful acts of others. Where, however, participants in a meeting engage inunlawful conduct which provokes others and results in a breach of the peace –or a reasonable apprehension of a breach of the peace – the meeting may beheld to be unlawful. Further, if the meeting is conducted lawfully and yetprovokes an actual breach of the peace, the police may order the meeting todisband. Failure to comply with an order to leave an assembly on the groundsof an officer’s reasonable belief that it is necessary to avoid a breach of thepeace is a criminal offence.
9
The Beatty v Gillbanks principle – namely, that a person acting lawfully was
not responsible for the unlawful reaction of others – has been undermined in anumber of cases. In Jordan v Burgoyne (1963), the court ruled that a person
addressing an audience would be found guilty of a breach of the peace if hisor her words were likely to inflame the audience and lead to violence.Equally, in Percy v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995), the court ruled that
conduct which was not itself unlawful could amount to a breach of the peaceif the words spoken were likely to cause disorder among those listening, evenif member of the audience had attended with the express intent of causingtrouble. Further, in Morpeth Ward Justices ex parte Ward (1992), the issue was
not so much the conduct of the protesters but, rather, whether or not theconduct had the effect of provoking violent behaviour, even where thereaction to the protest was unreasonable. However, in Nicol v Director of Public
Prosecutions (1996), the court adopted a more restrictive approach. The protest
in question concerned an attempt to stop anglers from fishing. The protestersblew horns and provoked the anglers. It was held that, although there wasChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
7029Duncan v Jones (1936).

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
nothing unlawful in the protesters’ actions, the provocation of the anglers was
likely to cause a breach of the peace because it was unreasonable action. 
However, in Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions (1999), three
women preachers, who were preaching on the steps of a cathedral, wereapproached by a police constable and warned not to stop people. Later, hereturned to find that a crowd had gathered, some of whom were hostile to thespeakers. The constable asked the women to stop preaching, but when theyrefused arrested them for a breach of the peace. They were convicted ofobstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty. On appeal, it was heldthat there was no lawful basis for the arrest. Free speech, provided that it didnot tend to provoke violence, irrespective of its content (unless contrary tolaw), was to be respected. There were no grounds on which the constablecould apprehend a breach of the peace, much less one for which the preacherswould be responsible.
The European Convention on Human Rights is making an impact on the
law of protest, both in terms of the right to liberty (Article 5) and the right tofreedom of expression (Article 10). See, for example, Steel and Others v United
Kingdom (1998) and Hashman and Harrup v United Kingdom (2000). In the
absence of obstruction or provocation of others to violence, their arrest anddetention was unlawful under Article 5 and also amounted to a violation ofArticle 10.
In Hashman and Harrup , the issue was freedom of expression relating to
hunt saboteurs. The applicants were bound over ‘to be of good behaviour’ forone year. The applicants claimed that the concept of behaviour contra bona
mores was so broadly defined that it did not comply with Article 10(2) of the
Convention, the requirement that any interference with freedom of expressionbe ‘prescribed by law’. The Court of Human Rights ruled that the definition ofcontra bona mores , as behaviour which was ‘wrong rather than right in the
judgment of the majority of contemporary fellow citizens’, was particularlyimprecise and failed to give the applicants sufficiently clear guidance as tohow they should behave in future. Accordingly, the interference with freedomof expression was not ‘prescribed by law’ and there had been a violation ofArticle 10.
Breach of the peace is a concept which traditionally has involved a degree
of proximity and immediacy between the conduct of individuals and theanticipated breach of the peace. However, in Moss v McLachlan (1985), in the
course of the miners’ strike 1984–85, the defendants were ordered to turn backon a journey to another colliery some four miles away. The police suspectedthat they were intending to join the picket line in support of fellow miners andthat a breach of the peace might occur. When the miners refused to obey theorder to turn back, they were arrested for obstruction. The judge conceded awide discretion to the police and ruled that, provided a senior police officer‘honestly and reasonably formed the opinion’ that there was a real risk of abreach of the peace, in an area proximate to the point of arrest, they could take

whatever measures were reasonably necessary to prevent it. This decision,
whilst understandable from the police’s point of view, is regrettable for itintroduces a dangerous breadth to the offence. Furthermore, uncertainty iscreated as to the precise scope of the police’s power to interfere with freedomof movement.
Obstructing the police
Under the Police Act 1996,10it is a criminal offence to obstruct the police in the
execution of their duty. Section 89 provides that:
(1) Any person who assaults a constable in the execution of his duty, or a
person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of
an offence ...
(2) Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the execution of
his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shallbe guilty of an offence ...
In Duncan v Jones (1935) ,the defendant had intended to hold a public meeting
at a place previously used for that purpose. The police, aware that a
disturbance had previously occurred in that place, instructed Mrs Duncan tohold the meeting on an alternative site. Mrs Duncan refused and started themeeting on the highway. She was arrested and charged under section 51 ofthe Police Act. The defendant could have been charged with obstruction of thehighway (see below) or with inciting a breach of the peace. However, in thealternative the police charged her with obstructing a police officer. The courtheld that, once the police officer reasonably considered that a breach of thepeace could occur, any action which impeded him in the course of preventingsuch an occurrence, amounted to an obstruction of the police. In Piddington v
Bates (1960), in the course of an industrial dispute, the police directed that no
more than two pickets should be allowed at each entrance to the factory. Thedefendant joined the picket line in defiance of the order, regarding therestriction as unreasonable, and was charged with obstruction. On appeal, theDivisional Court upheld his conviction. 
Obstructing the highway
The Highways Act 1980
A citizen is free to move along the highway. It is, however, a criminal offenceto obstruct the highway. Obstructing the highway also represents a publicnuisance, which may be prosecuted on indictment under common law.

highway he is guilty of an offence’.12InHirst v Chief Constable for West
Yorkshire (1986), animal rights demonstrators protesting outside a store selling
animal fur products were charged with obstructing the highway. The
magistrates’ court convicted them of obstruction. However, on appeal, theDivisional Court held that the justices should have considered thereasonableness of the action and weighed in the balance the right to protestand demonstrate and the need for public order. The magistrates’ court hadfailed to consider this and, accordingly, failed to respect the freedom toprotest on matters of public concern.
13
The Public Order Act 1986 and Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
The Public Order Act 1986 was passed after growing concern overdemonstrations, industrial disputes, riots and football hooliganism.
14The Act
had two principal objectives. The first was to provide a comprehensive codeas to the organisation and control of processions and demonstrations. Thesecond was to provide a code relating to disorderly conduct, which can rangefrom behaviour which causes alarm or distress to riot. In addition, the Actcreated offences relating to football hooliganism and to control of personsunlawfully camping on private land. 
The law relating to public order was further reformed substantially by the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
15This Act made major reforms
across a wide spectrum of criminal justice matters and matters relating tosexual offences. New sentences for young offenders were introduced; the rightto silence of defendants was curtailed; and the powers of police to take bodysamples increased. In relation to public order,
16the Act increased the powers
of the police and local authorities in respect of trespass, ‘rave parties’,squatters and campers, and marked a significant shift away from individualliberties towards increasing state regulation in favour of maintaining publicorder. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduces new criminal offenceswhere conduct contrary to public order is racially aggravated. See below.
The regulation of processions
A procession is not defined in the Public Order Act. Processions wereoriginally regulated under the Public Order Act 1936 and the powers were
70512 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, s 25(3)(d)(v) provides for a power of arrest.

extended under the Public Order Act 1986. In Flockhart v Robinson (1950), a
procession was said to be ‘not a mere body of persons: it is a body of persons
moving along a route’. Accordingly, a procession must involve more than oneperson. To be regulated by the Act, a procession must be public. A publicplace is defined in section 16 as being:
(a) any highway ...; and
(b) any place to which at the material time the public or any section of the
public has access, on payment or otherwise, as of right or by virtue of
express or implied permission.
The requirement of notice
Under section 11, notice must be given to the police of a procession which is
designed to express or oppose the views of another, to publicise or encouragesupport for a campaign, or to commemorate an event. Processions which areregularly held within a particular area need not be notified to the police.Where it is impracticable to give notice in advance, the requirement may bewaived. This exception enables spontaneous demonstrations to take place. 
Six clear days’ notice must be given, except where it is impracticable to do
so.
17Failure to give notice, or organising a procession different from the one
notified, is a summary offence. In Scotland, similar requirements exist. Underthe Civil Government (Scotland) Act 1982, as amended,
18the police must
receive at least seven days’ notice. Where a ban is imposed on a particularmarch, a right of appeal exists.
19
The power to impose conditions
Where notice has been given in accordance with section 11, then a seniorpolice office (Chief Constable or Commissioner) may impose conditions,under section 12. If a procession is under way, then a senior officer on thescene may impose conditions. The basis on which conditions may be attachedinclude situations where the senior police officer reasonably believes that aprocession may result in serious public disorder, serious damage to propertyor serious disruption of the life of the community.
20An alternative basis for
conditions is where it is reasonably believed that the procession is taking placefor an illegitimate purpose. Intimidation, for example, would be an‘illegitimate purpose’. Under section 14 of the Act, conditions may also – onthe same grounds as those stated in section 12 – be imposed on assemblies.
If the requirements for the imposition of conditions are met, the senior
officer has a wide discretion as to the conditions which may in fact beChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

imposed. Section 12(1) merely states that he may impose conditions ‘as appear
to him necessary’. Under section 12, there is power to impose conditions as tothe route to be followed, and to prohibit entry into particular public places.Failure to comply with the conditions, or to incite others not to comply, is anoffence.
21
The power to ban processions
Under section 13, the Chief Officer of Police22may issue a banning order,
which may only be issued if the power to impose conditions is insufficient toprevent serious public disorder. In London, the banning order must be withthe consent of the Home Secretary, elsewhere, with the consent of the localauthority. The power to ban processions represents a power to ban allprocessions, rather than to ban a particular procession, and can cover all or partof a police area and last for up to three months.
23Organising or participating
in, or inciting participation in, a banned procession is a summary offence.24
The power to enter meetings on private premises
Where a private meeting is held, the police have power to enter and remain onthe premises under certain circumstances. A meeting is defined as a privatemeeting if it is held in entirely enclosed premises. Thus, even if the meeting isheld in publicly owned and managed premises, such as a school or town hall,it will be a private meeting. In Thomas v Sawkins (1935), a police officer entered
a private meeting which was held to protest against the Incitement toDisaffection Bill. The organiser of the meeting brought an action based ontrespass, and argued that, as a result of trespass by the police, he had the rightto evict the officers. The meeting had not given rise to a breach of the peace.However, the court held that notwithstanding its peaceful nature, the policehad grounds for reasonably suspecting that a breach of the peace might occurand were therefore entitled to enter and remain on the premises.
The regulation of public assemblies25
While there is power to regulate a public assembly, there was no power toissue a banning order under the 1986 Act. However, section 70 of the CriminalJustice and Public Order Act 1994 inserted section 14A into the 1986 Act,which provided a power to ban assemblies. A public assembly is defined as

Commissioners (1981).
24 Public Order Act 1986, s 13(7), (8), (9).25 See Bonner and Stone, 1987.

‘an assembly of 20 or more persons in a public place which is wholly or partly
open to the air’.26However, an individual who disobeys an order, even where
he or she does not actually join the assembly, is liable under the Act.27The
basis on which the conditions which may be attached28are the same as those
for conditions imposed on processions. Intimidation, as a ground forimposing a condition, has been interpreted to mean more than ‘causingdiscomfort’.
29
Trespassory assemblies
A Chief Officer of Police may apply for a banning order if he reasonablybelieves that an assembly is likely to involve trespass or might result inserious disruption to community life or cause damage to buildings andstructures. This power must be seen within the context of section 14(c) of thePublic Order Act 1986,
30which confers power on the police to stop persons
within a five mile radius of the assembly, if the police reasonably believe thatthey are on their way to the assembly, and the assembly is subject to a section14A order.
In Director of Public Prosecutions v Jones (1999),section 14 was considered. A
section 14A order had been issued, which prohibited the holding of atrespassory assembly within a four mile radius of Stonehenge. The assemblywas heading for Stonehenge, and was within the four mile radius, and on thepublic highway. The court held that the highway was for passing andrepassing only, and that assembling on the highway was outside the purposefor which the implied licence to use the highway was granted. Therespondents argued that they were both peaceful and not obstructive andwere making ‘reasonable use’ of the highway. The House of Lords ruled, by amajority of three to two, that the public had the right to use the highway forsuch reasonable and usual activities, inter alia, including peaceful assembly, as
was consistent with the primary use for passage and repassage. It was aquestion of fact and degree in each case whether the user was reasonable andnot inconsistent with that primary right.
The right to move freely along the highway, for a minority group such as
Gypsies, entails the need for a lawful place to stop. While local authorities hadbeen under a duty to provide sites under the Caravan Sites Act 1968,
31the
government has now removed that statutory duty.32This is of particular
concern, given that Gypsies – a recognised racial group protected under theChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

Race Relations Act 1976 and under international law33– traditionally travel
with caravans from area to area, usually in search of seasonal work. 
The problems encountered in the 1970s and 1980s with groups of New
Age Travellers combining for the summer solstice at Stonehenge and the
problems caused by ‘rave parties’ resulted in the criminalisation of trespassfor the first time under English law. Section 39 of the Public Order Act 1986provided the police with powers to direct persons to leave land where theyhad entered land as trespassers, with a common purpose of remaining there,where steps had been taken by the occupier
34to ask them to leave. A further
requirement under section 39 was that the trespasser had caused damage toproperty on the land or had used threatening, abusive or insulting words orbehaviour towards the occupier and his associates, or that the trespassers hadbrought 12 or more vehicles onto the land. Failure to obey the instruction ofthe police to leave the land as soon ‘as reasonably practicable’
35amounted to a
criminal offence. A number of difficulties arose with the interpretation ofsection 39, and that section has been repealed and replaced by section 61 of theCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. A number of significantamendments have been made to the powers of the police.
First, whereas under the 1986 Act, persons could be directed to leave
where they had entered the land as trespassers, the 1994 Act makes it possibleto remove persons who are in fact trespassing, whether or not they entered theland as trespassers.
36Thus, even where persons originally entered land at the
invitation of the occupier, if they have subsequently become trespassers theycan be directed to leave the land. Secondly, whereas the 1986 Act provided fordamage to property on land as a criterion for a direction to leave, the 1994 Acthas extended the concept of damage to include damage to the land itself.Thirdly, the 1986 Act applied in relation to persons having 12 or more vehicleson the land: the 1994 Act reduces the number of vehicles to six. This is a majorchange and one of great disadvantage for the minority Gypsy populationwhich traditionally migrates in convoys of caravans. 
Fourthly, the Act extends the land to which the provisions apply.
Common land
37is now included, as are footpaths, bridleways, byways, public
paths and cycletracks.38Fifthly, section 62 of the 1994 Act has given the police
new powers to remove ‘vehicles and other property’ on land. The power toseize vehicles and property arises where the trespasser fails to comply with adirection to leave within a reasonable time. Reasonableness is an objective testand will depend on all the circumstances of the case, including the
70933Commission for Racial Equality v Dutton (1989), discussed above, p 661.

roadworthiness of vehicles.39Where vehicles are seized, powers are given for
the safe keeping, disposal and destruction of the vehicles, the powers to be
exercised according to Regulations to be drafted by the Secretary of State.40
The power of seizure and destruction was introduced by the government,
which was aware of the limitations of fines for non-compliance, andrecommended the seizure of caravans as a sanction ‘as a last resort’.Circumspection is appropriate here. The potential for harrowing scenes offamilies being physically wrenched from their homes and removal of thosehomes until ‘the offender(s) satisfied the court that he (they) either had a legalplace to camp or alternative accommodation’
41is great and chilling in its
contemplation. The cumulative effect will be that Gypsy families comply withthe request to leave, only to find themselves – in the absence of official sites –with no lawful place to stop. As Baroness Mallalieu stated in debate, ‘we arein very real danger of putting people in Britain in 1994 in the position of theroad sweeper in Bleak House in the last century who was forever being told to
move on but had nowhere to go’. The only alternative will be to submit toseizure of their homes, leaving them without a roof over their heads untilrehoused under the Housing Act 1985 provisions. Failure to leave land asdirected amounts to a criminal offence, for which arrest without warrant isprovided.
42
Rave parties
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 introduces new police powersto order persons to leave gatherings, creates a new criminal offence of failingto leave within a reasonable time and provides for arrest without warrant. Theprovisions govern open air gatherings of 100 or more persons, whereamplified music is played at night time. Failure to comply with a policedirection may result in the power to seize and remove vehicles and soundequipment.
43
The Act gives the police power to regulate the movement of persons to a
gathering. Where a direction has been made under section 63, the police maystop persons and order them not to proceed to the gathering. The exercise ofthis sweeping power is confined to an area within a five mile radius of thegathering.
Other public order offences under the 1986 Act
The Act replaces a number of common law offences. The Law Commissionconsidered, for example, that the offence of breach of the peace was too vagueChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
a concept and that it should be replaced with more specific offences. In its
place, the concept of unlawful violence is used, which encompasses a numberof situations. Violent conduct is defined as meaning any violent conduct,whether or not intended to cause injury or damage.
44
Riot
Riot is the most serious offence created under the Act. ‘Riot’ is defined insection 1 as being where 12 or more persons who are present together use orthreaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them(taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmnesspresent at the scene to fear for his personal safety; each of the persons usingunlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot.
Under section 1, a riot may be committed in private as well as public
places. The common purpose may be inferred from the conduct, and does notneed to be articulated. The purpose itself need not be unlawful – a perfectlylegitimate demonstration may turn into a riot if the conditions for a riot aresatisfied, namely the use of unlawful violence for a common purpose which issuch as to cause persons ‘of reasonable firmness’ present to fear for theirpersonal safety, although it is not necessary that such persons actually bepresent at the scene. The mental element required for liability, under section6(1), is that a person ‘intends to use violence or is aware that his conduct maybe violent’. The seriousness with which the offence is viewed is reflected inthe requirement of trial on indictment (trial by jury) and the liability onconviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or a fine, orboth.
45
Violent disorder
Section 2 of the Public Order Act 1986 creates a new statutory offence ofviolent disorder, which replaces the common law offence of unlawfulassembly. The offence shares similarities with the offence of riot, but differs inseveral respects. First, for the offence to be committed, there needs to be onlythree people, rather than 12 as required for a riot, involved in the violentconduct. Secondly, there needs to be no common purpose, as is required forthe offence of riot. It is sufficient for an offence of violent disorder to becommitted that the persons be involved in the use or threat of violent conduct.It is necessary that the conduct be such that it causes a person ‘of reasonablefirmness’ to ‘fear for his personal safety’, although such persons need notactually be present.
46The offence can be committed in private or public.47The
mental element required under section 6 is that the person intends to use or to
71144 Public Order Act 1986, s 8.
45Ibid, s 1(6).
46Ibid, s 2(3).
47Ibid, s 2(4).

threaten violence, or is aware that his conduct may be violent or threaten
violence. Self-induced intoxication, other than through prescribed medicationin a course of medical treatment, is not an excuse.
The requirement of three person’s involvement in the violent disorder has
caused difficulties. In R v Fleming (1989), for example, four persons were
charged, one was acquitted and the jury failed to reach a decision on a second.Accordingly, the conviction of the remaining two defendants was quashed.
48
The Court of Appeal in Fleming noted that it was possible for less than three
persons to be convicted where, for example, there was sufficient evidence asto the involvement of more than three persons but some of the greater numberevaded arrest or lacked the required mental element for the offence. The jurymust be correctly directed on the matter, and failure to direct appropriatelywill cause a conviction to be quashed. This occurred in R v Whorton (1990) ,
where there was evidence that eight to ten people were involved in theviolence, but only four were charged and only two convicted. Their appealagainst conviction was successful, on the basis that the judge had not directedthe jury that they could only convict if there were either three defendantsbefore them, or if a lesser number, that a greater number had in fact beeninvolved in the violent disorder.
The offence is triable on indictment (by the Crown Court) or summarily
(by a magistrates’ court), and carries a term of imprisonment of up to fiveyears on indictment, a fine or both and, on summary conviction,imprisonment of up to six months or a fine, or both.
49
Affray
A person is guilty of an affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violencetowards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person ofreasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
50
Two or more persons may be involved in the offence, in which case it is
necessary that their conduct be considered together for the purpose of section1. A verbal threat of unlawful violence is not sufficient for the offence to becommitted. The offence may take place in private or in public and, again, thetest for unlawful violence is whether a person of reasonable firmness, whoneed not in fact be present, is put in fear for his personal safety. The mentalelement is the same as that required for violent disorder. Police constablesmay arrest without warrant, and the offence is triable on indictment orsummarily. On indictment, the offence carries a term of imprisonment notexceeding three years or a fine or both; on summary conviction, there isliability to imprisonment of up to six months or a fine or both.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
The definition of affray was considered by the Court of Appeal in R v
Sanchez (1996). On the charge of affray, the trial judge directed the jury on the
requirement for a ‘person of reasonable firmness’ and said that the victim was
such a person and that he was to be believed when he said that he wasfrightened. The Court of Appeal held that there was a misdirection, in that thejudge’s directions overlooked the need to direct the jury to consider not onlythe victim but also the putative third person, the hypothetical bystander;affray was a public order offence and there were other offences for theprotection of persons at whom the violence was aimed.
Fear or provocation of violence
Under section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986, a person is guilty of an offence ifhe:
(a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or
behaviour; or
(b) distributes or displays to another person any writing, sign or other visible
representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, with the intent to
cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be usedagainst him or another by any person, or to provoke the immediate use ofunlawful violence by that person or another, or whereby that person islikely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that suchviolence will be provoked.
The offence is one which may be committed by a single person. For a
prosecution to succeed, it is necessary to establish that threatening, abusive orinsulting words or behaviour have been directed towards a specific person.Rude or offensive words or behaviour may not necessarily be insulting, andswearing may not be abusive.
52It is also necessary to establish that the person
affected is caused to believe that immediate unlawful violence is about to beused against him. In Horseferry Road Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex parte
Siadatan (1990), it was held that the violence feared must be both immediate
and unlawful.
53A threat of violence at some future time will not suffice for
this offence to be proven. The mental element required under section 6 is thatthe person intends his words or behaviour (or signs, etc) to be threatening,abusive or insulting or that he is aware that it may be threatening, abusive orinsulting.
Harassment, alarm or distress54
Under section 5 of the Act, a person is guilty of an offence if he:
(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly
behaviour; or
71352R v Ambrose (1973).
53 See, further, p 715 below.
54 See Criminal Law: Offences Relating to Public Order , Law Com No 123, 1983, and Williams,
1984.

(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is
threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person
likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.
The introduction of this offence,55and the use to which it is put by the police,
raises controversy. The offence was designed to provide powers to deal with
relatively minor acts of antisocial, unruly or disorderly conduct which, whileof itself not serious, cause fear in others. In its White Paper, the governmentillustrated the sort of behaviour which was being targeted:
56
(a) hooligans on housing estates causing disturbances in the common parts of
blocks of flats ...;
(b) groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities or pestering
people waiting to catch public transport or to enter a hall or cinema;
someone turning out the lights in a crowded dance hall, in a way likely tocause panic;
(c) rowdy behaviour in the streets late at night which alarms local residents.
For the offence to be proven, it is necessary that the words or behaviour, or
signs etc, are uttered or displayed within the sight of a person who is likely tobe harassed or alarmed or distressed – it is not necessary to prove actualharassment, alarm or distress. However, the mental element required is thatthe person using the words, behaviour or signs either intended his conduct tobe threatening, abusive or insulting or be aware that it might be. Thus, wordsuttered in a public place (for example, by demonstrators or persons attendingfootball matches) which might in fact be threatening or abusive, and might infact cause alarm or distress to someone hearing the words will not besufficient for a prosecution to succeed.
57
In Jordan v Borgoyne (1963),the accused made an inflammatory racist
speech in Trafalgar Square. He was prosecuted under the forerunner tosection 4 of the Public Order Act 1986, section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936.It was held that the speech went beyond the limits of tolerance. The defendantcould not argue that the words used were not likely to cause ordinary personsto commit breaches of the peace. The defendant had to ‘take his audience ashe found them’. If the words used were likely to provoke that audience, orpart thereof, to commit a breach of the peace, the defendant was guilty of anoffence. 
Insulting words were the subject of judicial scrutiny in Brutus v Cozens
(1973). In Brutus , the defendant and other anti-apartheid protesters
interrupted play at a Wimbledon tennis match. The audience resented theinterruption. Brutus was charged with insulting behaviour likely to cause abreach of the peace. In the Divisional Court, it was held that an offenceChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
71455 There existed a predecessor offence, but the Public Order Act 1986, s 5, broadens the
scope of the offence.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
occurred where the behaviour affronted other people, and reflected a
contempt for their rights. The House of Lords, however, allowed Brutus’sappeal. Not all speech or conduct fell within the meaning of the section. Itmust be conduct or speech which the ordinary person would recognise asinsulting – a term which was deemed incapable of precise definition. Themere resentment of the crowd, as opposed to violence, did not suffice to makethe actions insulting.
The issue of violent reaction to provocative words was considered in R v
Horseferry Road Magistrate ex parte Siadatan (1991). The case concerned Salman
Rushdie’s novel, The Satanic Verses . In an application laid against the
publishers and the author, it was argued that distribution of the bookoffended against section 4 of the 1986 Act, in so far as it contained abusive andinsulting language which was likely to provoke violence amongst devoutMuslims. The magistrate refused to issue a summons. The issue went to theDivisional Court for judicial review. It was there held that the violence whichwas apprehended by the words must be immediate violence, not some distantact of violence. 
In R v Stephen Miller (1999), the defendant appealed against sentence for
racially aggravated threatening words. The defendant had pleaded guilty totwo offences, first, aggravated threatening words and behaviour contrary tosection 4 of the Public Order Act 1986, as amended by section 31 of the Crimeand Disorder Act 1998, and, secondly, travelling on a railway without a ticket.He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, and appealed. The Court ofAppeal dismissed his appeal. His conduct towards the conductor on the trainwas particularly bad. The sentence was designed to reflect public concernabout conduct which damaged good racial relations within the community.
The mental element on the part of the accused must be satisfied. KA
Ewing and CA Gearty provide illustrations of the uses to which section 5 hasbeen put.
58The Act has been used to curb the use of obscene T-shirts and hats;
to suppress a satirical poster of the former Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher; andto prosecute protesters outside abortion clinics in Ireland.

Ewing’s assessment, section 5 of the Act represents a ‘mechanism forpunishing non-violent non-conformity for the crime of being itself’.
60It must
be conceded that section 5 represents a serious, and hitherto uncontemplated,limitation of freedom of expression and an alteration of the balance betweenindividual liberty and the legitimate expectations of citizens to be protectedfrom the consequences of another person’s words and actions. The extent towhich the balance has been correctly struck is a matter for personal judgment.

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
Sections 28 to 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 extend the law to
encompass racially aggravated offences.61It is an offence under sections 4 and
5 of the Public Order Act 1986 (fear of provocation of violence, intentionalharassment, alarm or distress) to engage in racially aggravated conduct.Section 32 makes it an offence to act in a racially aggravated manner inrelation to sections 2 and 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Undersection 28(1), an offence is racially aggravated if:
(a) at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing
so, the offender demonstrates towards the victim of the offence hostility
based on the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) of a racialgroup; or
(b) the offence is motivated (wholly or partly) by hostility towards members
of a racial group based on their membership of that group.
Section 28(3) provides that:
It is immaterial ... whether or not the offender’s hostility is also based, to anyextent, on –
(a) the fact of presumption that any person or group of persons belongs to any
religious group ...
Under section 82, the court may impose a higher penalty for racially
aggravated offences.
PART II – THE POLICE AND POLICE POWERS
THE ORGANISATION OF THE POLICE62
The United Kingdom has no national police force. Instead, the police areorganised on a basis which links the police to the locality. In England andWales, there now exist 43 police forces: the City of London Police, theMetropolitan Police and 41 forces outside London. Scotland has six forces andNorthern Ireland one. The Police Act 1996 provides that the Home Secretarymay alter police areas ‘in the interest of efficiency or effectiveness’.
63In 1962, a
Royal Commission examined the question whether there should be a nationalpolice force under central government control, but concluded that the statusquo should be maintained, subject to supervision by central government.
64Chapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
71661 In 1999–2000, of 2,417 cases prosecuted, over 40 per cent were for racially aggravated
crimes under the 1998 Act: Crown Prosecution Service, Press Release, 1 March 2001.

64 Cmd 1728. The Human Rights Act 1998 imposes additional duties on the police. See
below.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
The regulation of the police represents a tri-partite arrangement involving the
Home Secretary, local police authorities and Chief Constables of Police. 
THE HOME SECRETARY
The Home Secretary and Metropolitan Police
Until 1999, the Home Secretary was the police authority for the MetropolitanPolice. Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999, on which see Chapter12, there is established a Metropolitan Police Authority, which replaces theHome Secretary as police authority.
65The 1999 Act amends the Police Act
1996, introducing a Police Authority for the Metropolitan Police District andspecifying membership of the Authority. The Authority is headed by theCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis, appointed by the Crown andholding office at Her Majesty’s pleasure.
66The Metropolitan Police Force is
under the direction and control of the Commissioner. There is established aDeputy Commissioner who has the power to exercise any or all of the powersand duties of the Commissioner during any absence from duty of theCommission, any vacancy in the office of the Commissioner or at any othertime with the consent of the Commissioner.
67
The Home Secretary and other police authorities
Each of the local police forces has its own police authority, the role of which isdiscussed below. The Home Secretary, however, has a number of powers inrelation to local forces. The Home Secretary may, in consultation with thepolice authority and Chief Constable, determine policy objectives for thepolicy authority.
68The Home Secretary may issue Codes of Practice which
regulate the manner in which the police authority pursues policy objectives,69
may direct the authority to establish performance targets and may imposeconditions on police authorities.
70In addition, section 57 of the 1994 Act
extends previous powers71of the Home Secretary to provide and maintain
‘such organisations, facilities and services’ as the Home Secretary thinksnecessary for promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the police.
72The
Police Act 1996 also extends the powers of the Home Secretary, and provides

that the Home Secretary may make regulations for the government,
administration and conditions of service of police forces.73
Police authorities are funded by central government. The annual grant is
determined by the Home Secretary with the approval of the Treasury.Formerly, the grant amounted to 51 per cent of approved expenses. Now, theHome Secretary has a wide discretion, under section 46 of the 1996 Act, as tothe amount of the grant. The efficiency of police forces is under the jurisdictionof Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary appointed by the Home Secretaryand accountable to him.
74
Codes of Practice, notes for guidance and Home Office circulars
Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a number of Codes ofPractice have been issued. The Codes do not have the force of law, butrepresent an administrative means of regulating differing aspects of policepowers. Breach of the Codes does not give rise to civil or criminal liability.
75
Under the 1984 Act, there are five Codes of Practice. Code A relates to stopand search procedures; Code B to the search of premises; Code C relates tointerviews and conditions of detention; Code D regulates identificationprocedures; and Code E regulates the tape recording of interviews. The notesfor guidance are not part of the Codes, but represent interpretative guidelines.Home Office circulars are designed to supplement the provisions of the Policeand Criminal Evidence Act and other statutes. 
The functions of police authorities
Local police authorities are responsible for setting policy objectives for thepolice, subject to the Home Secretary’s power to determine the objectives forpolice authorities.
76The general function is ‘to secure the maintenance of an
efficient and effective police force for its area’.77The police authority is
responsible for ensuring the efficiency of the local force.78The composition of
the police authority is now regulated by the Police Act 1996. The standardmembership of the authority is 17, of which nine are local authoritycouncillors. Five further members are appointed from a shortlist drawn up bythe Home Secretary. The remaining three members are local magistrates andappointed by the magistrates collectively. The police authority has controlover the police budget.Chapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

77Ibid, s 6(1).
78Ibid, s 6.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
The police authority has the power to order a Chief Constable or Assistant
Chief Constable to retire ‘in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness’,
following consultation with, and the approval of, the Home Secretary.79The
Home Secretary also has power to require a police authority to exercise thepowers. The police authority reports annually to the Home Secretary.
80
Chief Constables of Police
Outside the Metropolitan area, which is headed by the MetropolitanCommissioner of Police, police forces are under the operational control ofChief Constables.
81The Chief Constable is responsible for recruitment and
promotions to the ranks below that of Assistant Chief Constable, and exercisesdisciplinary powers over the police. The Chief Constable makes annualreports to the police authority,
82and the Home Secretary can require the Chief
Constable to submit reports.83
Section 88 of the Police Act 1996 makes it clear that Chief Constables are
liable for torts committed by constables under his direction and control:
The chief officer of police for a police area shall be liable in respect of torts
committed by constables under his direction and control in the performance orpurported performance of their functions in like manner as a master is liable inrespect of torts committed by his servants in the course of their employment,and accordingly shall in respect of any such tort be treated for all purposes as ajoint tortfeasor. 
The legal status of police officers
A police officer is a servant of the state.84He or she is not employed under a
contract of employment, but is a holder of public office.85Police officers are
not servants of the Chief Constable.86
Prior to the enactment of section 88 of the Police Act 1996, the liability of a
police officer for wrongful actions was personal. Whilst a servant of the
Crown, the Crown was not, at common law, vicariously liable for wrongfulactions of officers because, being neither appointed nor paid by the Crown,the officer was not ‘in the employment of the Crown’. Where damages or costsare ordered in legal action, these are awarded against the Chief Constable andpaid out of the local police budget.

Police officers hold office under statute, and are subject to the police
disciplinary code. They are not allowed to belong to trade unions, or any other
association concerned with levels of pay or conditions of employment. PoliceFederations represent police officers in matters relating to welfare, and haverestricted powers in relation to police discipline.
87Police officers are not
permitted to take any active part in politics, nor participate in any otheractivity which could actually impede, or give the suggestion that it couldimpede, the officer’s impartiality.
88
Co-operation between police forces
Co-operation between police forces is facilitated by the Association of ChiefPolice Officers. The Police Act 1997 established a National Intelligence Serviceand National Crime Squad, the former to gather and disseminate informationconcerning serious crime to local forces, the latter of which has powers inrelation to the prevention and detection of serious crime which may affectmore than one police area. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, section85, created a new Central Police Training and Development Authority to‘design, deliver and accredit’ training programmes.
Note also that the Treaty on European Union 1997 increases the powers of
Europol and provides for closer co-operation between police forces andCustoms and Excise to combat crime.
Judicial control and police policy
The exercise of police discretion is reviewable by the courts, although thecourts confer a great deal of latitude in relation to that discretion. In R v
Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn (No 1) (1968) ,the
Court of Appeal made it clear that an order of mandamus would lie againstthe Metropolitan Police Commissioner. The Commissioner had issued apolicy statement in which he made it clear that supervision of gambling clubswould not take place, other than where there was a suspicion that the clubswere being frequented by criminals. The applicant, Blackburn, claimed thatillegal gambling was taking place and applied to the courts for an order ofmandamus to compel the Commissioner to reverse his policy. The courtinsisted that the Commissioner had a public duty to enforce the law, and thathis discretion could be controlled by the courts. Nevertheless, since theCommissioner had undertaken to reverse his former policy, the order wouldnot be granted. Neither was mandamus ordered in R v Commissioner of Police
for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn (No 3) (1973) .In that case, the applicant
sought to compel, by order of the court, enforcement of the ObsceneChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Publications Act 1959. However, the Chief Office had increased the numbers
in the vice squad, and reorganised its working methods.
Police discretion returned for consideration in R v Chief Constable of Sussex
ex parte International Traders’ Ferry Ltd (1997). In that case, animal rights
protesters, concerned about the welfare of live animal exports, blockadedports in order to stop the exports. To assist the exporter, the police deployed1,125 officers, a level of policing which was maintained for some ten days. Inorder to maintain the operation, seven other police forces assisted.
89The cost
of the operation amounted to £1.25 million. The Home Office refused to makea special grant to assist with the financial cost of the operation. In April, theChief Constable indicated that new arrangements would have to be made,which would involve the company having to reduce its shipments. Thecompany sought judicial review of the Chief Constable’s decision. The Courtof Appeal upheld the Divisional Court’s refusal to interfere with the decisionof the Chief Constable. In light of the circumstances, the Chief Constable’sdecision could not be ‘regarded as so unreasonable as to enable a court tointerfere’. The Court approved the statement of Neill LJ in Harris v Sheffield
United Football Club Ltd (1987):
I see the force of the argument that the court must be very slow before it
interferes in any way with a decision of a chief constable about the dispositionof his forces.
The House of Lords affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Complaints against the police
Part IV of the Police Act 1996 regulates police complaints and discipline.
Under sections 68–69, where a complaint is made against a police officerbelow the rank of Chief Superintendent, these are submitted to the ChiefOfficer of the force, who has powers to investigate. Where a complaint ismade regarding an officer of the rank of Chief Superintendent or above, thecomplaint is submitted to the Police Complaints Authority and the Authoritysupervises the investigation of the complaint, which is conducted by a policeofficer from a different police force than that to which the officer who issubject to the complaint belongs.
In relation to the powers and duties of the Chief Officer, the procedure to
be followed is dependent upon the categorisation of the complaint. If acomplaint is classified as relatively minor, the Chief Officer may decide thatthe complaint may be resolved informally. No complaint can be dealt withunder the informal procedure unless the complainant agrees, and thecomplaint does not involve conduct which would justify a criminal ordisciplinary charge. Where the complaint is more serious and cannot beresolved under the informal procedure, the Chief Officer must have the
72189 Under the Police Act 1964 (now the Police Act 1996, s 24).

complaint investigated, either by a member of his or her own force, or by a
member of a different force. If the investigation reveals that a criminal offencemight have been committed and the officer should be charged with thatoffence, the report is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
90If the
Director of Public Prosecutions decides that prosecution is justified, the matterwill go to trial. Irrespective of whether the defendant is convicted or acquitted,no disciplinary charge can then be brought against the officer relating tomatters substantially the same as those raised in the prosecution.
91
The third category of cases involves allegation of serious crime. Where
there is an allegation that an officer has caused death or serious injury, thecomplaint must be referred to the police authority.
92Other allegations
involving assault occasioning serious bodily harm, corruption, or a seriousarrestable offence
93must also be referred to the authority.94Where a matter is
referred to the authority, the authority appoints an investigating officer andsupervises the investigation. Disciplinary proceedings may result in areprimand, fine, reduction in rank, the requirement to resign or dismissal.
Legal liability of the police95
In addition to making complaints about police conduct, the police are liable inlaw in actions for assault, wrongful arrest,
96false imprisonment, trespass,
public misfeasance, negligence or an action for the return of property whichhas been wrongfully taken. An action for malicious prosecution is availablewhere a person believes that the police have maliciously and withoutreasonable cause abused their powers in recommending prosecution to theCrown Prosecution Service. Further, the police are liable in law for the care ofthose in their custody.
97
The European Convention on Human Rights and the police98
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates Convention rights. The Conventionhad already had an impact on the liability of police. The European Court ofHuman Rights ruled, in Osman v United Kingdom (1998), that Article 6 had
been violated in respect of the effect of the police’s immunity from civilChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
72290 Police Act 1996, s 73 in relation to junior officers, s 74 in relation to senior officers, and
s 75 on the procedure to be followed after investigation on complaints against junior
officers.

actions under the rule formulated in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire
Police (1989). The applicant alleged that there had been violations relating to
Articles 2, 6 and 8 of the Convention. The applicant’s son had become the
object of attachment on the part of a schoolteacher, and the family hadsuffered criminal damage to their home; the police visited the school but tookno further action. Subsequently, the teacher was questioned by police inrelation to missing school files. Following damage to the family’s home andother incidents, the police again questioned the teacher. In 1988, the teacherwent to the Osmans’ home, where he shot and killed the applicant’s husbandand injured her son. He then shot and injured the deputy headmaster andshot and killed his son. 
In 1989, the applicant commenced a civil action against the police. In 1992,
the Court of Appeal upheld the request of the police that the statement ofclaim be struck out, on the basis that, according to the ruling in Hill, no action
could lie for public policy reasons against the police for their negligence in theinvestigation and suppression of crime. 
The Court of Human Rights ruled that, in relation to Article 2, there was
no violation of the Convention, inter alia, because of the difficulty in policing
modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operationalchoices which the police had to make. Any obligation to protect the right tolife of the applicant’s husband had to be interpreted in a way which did notimpose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Inrespect of Article 8, which was allegedly breached by the failure of the policeto protect the family, no violation was found. The Court ruled that, given thefinding in relation to Article 2, it followed that there had been no violation ofany implied positive obligation under Article 8. In relation to Article 6,however, the Court ruled unanimously that the application of theexclusionary rule constituted a disproportionate restriction on the applicant’sright of access to a court.
In Price v United Kingdom (2001), the Court of Human Rights ruled that the
detention of a severely disabled person in unsuitable conditions at a policestation and subsequent detention in prison in similar conditions amounted todegrading treatment contrary to Article 3. The authorities admitted that theywere unable to cope with the applicant’s special needs. There was no evidenceof any positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant. However, todetain a seriously disabled person in such conditions which risked her healthconstituted a violation of Article 3. See, also, Edwards v United Kingdom (2002),
in which the United Kingdom was found to have violated Article 2 through itsfailure to protect the life of a prisoner killed in his cell by a fellow inmate whohad a history of violence and had been diagnosed schizophrenic. There hadbeen a failure on the part of the agencies involved to pass on informationabout the victim, who had been tentatively diagnosed as schizophrenic, andfailures in the mechanisms designed to protect prisoners. A private, non-statutory inquiry had been established to investigate and report on the death,
723

the proceedings of which were defective and violated the procedural
obligation of Article 1 to hold an effective investigation into the victim’s death.There was also a violation of Article 13, in that the victim’s parents had noavenue through which to secure an enforceable award of compensation forthe damage suffered.
99
POLICE POWERS IN RELATION TO THE 
DETECTION AND INVESTIGATION OF CRIME
Questioning by the police
It is a fundamental rule that the citizen is not obliged to answer policequestions, unless there is lawful justification for official interference with thecitizen’s liberty. The rule was endorsed in Rice v Connolly (1966). There, the
appellant was questioned by the police. He refused to answer questions andwas, accordingly, arrested for obstructing a police officer in the execution ofhis duty contrary to section 51(3) of the Police Act 1964.
100On appeal, Lord
Parker CJ stated that a citizen has every right to refuse to answer questions;generally the citizen has a ‘right to silence’. 
In Kenlin v Gardiner (1967) ,the issue in question concerned whether a
person could lawfully be stopped in the street by the police. Police officersattempted to question two boys. One of the boys tried to run away,whereupon a police constable tried physically to stop him and a scuffle brokeout. The boys were charged with assaulting a police constable in the executionof his duty. There was no question that an assault on the police had occurred.The question for decision was whether the assault by the boys was justified.The Divisional Court held that the attempt to restrain the boy amounted to anassault by the police officer, and was, accordingly, an unlawful attempt todetain him. As such, the police officer was not acting in the course of his dutyand, as a result, the boys were not guilty of assaulting a police officer ‘in theexecution of his duty’. A distinction must be made between a refusal toanswer questions and conduct which amounts to obstruction of the police;see, further, below.
There are, however, situations in which a citizen is under a duty to answer
questions. For example, under road traffic law,
101there is a duty to give
information as to one’s name and address, and a refusal to do so and to giveup one’s driving licence and other motoring documents is an offence. Otherthan under statutory authority, however, there is a right to silence.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Power exists to stop motorists on any ground,103and failure to stop is an
offence.104A police officer is entitled to immobilise a car by removing the
ignition keys. The vehicle owner may be detained in order to allow the officer
sufficient time to determine whether an arrest is to be made, to effect arrest,and to give reasons for the arrest. Moreover, the police have the power todetain a motorist in order to administer a breathalyser test.
105Powers also
exist under the Official Secrets Act 1911, whereby the Home Secretary cangrant the police permission to question suspects. Refusal to answer questionsin respect of inquiries made under the Companies Act 1985 and under theCriminal Justice Act 1987 in respect of investigations into fraud amount to acriminal offence, as can refusal to disclose information under the Preventionof Terrorism Acts
106and the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1984.
Stop and search powers
Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the police have been giventhe power to stop and search a person reasonably suspected of carryingprohibited articles such as offensive weapons and/or housebreakingequipment or stolen goods.
107The police also have the power to set up road
blocks108if there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that a person in the
area has committed a serious arrestable offence (see further, below, p 731 ff),or that a serious arrestable offence is about to be committed, or that a person isunlawfully ‘at large’.
109Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994 provides that powers may be given to the police, by a police officerof the rank of superintendent or above, to stop and search persons andvehicles, where that officer reasonably believes that incidents involvingserious violence may take place in any locality in his area, and that it isexpedient so to do to prevent their occurrence. The authorisation lasts for upto 24 hours. If no superintendent is available, a Chief Inspector or Inspectormay grant authorisation for the stop and search, if ‘he reasonably believes thatincidents involving serious violence are imminent’.

1985,111the Act provides that authorisation for the bugging of property may
be given on the basis that it would facilitate the ‘prevention and detection of
serious crime’, which cannot ‘reasonably be achieved by other means’.112No
exemptions from the provisions are made: thus, solicitors’ offices, doctors’surgeries and even Roman Catholic confessionals may fall victims of buggingby the police. Authorisation must be given by the Chief Officer of Police
113or,
if he is unavailable, by an officer of Chief Constable rank.114Written
authorisations remain in effect for three months whereas, in cases ofemergency, oral authorisation may be made which will remain in force for 72hours. Following opposition to the Bill, the government accepted thatindependent commissioners
115should review the authorisations. Such review
does not, however, necessarily precede police action on the warrant. In caseswhere private dwellings, hotel bedrooms or offices are involved, acommissioner’s prior approval for the authorisation is required. Priorapproval is also required where the surveillance may result in the revealing ofconfidential personal information, confidential journalistic material or matterswhich are subject to legal privilege.
116
THE PROTECTION OF SUSPECTS
Helping the police with inquiries117
In law, the police have no power to detain a person in order to make inquiries.Section 29 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act clarifies this rule. A personis either at will to leave a police station where he voluntarily attends to assistthe police, or the police must arrest him. If a person is detained by the police,he must be informed immediately that he is under arrest, and given reasonsfor the arrest, the absence of which may render the arrest unlawful.
The identification of suspects
One of the principal causes of wrongful conviction lies in the wrongfulidentification of suspects.
118Identification may take place by witnessing, or
by fingerprinting and the taking of bodily samples. Code of Practice Dgoverns the procedures to be followed, although Code D does not regulatethose detained as terrorist suspects under section 14 or Schedule 5 to theChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, save for the
provisions relating to fingerprinting and bodily samples. 
Identification by identity parade is the most reliable means of
identification, and will be carried out if the defendant requests it or consentsto it. If it is impracticable to hold an identity parade,
119perhaps because there
is a large number of suspects or because there are insufficient people withrelevant characteristics to the suspect,
120the police may then turn to
alternative means of identification. Identification by witness may be effectedby arranging for the witness to see the suspect in a group, generally in apublic place away from the police station. The consent of the suspect isrequired, but his or her failure to consent does not prohibit the use of groupidentification. Alternatively, identification may be by video identification.Face to face confrontation of the witness and accused may take place providedidentification is not possible by any other means.
Search of the person
Before 1984, there was considerable doubt about the breadth of power tosearch an arrested person. The police had a common law power to search aperson if they reasonably believed that he was carrying a weapon or evidencerelevant to the crime of which he was suspected. Resisting a lawful searchwould amount to obstruction of the police. In Lindley v Rutter (1980) ,the
police, having arrested the defendant while drunk, insisted on searching herperson and attempted to remove her bra. Ms Lindley resisted the attempt andscratched and bit a police woman. On a charge of obstruction of the police, themagistrates’ court convicted Ms Lindley. On appeal, however, the convictionwas quashed. While it was conceded that the police were under a duty not toallow a person to escape, or to destroy evidence, the lawfulness of their actiondepended upon the circumstances of the case. This personal search, whichwas highly unlikely to yield any evidence, required strong justification. Underthe circumstances the police had exceeded their powers. In Brazil v Chief
Constable of Surrey (1983), the police also attempted to search a woman, in the
course of which she assaulted the officers. The police claimed that the searchwas necessary, first, to ensure the detainee’s own safety and, secondly, todiscover whether she was carrying drugs. The search was ruled unlawful.There was no need for the search and, in relation to the search for drugs, thedetainee had not been informed of the police’s reasons for the search. Herconviction for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty wasquashed.

Search of an arrested person under the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984
Section 32 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides that searches
may be made of an arrested person, the premises on which he or she wasarrested and any vehicle in which the suspect was arrested. The grounds forthe search are for evidence relating to any offence, or for evidence which mayassist the escape of the suspect.

Intimate body searches are also permitted under section 55 of the 1984 Act.
The search must be carried out by a doctor, unless a senior officer believes thatthat is impracticable. The search may only be made for articles which maycause injury or for class ‘A’ drugs. The powers to search the person, andpersonal samples which may be taken, have been extended by the CriminalJustice and Public Order Act 1994. Section 58 extends the definition of intimateand non-intimate samples which may be taken. An intimate sample is one ofblood; semen or any other tissue fluid; urine; pubic hair; a dental impression;or a swab taken from a person’s orifice other than the mouth.
122A non-
intimate sample means a sample of hair other than pubic hair; a sample takenfrom a nail or from under the nail; a swab taken from any part of a person’sbody including the mouth but not other body orifice; saliva; or a footprint or asimilar impression of any part of a person’s body other than a part of hishand.
123
The conditions of interviews
The Code of Practice on the Detention, Treatment, and Questioning of Personsby Police Officers (Code C) provides that a suspect should be given eighthours in any 24 hours free of questioning. Breaks for refreshment should begiven regularly (every two hours), unless such breaks would adversely affectthe inquiries. Persons who are mentally disordered and children should beinterviewed in the presence of a competent adult. The detention must bereviewed regularly, the first taking place after six hours from the time oflawful detention; subsequent reviews to be conducted at intervals of no morethan nine hours. 
Tape recording of interviews124
The tape recording of police interviews acts as a protection for the personbeing questioned, and as protection for the police against accusations ofoppression. Tape recording is regulated by a code of practice.

defence and prosecution have the right to listen to tape recordings, although
the police provide summaries of the recordings.126The police must maintain
proper records of any interview, including the time of commencement andending and any breaks in questioning. The person interviewed must beallowed to read the record. 
The caution
The caution to be administered is laid down in the Criminal Justice and PublicOrder Act 1994, and reads:
You do not have to say anything. But, if you do not mention now something
which you later use in your defence, the court may decide that your failure tomention it now strengthens the case against you. A record will be made ofanything you say and it may be given in evidence if you are brought totrial.
127
Arrest
A lawful arrest is an arrest for which there is legal authority. Three categories
of lawful arrest exist: arrest under warrant; arrest without warrant undercommon law and arrest without a warrant under statute. Where a person hasbeen wrongly arrested and detained under statute,
128the person detained in
entitled to damages: Roberts v Chief Constable of Cheshire Constabulary (1999);
Woodward v Chief Constable, Fife Constabulary (1998).
Arrest under warrant
Section 1(1) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 provides that a warrant forarrest may be made on the basis that a ‘person has, or is suspected of having,committed an offence’. The warrant should not be issued unless the offence isindictable
129or punishable by imprisonment.130
Arrest without warrant: common law
The only common law power to arrest without warrant is where there arereasonable grounds for suspicion that a breach of the peace is about to occur,or has been committed and is likely to continue or to reoccur.
131If violence
has occurred, or is about to occur to persons or property, a police officer mayreasonably believe that a breach of the peace is about to occur. If a breach ofthe peace has occurred, but has ceased, the power to arrest ceases.

In Trevor Foulkes v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police (1998), the Court of
Appeal considered the issue of reasonable grounds in law for the arrest and
subsequent detention of a person in relation to an apprehended breach of thepeace. The police officer had arrested the appellant in the course of a domesticincident, honestly believing that arrest was necessary to prevent a breach ofthe peace. The Court of Appeal ruled that, where there was no actual breachof the peace but only an apprehended breach, the power of arrest was only tobe exercised in the clearest of circumstances where the officer was satisfiedthat a breach of the peace was imminent. The arresting officer in this caseacted honestly but did not have reasonable grounds for the arrest. Arrest wasan inappropriate management of a dispute between husband and wife in thefamily home.
An apprehended breach of the peace was also central to the decision in
Bibby v Chief Constable of Essex Police (2000). A bailiff had gone to a debtor’s
premises for the purpose of seizing assets due under a liability order issued bya magistrates’ court. The debtor threatened to call his friends to prevent theremoval of goods. Fearing a breach of the peace, a police constable, who hadbeen called to the premises, ordered the bailiff to leave. When the bailiffrefused, he was arrested and led away to the police station in handcuffs. Hewas later released without charge. The bailiff sued the police for assault andwrongful imprisonment. The Court of Appeal considered the conditions to bemet in order to exercise the ‘now exceptional’ common law power of arrest.These included:
• There must be the clearest of circumstances and a sufficiently real and
present threat to the peace to justify the extreme step of depriving of his
liberty a citizen who is not at the time acting unlawfully.132
• The threat must be coming from the person who is to be arrested.133
• The conduct must clearly interfere with the rights of others.• The natural consequence of the conduct must be violence from a third
party.
• The violence from the third party must not be wholly unreasonable.• The conduct of the person to be arrested must be unreasonable.
134
In the instant case, the bailiff was acting lawfully and attempting to enforce an
order of a court. Although the constable reasonably came to the conclusionthat a breach of the peace was imminent he had failed to consider where thethreat was coming from. Accordingly, neither the arrest nor the use ofhandcuffs was justified.

Arrest without warrant under statute
Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 defines the power of
arrest without warrant for serious offences. 
A person may be arrested without warrant under the following
circumstances:
(a) he or she is conspiring to commit, or attempting to commit, or inciting,
aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence
under section 24(2);
(b) he or she is in the act of committing an arrestable offence;(c) where the arrestable offence has been committed, the person who is guilty
may be arrested;
(d) where the arrestable offence has been committed, the person is reasonably
suspected of having committed the offence;
(e) where a constable reasonably believes that an arrestable offence has been
committed, any person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting tobe guilty of the offence may be arrested;
(f) any person is about to commit an arrestable offence may be arrested;(g) any person whom the police officer reasonably believes is about to commit
an arrestable offence.
136
Arrestable offences
Section 24 applies:
(a) to offences for which the sentence is fixed by law;
(b) to offences for which a person of over 21 years of age or over (not
previously convicted) may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five
years (or might be so sentenced but for the restrictions imposed by section33 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980); and
(c) to the offences to which section 24(2) applies and in this Act ‘arrestable
offence’ means any such offence.
Offences for which a person may be arrested under section 24 may also be
classified as ‘serious arrestable offences’ under section 116 and Schedule 5,Part I of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
137Where that is the case, the
power of arrest is unaffected, but the safeguards and powers exercisableunder detention conditions are affected. Helen Fenwick analyses theimportance of the distinction between the two categories as follows:
731136 PACE 1984, s 24(4), (5), (6), (7). The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, s 50, provides
for the arrest without warrant of a person reasonably suspected of have broken or being
likely to break any bail condition.
137 Offences include treason, murder, manslaughter, rape, kidnapping, incest with a girl
under the age of 13, buggery with a boy under the age of 16 or a person who has notconsented, and an indecent assault which constitutes an act of gross indecency. TheCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, s 85, extends the list to include an offenceunder the Protection of Children Act 1978, s 1 (indecent photographs and pseudo-photographs of children) and an offence under the Obscene Publications Act 1959, s 2(publication of obscene matter).

The section 24 offences which may also fall into this category fall into two
groups as defined under section 116 – first, those which are so serious (such asmurder, manslaughter, and indecent assault which amounts to grossindecency) that they will always be serious arrestable offences and secondly,those which will be so classified only if their commission has led to certainspecified consequences, namely, serious harm to the security of the state orpublic order, serious interference with the administration of justice orinvestigation of offences, death or serious injury, substantial financial gain orserious financial loss.
138
An arrestable offence is a serious offence which carries a sentence fixed by
law. Conspiracy to commit such offences, or attempts or incitement, aiding,abetting, counselling or procuring such offences are all arrestable offences.
139
Where an arrestable offence has occurred, or the police reasonably suspectsomeone is committing such an offence, or about to commit such an offence,the police may arrest without a warrant.
140In these circumstances, there is no
need for the police to establish the ‘general arrest conditions’ which apply toarrest for less serious offences. 
The police may arrest without warrant for any non-arrestable offence –
that is to say, less serious offences – where the ‘general arrest conditions’ aresatisfied.
141The ‘general arrest conditions’ are:
(a) that the name of the relevant person is unknown, and cannot be readily
ascertained by, the constable;
(b) that the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name
furnished by the relevant person as his name is his real name;
(c) that:
(i) the relevant person has failed to furnish a satisfactory address for
service; or
(ii) the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether an address
furnished by the relevant person is a satisfactory address for service;
(d) that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is
necessary to prevent the relevant person:
(i) causing physical injury to himself or any other person;(ii) suffering physical injury;
(iii) causing loss of or damage to property;
(iv) committing an offence against public decency; or(v) causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway;
(e) that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is
necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the relevant
person.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Giving reasons for the arrest
A failure to give reasons for an arrest will cause the arrest to be unlawful. In
Christie v Leachinsky (1947) ,the House of Lords ruled that a person must be
told of the fact of his or her arrest and the grounds for arrest, although thisneed not be done if the circumstances are obvious or it is difficult tocommunicate with the arrested person. Section 28 of the Police and CriminalEvidence Act 1984 places the requirements on a statutory basis and makesthem more stringent. Subject to a person escaping before the information canbe communicated, section 28 requires that:
(a) the person making the arrest must inform the arrested person of the fact of,
and reasons for, arrest, either immediately or as soon as is reasonably
practicable afterwards;143
(b) a police officer making an arrest must inform the person arrested of these
matters even if they are obvious.144
No particular form of words need be used, but they must be in sufficient
detail to enable the arrested person to understand the issue and, if possible, todeny the allegation and be released. Where it is not possible to state reasonsimmediately, for example, because the arrestee is reacting violently, reasonsmust be stated as soon as practicable. This requirement is illustrated inDirector of Public Prosecutions v Hawkins (1988). In that case, a violent struggle
prevented reasons being given immediately. However, when the arrestee wassubdued, reasons for the arrest were still not given. The arrest becameunlawful when the opportunity to give reasons arose, and reasons were notgiven. A sympathetic attitude to the arresting authorities was seen in Lewis v
Chief Constable of the South Wales Constabulary (1991). There, two people were
arrested and not immediately informed of the reasons for arrest. In an actionfor false imprisonment, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the circuitjudge, that the arrests were unlawful until the reasons were given but, oncethe reasons were given, the arrests became lawful. However, in Ghagar v Chief
Constable of West Midlands Police (2000), the Court of Appeal took a strict view
in relation to a motoring offence, stating that a police officer must state boththe offence which a person is suspected of committing and the power torequest a name and address.
The giving of reasons for arrest is also a requirement under the European
Convention on Human Rights. In Fox, Campbell and Hartley v United Kingdom
(1990) , the applicants were arrested on suspected terrorist offences, but were
not informed of the reason for the arrest, although they were told they werebeing arrested under a specified statutory provision. When later interviewed,they were asked about specific criminal offences. The Court of Human Rightsheld that paragraph 5(2) of Article 5 had not been satisfied at the time of the
733143 PACE 1984, s 28(1), (3).
144Ibid, s 28(2), (3).

arrest, but that the defect was later rectified. The case of Murray, discussed
above, also went to the European Court. The Court again found no breach of
Article 5. Although she was denied reasons for some half an hour, she waseventually informed of the reason for arrest during interrogation.
Detention following arrest
Once a person has been arrested, he or she may be detained by the police forquestioning before a charge is laid. There exists a fine balance to be achievedhere between permitting the police to question a suspect in order to determinewhether there exist sufficient grounds on which to make a charge, and theneed to protect persons from unwarranted detention by the police. Section41(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides that a personshall not be kept in police detention for more than 24 hours without beingcharged. The time runs from the time of the person’s arrest or, in the case of aperson’s arrest outside the relevant police area, from the time at which hearrives in the police station.
145
The 24 hour period is extendable. The grounds on which detention beyond
24 hours may be authorised are as follows. For authorisation by a seniorofficer of police, there must be reasonable grounds for believing that thedetention is necessary in order to secure or preserve evidence or obtainevidence by questioning; that the offence in question is a ‘serious arrestableoffence’; and that the police investigation is being conducted ‘diligently andexpeditiously’.
146A review of detention must be made after 24 hours.147On
application to the senior officer, authorisation may be given to detain him forup to 36 hours.
148After 36 hours of detention, a person must be brought
before the magistrates’ court for a hearing. The authorised period of furtherdetention is at the magistrates’ discretion, but shall not be longer than 36hours,
149but the police may apply for a further period of detention which, if
granted, may extend the period of detention to a possible maximum of 96hours.
150
Bail
Section 41(7) provides that, if a person has not been charged at the expiry of 24hours, he shall, subject to sub-section 8, be released, either on bail or withoutbail.
151The 24 hour time limit does not apply to persons whose detention forChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

more than 24 hours has been authorised by a senior officer152or where a
successful application has been made to a magistrates’ court by the police for
continued detention.153
Conditions of detention
The Codes of Practice detail the conditions under which persons may be held.These include no more than one person in a cell, access to toilet and washingfacilities, the provision of adequate food and daily exercise. The police maynot use more than ‘reasonable force’ in relation to detainees in preventingescape, or causing damage to property. Appropriate medical treatment mustbe given where necessary. 
In R v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1999), the House of Lords
ruled that authorities, such as the police or prison service, who were entrustedwith holding prisoners in custody, had a duty to take reasonable care toprevent them from harming themselves or committing suicide. Where therewas a breach of that duty and a suicide occurred, the authorities were notentitled to rely on the defences of volenti non fit injuria or novus actus
interveniens in an action for negligence brought by the estate of the
deceased.
154
The right to legal advice155
Under section 58(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, ‘a personarrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises shall beentitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor privately at any time’.
Delay in complying with a request to consult a lawyer is only permitted
where the person is being held in connection with a serious arrestable offenceand where a senior officer has authorised the delay. The grounds on whichdelay may be authorised include reasonable grounds for believing that therewill be interference with or harm to evidence; that exercising the right wouldlead to alerting other suspects who have not yet been arrested; or thatexercising the right would hinder the recovery of any property obtained as aresult of the offence.
156
Legal representation may be crucial to the protection of the suspect from
oppressive questioning by the police. Where confessions are obtained byoppression, a guilty verdict may subsequently be set aside.

The guidelines for intervening in questioning include, inter alia, the following:
... you may need to intervene if the questions are: ... oppressive, threatening or
insulting;... you should intervene if the officer is not asking questions but only makinghis/her own comments ...... if questions are improper or improperly put, you should intervene and beprepared to explain your objections ...... if improprieties remain uncorrected or continue, advise the suspect ofhis/her right to remain silent.
158
When a person has been arrested and is being held in custody at a police
station, he or she has the right to communicate with one other person ‘as soonas practicable’.
159A delay is only permitted, where an officer of the rank of
superintendent authorises it, on the basis that ‘he has reasonable grounds tobelieve’ that the communication will lead to interference with evidenceconnected with a serious arrestable offence, or physical injury to otherpersons, or will lead to alerting of other suspects connected with the offence,and will hinder the recovery of property obtained as a result of the offence.
160
Section 58(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 also provides that aperson who is in police detention ‘shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consulta solicitor privately at any time’. In addition, section 59 inserts into the LegalAid Act 1982 a provision which is capable of preventing a solicitor fromproviding advice and legal representation under the Legal Aid scheme if ‘theydo not also provide advice and assistance ... for persons ... held in custody’.Under Code of Practice C,
161a detainee is to be informed of the right to legal
advice,162and given the name of a duty solicitor if he or she requires it.163The
detainee is also entitled to have a solicitor present during questioning.164
However, where a person is arrested for a serious arrestable offence, and anofficer of the rank of superintendent or above so authorises, access to asolicitor may be delayed for up to 36 hours. Such a delay may be authorisedwhere the officer is concerned that there is a risk to witnesses or to evidencerelating to the case, or where immediate access would hinder the recovery ofany property obtained as a result of the offence.
165In cases of suspected
terrorism, the right to consult a solicitor is conditioned by the requirementthat the interview is conducted within ‘the sight and hearing’ of a uniformedofficer.

Samuel (1988), it was held that delay in access to legal advice can only be
justified on specific grounds which must be substantiated to the satisfaction of
the court.
The right to have a solicitor attend during police interviews has been held
not to apply to a suspect arrested in Northern Ireland under section 14 of thePrevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, since section 58 ofthe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was not applicable to a personarrested or detained under the terrorism provisions.
167The House of Lords so
held in R v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ex parte Begley (1997).
The right to legal advice must also be considered in relation to Article 6 of
the European Convention on Human Rights. See, inter alia, the discussion of
Magee v United Kingdom (2001), Condron v United Kingdom (2001) and Murray v
United Kingdom (1996) in Chapter 19.
The right to inform someone of arrest and detention
A person held in a police station is entitled to inform a relative or friend ‘orother person concerned with his welfare’ of his arrest without delay, unlesssuch notification would prejudice the investigation of crime or the arrest ofother suspects.
168
The right to silence169
In relation to the right to silence, the position of a person who has beenarrested is different from that of a citizen before arrest, and the CriminalJustice and Public Order Act 1994 made substantial amendments to this right.See, further, below.
The reforms introduced under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
are amongst the most controversial reforms of the protection of an accused formany years. Those who oppose a weakening of the right to silence base theirarguments on the relative vulnerability of the accused, and the need to protectthe accused from making statements which might falsely incriminate him.
170
Against this concern must be set the argument that when individuals arepermitted to remain silent when questioned by the police, advantage of thisright is taken by ‘professional criminals’ who are familiar with the process.The concern has been that such persons will conceal information underquestioning and then ‘ambush’ the prosecution by revealing the informationin court.
171
737167 Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order, SI 1989/1341, Article 59(2).
168 PACE 1984, s 56.169 See McConville and Hodgson, 1993.170 The reform was opposed by, inter alia , the Law Society, the Bar Council and the
Magistrates’ Association. On the other side, those in favour included the Police Service,
the Crown Prosecution Service, HM Council of Circuit Judges and many senior judges.
171 See R v Zuckerman (1989).

Sections 34 to 38 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 effect
the reforms. Under section 34, where an accused is being questioned under
caution and fails to mention any fact later relied on in his evidence or, wherethe accused has been officially charged with an offence
172or officially
informed that he might be prosecuted for it,173he fails to mention any fact
which in the circumstances existing at the time ‘the accused could reasonablyhave been expected to mention’ when questioned, charged or informed, thenthe court, in determining whether there is a case to answer,
174and the court of
jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged,175
may ‘draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper’.
Section 35 relates to the accused’s silence at trial. Other than where a
person’s guilt is not in issue, or where the court considers that the physical ormental condition of the accused ‘makes it undesirable for him to giveevidence’, the court must satisfy itself that the accused is aware that the stagehas been reached where he or she can give evidence in defence. If the accusedthen chooses not to give evidence, or without good cause refuses to answerquestions, it is permissible for the court or jury to draw such inferences ‘asappear proper from his failure to give evidence or his refusal, without goodcause, to answer any question’.
176Section 35 relates to persons who have
attained the age of 14 years177and, where the age of the person is ‘material’,
his age ‘shall for those purposes be taken to be that which appears to the courtto be his age’.
178
Section 36 relates to the effect of an accused’s failure to account for objects,
substances or marks. Where a person has been arrested by a constable, and thepolice reasonably believe that the presence of the object, substance or markmay be attributable to the accused participating in the commission of aspecific offence, the police are entitled to ask for an explanation as to theobject, etc.
179If the person fails to account for it, then the court, when
(a) considering whether to dismiss the charge, or (b) deciding whether there isa case to answer, or (c) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, isentitled to ‘draw such inferences from the failure or refusal as appearproper’.
180
Section 37 relates to the accused’s failure to account for his or her presence
at a particular place. If a person arrested by a constable was found at a placewhere the offence was committed, and the officer reasonably believes that hisChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law

presence was attributable to participation in the offence, and the constable
requests him to account for his presence, then, if that person fails to do so, acourt, or court or jury, in circumstances (a), (b) and (c) in relation to section 36,may draw ‘such inferences from the failure or refusal as appear proper’.
181
In R v Argent (1997), the Court of Appeal ruled that six formal conditions
had to be met before the jury could draw adverse inferences under section 34of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The accused had beenconvicted for manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Thedefendant appealed against conviction. The Lord Chief Justice stated that theformal conditions to be met were:
(1) there had to be proceedings against a person for an offence. That condition
had necessarily to be satisfied before section 34 could bite;
(2) the alleged failure had to occur before a defendant was charged;
(3) the alleged failure had to occur during questioning under caution by aconstable, or any other person within section 34(4);
(4) the questioning had to be directed to trying to discover whether or bywhom the alleged offence had been committed;
(5) the alleged failure by the defendant had to be to mention any fact relied on
in his defence to those proceedings. That raised two questions of fact:(a) was there some fact which the defendant had relied on in his defence?;(b) did the defendant, when he was being questioned in accordance withsection 34, fail to mention it?;
(6) the fact that the appellant failed to mention was a fact which, in the
circumstances existing at the time, he could reasonably have been expectedto mention when so questioned.
The relevant time was the time of questioning and account had to be taken ofall the relevant circumstances existing at that time.The court should not construe the expression ‘in the circumstances’restrictively; matters such as time of day, the defendant’s age, experience,mental capacity, state of health, sobriety, tiredness, personality and legaladvice were all part of the relevant circumstances. Those were only examplesof the things which might be relevant.
182
The ‘right to silence’ and serious fraud trials
Different provisions apply to serious fraud trials. Under the Criminal Justice
Act 1987, where the Serious Fraud Office issues a ‘section 2 notice’, the personto whom the notice is addressed commits a criminal offence if he or she doesnot attend for interview and answer questions. In addition, under section432(2) of the Companies Act 1985, where a company is under investigation, aperson is under a legal obligation to answer questions.

(1997), the Court of Human Rights ruled that the provisions were in violation
of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.184
The reliability of evidence185
It is central to the protection of the individual that evidence be obtained in alawful manner. The question arises as to how the law can secure a balancebetween ensuring that the police operate within the law, and the Codes ofPractice which supplement the law, and allowing evidence to be used whichmay have been obtained in a manner not strictly in accordance with the rulesbut which does prove that a suspect committed a particular crime. If evidenceis made inadmissible, on the basis of a procedural irregularity, a guilty suspectmay go free. On the other hand, if the evidence – however obtained – isadmitted, and proves false, there is a danger of innocent suspects beingwrongfully convicted.
Prior to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the admissibility of
evidence was regulated under the common law. A distinction was drawnbetween illegally obtained evidence which was admissible, and involuntaryconfessions which were inadmissible on the basis that they might beunreliable.
186The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 places the
admissibility of evidence on a statutory basis. In relation to confessions, thereare four criteria to be employed in determining whether they should beadmissible in court. Section 76 regulates confessions.
187Confessions are
admissible into court unless the confession has been obtained by(a) oppression,
188or (b) in consequence of anything said or done which was
likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable anyconfession which might be made by him in consequence thereof.
189In those
circumstances, the court ‘shall not allow the confession to be given in evidenceagainst him except in so far as the prosecution proves to the court beyondreasonable doubt that the confession (notwithstanding that it may be true)was not obtained as aforesaid’.
190Moreover, in any case where the
prosecution proposes to give in evidence a confession, the court may, of itsown motion, require the prosecution to prove that the confession has not beenChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
740184 See, also, IJL, CMR and AKP v United Kingdom (2000) and, further, Chapter 19.
185 The law of evidence is complex and outside the scope of this chapter other than by way
of introduction. See, generally, Tapper, 1995; Fenwick, 2001, Chapter 14, pp 868–98. On
the balance between controlling police powers and admitting evidence, see Ashworth,1963a and 1963b; Birch, 1989, 1994.
186 See R v Isequilla (1975); R v Ping Lin (1976); R v Sang (1980).
187 Confessions are defined to include ‘any statement wholly or partly adverse to the
person who made it, whether made to a person in authority or not and whether madein words or otherwise’: PACE 1984, s 82.
188 ‘Oppression’ is defined to include torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the use
or threat of violence (whether or not amounting to torture): PACE 1984, s 76(8).
189 PACE 1984, s 76(1)(a), (b).
190Ibid, s 76(2).

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
obtained in the circumstances above.191However, where a confession has
been partly or wholly excluded on the grounds above, that fact does not affect
the admissibility in evidence (a) of any facts discovered as a result of theconfession, or (b) where the confession is relevant as showing that the accusedspeaks, writes or expresses himself in a particular way, of so much of theconfession as is necessary to show that he does so.
192
In relation to the exclusion of ‘unfair evidence’, section 78 of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides that:
In any proceedings, the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the
prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, havingregard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which theevidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such anadverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not toadmit it.
193
Section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 is far wider than
section 76, and may be relevant to confessions obtained which do not fallwithin the requirements of section 76.
194Thus, for example, if a confession is
fabricated, the defence will argue that the accused did not make a confessionand, accordingly, that ‘confession’ could not fall under section 76. The powerto refuse to allow evidence is discretionary. Where there has been a breach ofthe rules under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, and that breach issubstantiated to the satisfaction of the court, the question to be determined iswhether the breach is substantial or significant,
195other than where the police
had acted in bad faith.196Having established whether a breach of the rules is
substantial or significant, the court will then look to the nature of the rule inquestion in relation to the circumstances of the case. Thus, for example, theright to have a legal adviser present will be deemed the more important inrelation to a vulnerable suspect who could be easily confused by policequestioning.
Habeas corpus
The ancient writ of habeas corpus is available to test the legality of a person’sdetention. The writ can be issued either by the person imprisoned or bysomeone acting on his behalf. If it is established that there is a prima facie
ground for believing the detention to be unlawful, the writ will be issued.
741191 PACE 1984, s 76(3).
192Ibid, s 76(4).
193Ibid, s 82(3), preserves the common law power to exclude evidence at the court’s
discretion.
194R v Mason (1987). See R v Khan (1997); and Khan v UK , discussed in Chapter 19. See, also,
R v Chalkley (1998).
195R v Keenan (1989).
196R v Walsh (1989).

Originally a common law power, the right to a writ was placed on a statutory
basis under the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. The Act of 1679 relates to personsimprisoned on a criminal charge. The Habeas Corpus Act 1816 relates topersons detained other than on a criminal charge.
197AV Dicey instructed that:
... if, in short, any man, woman, or child is deprived of liberty, the court will
always issue a writ of habeas corpus to any one who has the aggrieved personin his custody to have such person brought before the court, and if he issuffering restraint without lawful cause, set him free.
198
In the case of Wolfe Tone (1798), Tone was tried and found guilty of high
treason by a court-martial and sentenced to death. A writ was issued on the
basis that, since Wolfe Tone was not under commission to the English army,but rather held a commission from the French Republic, there was nojurisdiction for his trial by court-martial in Ireland. The Lord Chief Justiceinstructed the sheriff to go immediately to the army barracks and demand thatTone not be executed. When the officers refused to comply with the order, theLord Chief Justice ordered that Tone, and the detaining officers, be taken intothe custody of the sheriff. On seeking to recover Tone from detention, it wasfound that he had cut his throat and could not be moved. On this case, Diceywrote, seemingly without irony, that ‘it will be admitted that no moresplendid assertion of the supremacy of law can be found than the protectionof Wolfe Tone by the Irish Bench’.
199
The writ has also been used to test the legality of detention of slaves:
Sommersett’s Case (1771) and of students: Ex parte Daisy Hopkins (1891). In Board
of Control ex parte Rutty (1956), a writ was issued to test the legality of the
detention of a mentally defective patient who had been detained for eightyears without an order of a court. Nowadays, the writ of habeas corpus ismost often used to test the legality of the detention of immigrants. However,in R v Home Secretary ex parte Mughal (1974) and R v Home Secretary ex parte
Zamir (1980), the court refused to allow habeas corpus to be used to question
the decision to remove an illegal immigrant from the country. Conversely, inR v Home Secretary ex parte Khawaja (1984), the House of Lords ruled that the
question as to whether a person was an illegal immigrant was not within theexclusive jurisdiction of the Home Secretary to decide. Rather it was a matterof fact, which the courts would decide. Before Khawaja could be removedfrom the country, the court had to be satisfied on the evidence that he was infact an illegal immigrant. Only if he was an illegal immigrant would the courtpermit deportation. 
There exists an overlap between habeas corpus and judicial review which
causes uncertainty: see Chapters 24 and 25. In R v Home Secretary ex parteChapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
742197 The Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prohibits the courts from issuing writs in respect of
colonies or dominions where those jurisdictions have power to issue the writ.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Cheblak (1991),the Court of Appeal held that habeas corpus is not a substitute
for judicial review proceedings. However, where an application for judicial
review is pending, a writ may be used to ensure that the applicant is notprematurely removed from the country.
200
PROTECTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY
In Semayne’s Case (1605), the principle was judicially declared that an
‘Englishman’s home is his castle’. Two early cases reveal judicial boldness inthe protection from unlawful entry into property. In Wilkes v Wood (1763), an
Under Secretary of State, accompanied by police, entered into Wilkes’s home,broke open his desk and seized papers. In an action for trespass against theUnder Secretary, Lord Pratt CJ stated that the power claimed would affect ‘theperson and property of every man in this kingdom, and is totally subversiveof the liberty of the subject’. Moreover, such action, being without justificationand unlawful, was ‘contrary to the fundamental principles of the constitution’.
In the seminal case of Entick v Carrington (1765) ,the Secretary of State,
under a general warrant, authorised the entry into property and the seizure of
property of Entick, suspected of publishing seditious literature. In an actionfor trespass against Carrington, Lord Camden CJ declared:
This power, so claimed by the Secretary of State, is not supported by a single
citation from any law book extant ...If it is law, it will be found in our books. If it is not to be found there, it is notlaw.By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever sominute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my ground without mylicence, but he is liable to an action, though the damages be nothing ... 
Every entry into the property of the citizen must be authorised by law.
However, such freedom from arbitrary intrusion is – in the absence of awritten guarantee of rights – subject always to the sovereignty of parliament.It may also be that the royal prerogative will confer legitimacy on what mightotherwise be deemed an invasion of property. The doctrine that ‘a man’shome is his castle’
201has many exceptions. As seen in Chapter 6, statutory
rights of entry are conferred on employees of public authorities.
In addition to rights of physical entry into property, the issue of warrants
to intercept communications202authorises a non-physical but nevertheless
real intrusion into a person’s private property.

Rights of entry under common law 
The courts have considered rights of entry under common law. In Thomas v
Sawkins (1935), it was held that the police are entitled to be present at a public
meeting on private premises even where organisers asked them to leave. The
officers had reasonably believed that a breach of the peace would occur and,hence, were justified in remaining and were not trespassing.
203In R v Inland
Revenue Commissioners ex parte Rossminster Ltd (1980) ,however, the House of
Lords ruled that clear wording in a statute would override the individual’sright to privacy in the home.
Police powers of entry came into conflict with Article 8 of the European
Convention in McLeod v United Kingdom (1998). The applicant was required by
a court order to surrender certain items to her former husband. The formerhusband entered the premises, with members of his family and a solicitor’sclerk, with the permission of the applicant’s mother, but in the applicant’sabsence. The police had been called because of fears of a breach of the peaceand entered the premises and checked the list of items to be removed.Following the applicant’s return, the police insisted that the husband leavewith the property. The applicant’s action against the police was dismissed bythe Court of Appeal. The Court of Human Rights ruled that although thepolice’s action was lawful and had the legitimate aim of preventing a breachof the peace, their entry in the applicant’s absence and their failure to checkthe terms of the court order rendered their conduct disproportionate and inviolation of the right to privacy.
Police powers of entry, search and seizure
The police have special powers of entry and search, recognised undercommon law, but now clarified under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act1984. For the most part, entry is authorised under a warrant authorised by amagistrate.
204Over and above entry under warrant, however, there exists a
class of cases under which the police may enter without warrant undersections 17 and 18 of the Act. Included in this class, are entry to arrest for anarrestable offence or for offences under the Public Order Act 1936, or CriminalLaw Act 1977. Entry without warrant is also lawful if exercised to recover aprison, court or mental hospital detainee and to save life or prevent seriousdamage to property. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 permits thedetention of a vehicle, small ship and small aircraft (each of which is definedin the Act), until all charges for carrying clandestine entrants have beenpaid.

204 PACE 1984, s 8.
205 See, further, Chapters 19 and 22.

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Under sections 18 and 19 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the
police have the power to seize and retain a vehicle and not just parts of it or its
contents, although those sections relate to ‘premises’. The Court of Appeal soheld in Cowan v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (2000), in which the
court also ruled that a vehicle was ‘premises’ for the purpose of the Act andthe Act did not give power to seize premises but only contents, that ruleapplied where the premises were immoveable and could not physically beremoved. Where premises were moveable there was no reason not to interpret‘anything’ in sections 18 and 19 as including ‘everything’. When exercising asearch warrant under section 8(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act1984, however, a police officer was not entitled to remove items from thepremises in order to sift through them for the purpose of deciding whetherthey fell within the scope of the warrant.
206In Webb v Chief Constable of
Merseyside Police (2000), the Court of Appeal ruled that there was no statutory
power for the police to retain money seized by the police in the investigationof drug trafficking, where the person entitled to possession of the money wasnot convicted of a drug trafficking offence, and there was no general power toretain the money on public interest grounds. It might be lawful for the policeto retain goods of a kind that it was unlawful to deal in them at all, but moneywas not of this character. 
Where police exercise statutory powers of entry by the use of reasonable
force, unless circumstances make it impossible, impracticable or undesirable,the police should give any occupant present the reason for his seeking toexercise that power of entry. The police had entered premises under section 17of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, for the purpose of arrest. InO’Loughlin v Chief Constable of Essex (1998),the Court of Appeal,  dismissing an
appeal by the Chief Constable of Essex against an order of the county court,granted damages and costs to the defendant for, inter alia ,assault by the
defendant’s officers. 
Under section 32 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, where a
person is arrested at a place other than a police station, a police constable maysearch the arrested person for anything which might assist him to escape fromlawful custody or for anything which might be evidence relating to an offence,and to enter and search any premises in which he was when arrested orimmediately before he was arrested for evidence relating to the offence forwhich he has been arrested.
207The power is subject to the requirement that
the ‘constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested personmay present a danger to himself or others’.
208The power to search is limited
to what is ‘reasonably required’ for the purpose of discovery.209Search of the
745206R v Chesterfield Justices and Others ex parte Bramley (1999).
207 PACE 1984, s 32(2).

209Ibid, s 32(3).

person is restricted: a person may not be required to remove any of his or her
clothing in public, other than an outer coat, jacket or gloves, and the searchmay only be conducted if the constable ‘has reasonable grounds for believing’that the person concerned has concealed on his or her person anything forwhich a search is permitted.
210If the permitted search discloses anything
which might be used to cause physical injury to the person or any otherperson, the officer may seize and retain anything found, other than an itemsubject to legal privilege, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that theitem may be used to assist escape from lawful custody, or is evidence of anoffence, or has been obtained in consequence of the commission of anoffence.
211
Searching a suspect’s property
At common law, the legality of searches of a person’s property was doubtful.In Ghani v Jones (1969), police officers investigating a woman’s disappearance
searched, without a warrant, her father-in-law’s house. At the request of thepolice, passports and documents were handed over. When the return of thepassports was requested, the police refused. The court ruled that where noone had been arrested, the police were justified in taking an article if, first,‘there were reasonable grounds for believing that a serious offence had beencommitted’; secondly, that there were reasonable grounds ‘for believing thatthe article in question is either a fruit of the crime ... or is the instruments bywhich the crime was committed ... or is material evidence to prove thecommission of the crime’; thirdly, the police must reasonably believe that theperson in possession of the article has ‘himself committed the crime, or isimplicated in it, or is accessory to it, or at any rate his refusal must be quiteunreasonable’; fourthly, the police must not keep the article longer thanreasonably necessary; and finally, the ‘lawfulness of the conduct of the policemust be judged at the time, and not by what happens afterwards’. Thisdecision tipped the balance very much in favour of the powers of the police, tothe detriment of individual citizens. However, in Jeffrey v Black (1978), where
the defendant was arrested for allegedly stealing a sandwich, and the policesubsequently searched his home and found drugs, the court ruled that,whereas the search might have been lawful if the police were looking forevidence connected with the theft, it was unlawful to search for evidence ofanother offence. In McLorie v Oxford (1982) ,the court disapproved of lenient
attitudes to police searches. Lord Justice Donaldson confirmed that there wasno common law right to enter into a dwelling house to search for ‘theinstruments of crime, even of serious crime’.Chapter 21: Constitutional & Administrative Law
746210 PACE 1984, s 32(4), (5).
211Ibid, s 32(8), (9).

Freedom of Association and Assembly, Public Order and Police Powers
Police powers to enter into property other than after arrest
At common law, the police have no right to enter into private property
without a warrant. Accordingly, if they so enter and are asked to leave – evenwhere reasonable force is used to evict them – the police are not acting in theexecution of their duty and an individual cannot be convicted for assaulting apolice officer executing his duty.
212There are a number of conditions under
which a police officer might enter property, each of which is founded on thebasis of a ‘lawful excuse’. In the absence of a lawful excuse for entry, the policecommitted a trespass. At common law, entry was lawful to prevent a breachof the peace,
213or in the case of actions designed to save life or prevent injury.
Under the Criminal Law Act 1967, there was statutory power to enterpremises in order to execute an arrest. 
In Khazanchi v Faircharm Investments Ltd ; McLeod v Butterwick (1998), the
Court of Appeal held that the police have no right to forcibly enter propertyfor lawful purposes, even where the owner had previously consented to theirentry, when the owner, not aware of the police’s intention to visit at aparticular time, locked his house on leaving.
The right to search premises under the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984
Under section 18, a police officer may enter premises of a person arrested for
an arrestable offence and search for evidence of the offence for which he hasbeen arrested or for related offences. There must be reasonable grounds forbelieving that the evidence is on the premises. Authorisation for the searchmust be given by a senior officer, and a written record of the grounds for thesearch and the evidence sought made.

214 Special powers also arise under the Terrorism Acts: see Chapter 23. Problems arise with
the search of prisoners’ property when the claim to legal privilege arises: see R (Daly) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001), in which the House of Lords ruled that
prison officers could not exclude prisoners from their cells in order to effect a search.

which the notice relates.216As an alternative, the person concerned may
choose to be tried for the offences.
Problems are encountered by the police in the seizure of materials which
might be legally privileged, being correspondence between a client and his or
her lawyer. Where the police seize such material and the owner claims that itis privileged, the position of the police has proved uncertain.
217In order to
remedy the difficulties, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 providesstatutory authority for the removal of property for examination elsewhere andauthorises the removal of material which is intrinsically related (such ascomputer disks), where it is not reasonably practicable for the property to beseparated from that which it would otherwise be unlawful to remove.

Where property is found to be privileged, that property must be returned assoon as is practicable.

CHAPTER 22
INTRODUCTION
The concept of citizenship is fundamental to the question of rights of
residence and freedom of movement of the individual. Historically, atcommon law, any individual lawfully within the realm owed a duty ofallegiance to the Crown, in return for which the Crown owed a duty ofprotection to the individual.
2This reciprocal relationship, in the eighteenth
century, came to be dubbed the social contract under which citizens concededpower to government to rule, the government holding its powers as a trusteeof the individual’s rights and freedoms.
3The Crown had the right to control
rights of entry to the country, and the duty to protect the country’s borders.4
Being an island, from a historical point of view, the task of controlling theexternal boundaries of the state was a relatively easy matter. 
Magna Carta of 1215 recognised the right of merchants, other than those
from enemy countries in time of war, to enter, leave, stay and travel inEngland. The Magna Carta also expressed the right of other individuals whoowed allegiance to the King, to enter, leave and re-enter the realm.
5In times of
emergency, the King could prevent persons from leaving the realm.6Classes
of persons could be denied entry and those already present ordered to leavethe land, where their remaining constituted a perceived threat to the ‘publicgood’. In 1530, for example, a statute
7provided that Gypsies could no longer
enter the country and, in 1547, statute provided that Gypsies over the age of14 born in England had one month in which to leave the realm.
8In the
Victorian era, immigration was legally uncontrolled. From the 1880s, large

aliens: Chapter 42. The right to leave one’s country is an international law right under
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 12(2), which providesthat ‘everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own’. The making ofexclusion orders against suspected terrorists under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts,which confines that person to his own country, violates that international law right. See,further, Chapter 23.

numbers of East European Jews fleeing from persecution entered the country,
and a political campaign for restrictions to be introduced resulted in theenactment of the Aliens Act 1905. Not all aliens were barred, and controlswere aimed at those arriving at certain ports and travelling on the cheapestclass of ticket. The Act also introduced power to curb the entry of certaingroups – powers which were on one occasion used to restrict entry of Chineseand Gypsy people. The aliens inspectorate was the forerunner to theimmigration service, and came under the control of the Home Office. The FirstWorld War marked a tightening of immigration control under the AliensRestriction Act 1914 and the Defence of the Realm Acts. From 1919, all alienswere subject to controls on entry. The Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act1919 confirmed the restrictions and remained in force until 1973.
With the expansion of the British Empire, the status of British subject was
conferred on all citizens within the Empire. With the growth in independenceof formerly dependent territories, the newly independent States exerted theirown right to control nationality and immigration. In 1948, the BritishNationality Act created a new classification – that of citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies. All such citizens, and citizens of otherCommonwealth nations, became British subjects or Commonwealth citizens,and enjoyed the same rights of entry and residence into the United Kingdom.These extensive rights to enter and reside were, by the 1960s, put under greatstrain as increasing numbers of overseas subjects sought to enter and reside inthe United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Immigration Acts of 1962 and 1968imposed restrictions on entry. Discrimination entered into the law.
9Under the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, controls were introduced whichdistinguished between the rights of entry of citizens from Commonwealthcountries who had familial and ancestral links with the United Kingdom andthose who did not. The 1968 Act
10further tightened rights of immigration,
limiting the rights of entry of those who had no parental or grandparentallinks with the United Kingdom. The Immigration Act 1971 furtherdistinguished between subjects who were free to enter the United Kingdomand those who needed permission to enter. The 1971 Act, which came intoforce on 1 January 1973, also provided the criteria for rights of residence in theUnited Kingdom. Under the Act, the distinction between aliens andCommonwealth citizens was reduced, and the important distinction becamebetween those with rights of abode in the United Kingdom and others,whether aliens or Commonwealth immigrants, who were subject toimmigration control and required permission to enter and remain. Also in1973, the United Kingdom became a member of the European Communities,now the European Community and Union, and distinctions arose between theChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law
7509 See Martin, ‘Racism in immigration law and practice’, in Wallington, 1984, pp 245–57.
10 The Act was regarded as racially discriminatory by the European Commission on
Human Rights: the East African Asian cases (1973). See, further, Chapter 19.

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
rights of citizens of Member States of the Community and citizens from non-
EC countries. Section 1 of the Act lays down general principles. Section 1(1) ofthe Immigration Act 1971 provides that:
All those who are in this Act expressed to have the right of abode in the United
Kingdom shall be free to live in, and to come and go into and from, the UnitedKingdom without let or hindrance except such as may be required under andin accordance with this Act to enable their right to be established or as may beotherwise lawfully imposed on any person.
Section 2 of the 1971 Act stipulates who has the right of abode. A person has a
right of abode in the United Kingdom if (a) he is a British citizen; or (b) he is aCommonwealth citizen who (i) immediately before the commencement of theBritish Nationality Act 1981 was a Commonwealth citizen having the right ofabode in the United Kingdom by virtue of section 2(1)(d) or section 2(2) of thisAct as then in force, and (ii) has not ceased to be a Commonwealth citizen inthe meanwhile. 
The 1971 Act also created the status of patriality and non-patriality – non-
patrials having lesser rights of entry than patrials. The classification schemewas complex and much criticised. One consequence of the concept was thatsome Commonwealth and United Kingdom citizens were not conferred aright of entry by virtue of patriality, notwithstanding that they had no othercountry to go to. In particular, in relation to East African Asians, the rulesworked harshly, and resulted in condemnation by the Court of Human Rightson the basis that it represented degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 ofthe European Convention on Human Rights.
11
The need to bring the law relating to nationality and immigration law into
conformity led to the Immigration Act 1971. Immigration law wassubstantially reformed by the British Nationality Act 1981, with a tighteningof the rules on rights of appeal against deportation orders and making it acriminal offence to overstay leave to enter.
12It is also from the Immigration
Act 1971 that current citizenship status flows. The Act replaced the formercategories of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies with threeclasses of persons: British citizenship, British Dependent Territoriescitizenship and British Overseas citizenship. In addition to these categories,there exists the status of British National (Overseas) citizens, Commonwealthcitizens, and citizens of the European Union.
75111 The East African Asian cases (1973). The matter was referred to the Committee of
Ministers which failed to reach a decision by the required two-thirds majority.
12 The problems caused by refugees seeking to enter and remain in the United Kingdom
led to further reforms under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 and the
Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, both of which have, in turn, been substantiallyreformed by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

BRITISH CITIZENSHIP
British citizenship may be acquired by birth, adoption, descent, registration or
naturalisation.
Birth
A legitimate child born in the United Kingdom, one of whose parents is aBritish citizen or is ‘settled’
13in the United Kingdom at the time of its birth
assumes British citizenship. A child born outside marriage acquirescitizenship through his or her mother, unless the child is legitimated by thesubsequent marriage of his or her parents. Prior to the 1981 Act, any person(with minor exceptions) born in the United Kingdom became a British citizen. 
Adoption and legitimation
A child14adopted by a British citizen becomes a British citizen from the date
of the adoption order. Where the adopters are married, the child becomes aBritish citizen provided that one of the adoptive parents is a citizen. A childborn out of wedlock and subsequently legitimated by the marriage of his orher parents shall be treated as legitimate for the purposes of the BritishNationality Act 1981.
15
Descent
A child born outside the United Kingdom becomes a citizen if one of his orher parents is a British citizen, provided that that parent has not also acquiredcitizenship through descent. Where the child is born to a parent who acquiredcitizenship through descent, the child will only acquire citizenship if theparent is an employee of the Crown, or other designated services.
16
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Rahman (1997), the
Court of Appeal ruled that, where a court had to establish the truth relating toa precedent fact on which the Secretary of State formed the opinion that aperson had entered the country by deception and was an illegal entrant, thecourt was entitled to take into account all the material on which the decisionmaker had relied, even though that might be hearsay. The onus was on theSecretary of State to establish, to a level of proof appropriate to a crime in civilproceedings, that the person was an illegal entrant. On the facts, by a majority,the court ruled that the Secretary of State had done so.Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
Registration
After a period of residence in the United Kingdom, a person may acquire
citizenship through residence. Children born in the United Kingdom, who arenot automatically entitled to citizenship through birth, have a right to beregistered as citizens at the age of ten years, provided that the child has notbeen absent from the United Kingdom for more than 90 days in each of thefirst ten years.
17A child is also entitled to registration if one of his or her
parents acquires citizenship or becomes settled in the United Kingdom duringhis or her minority.
18British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens and British Protected Persons19resident for five years in the United
Kingdom are also entitled to registration.20The Home Secretary has a general
discretion to register any child as a British citizen.21
Naturalisation
Persons not covered by the provisions of the 1981 British Nationality Act mayacquire citizenship through naturalisation. A five year residence period is aprecondition for applying for naturalisation, which is granted at the discretionof the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary, in deciding whether to grantnaturalisation, must be satisfied that the applicant is of ‘good character’, has acommand of the English, Welsh or Gaelic language, and intends to have his orher principal residence in the United Kingdom, unless employed in adesignated form of employment as specified in the Act.
22Naturalisation may
also confer citizenship on the spouse of a British citizen.23Where citizenship is
conferred through naturalisation, the Home Secretary’s decision is final and isnot subject to appeal.

Hong Kong
The Hong Kong Act 1985 created the status of British Nationals (Overseas) forHong Kong citizens after the transfer of sovereignty from the UnitedKingdom to China in 1997. Under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act1990, the Home Secretary could confer citizenship on up to 50,000 Hong Kongresidents, nominated by the Governor of Hong Kong, to enable them to live inthe United Kingdom in the future if they wish to leave Hong Kong after thetransfer of power.
27
British overseas citizenship
Any person who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesimmediately before the commencement of the Act, and who does not becomeeither a British citizen or British Dependent Territories citizen by virtue of theAct, becomes a British Overseas citizen. Overseas citizenship may otherwisebe acquired through registration during a child’s minority

through marriage.29

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENSHIP
The Treaty on European Union 1992, as amended by the Treaty on European
Union 1997 (TEU), confers Union citizenship on the citizens of all MemberStates.
32Under the 1992 Treaty, asylum policy, immigration, control over
external borders and policies relating to nationals of third countries, was oneof the designated areas of common interest between Member States, and fellwithin the Justice and Home Affairs pillar.
33Member States were under a
duty to co-operate in these matters, and to act in compliance with theEuropean Convention on Human Rights and the 1951 Convention on theStatus of Refugees. There was common agreement that the working of thirdpillar of the Union structure – Justice and Home Affairs – was unsatisfactory.As a result, under the Treaty on European Union 1997 (the Treaty ofAmsterdam), as discussed in Chapter 8, all issues relating to the freemovement of persons within the Union, including asylum, visas andimmigration, have now been placed under Community law and its lawmaking processes, while issues relating to crime and the police remain in thethird pillar. 
Freedom of movement and rights of establishment are a central feature of
the European Union and Community. The elimination of border controlsbetween Member States – which the United Kingdom government is currentlyresisting – further extends the freedom of movement for persons within theterritorial boundaries of the European Union. 
Article 4(4) of Council Directive of 1968, on the abolition of restrictions on
movement and residence within the European Community for workers ofMember States and their families
34provides that:
A member of the family who is not a national of a member state shall be issued
with a residence document which shall have the same validity as that issued tothe worker on whom he is dependent.
The Treaty on European Union 1992 introduced the concept of European
citizenship. This is reaffirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union1997 (the Amsterdam Treaty), which states that, among the objectives of theUnion, is the aim to:
... to strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of national of its
Member States through the introduction of a citizenship of the Union.
Articles 17 and 18 of the EC Treaty provide that:
Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding thenationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of theUnion shall complement and not replace national citizenship.
75532 See, further, Chapter 8. Note that the TEU 1997 renumbers all the EC Treaty Articles. 
33 It was thus outside the European Community structure. On the distinction, see, further,
Chapter 8.
34 68/360/EEC (OJ Special English edn, 11, 1968, p 485), as amended by Dec 95/1/EC (OJ
L1/1, 1995).

Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights conferred by this Treaty and shall
be subject to the duties imposed thereby.
Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within
the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laiddown in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.
In addition to rights of residence, every citizen of the Union has the right to
stand as a candidate and to vote in municipal elections in the Member State inwhich he or she resides,
35and to stand as a candidate and vote in elections for
the European Parliament.36Union citizens are entitled to protection from the
diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State.37Citizens of the
Union have the right to petition the European Parliament under Article 194 ofthe Treaty, and have the right also to apply to the European UnionOmbudsman under Article 195.
38
The free movement of persons provisions under the EC Treaty founded
the basis for the development of the idea of European citizenship. The ideas offree movement of persons and rights of establishment within the commonmarket were essentially linked to the economic aspects of the Community.The concept of citizenship now adopted under the TEU is far broader thanthis, and reflects the wider political and social union which is aspired to. TheCommission has the duty to develop further the concept of citizenship and toreport to the European Parliament, and the Council on developments. TheCouncil has the power to adopt the proposals of the Commission, followingconsultation with the European Parliament, and acting unanimously, whichthe Council will recommend for adoption by Member States.
Under the Schengen Agreement of 1985–95, several Member States agreed
to remove all forms of border controls between their countries. Thisagreement is now formally incorporated, under the Treaty on EuropeanUnion 1997, into the EC Treaty; see, further, Chapter 8. In respect of theUnited Kingdom and Ireland, however, opt outs were negotiated, in order toallow these Member States to preserve border controls, in light of theirparticular geographical characteristics.
39
Although Article 8 confers citizenship, and the EC Treaty provides for the
free movement of workers and rights of establishment, this does not give anunqualified right for residents of other Member States to enter and remain inthe United Kingdom. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte
Vitale (1996), for example, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was clear from the
case law of the European Court of Justice that Article 48 of the EC Treaty (nowArticle 39), which confers freedom of movement for work, does not conferunlimited freedom in relation to residence. Article 39 protects those who areChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law
75635 EC Treaty, Article 19.

37Ibid, Article 20.

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
actively seeking work, and a Member State is justified in requiring the person
to leave the country where he had been unsuccessful in securing employmentfor six months, unless he could demonstrate that he was actively continuing toseek employment, and that he had a real chance of being engaged. The Treatyon European Union had not affected that legal position. 
Further, in Sahota v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Zeghraba v
Same (1997), on appeal by the Secretary of State against decisions of the
Immigration Appeal Tribunal granting indefinite leave to remain in theUnited Kingdom to Sahota and Zeghraba, the Court of Appeal ruled that aperson who was not a citizen of a Member State of the European Communitybut was married to a British citizen, was not entitled under Community law tothe same rights of residence in the United Kingdom as those enjoyed by hisspouse under UK law when they returned to live and work in the UnitedKingdom. 
The Court of Appeal ruled that spouses of United Kingdom citizens did
not on marriage automatically become entitled to identical rights. Their entryinto the UK was subject to immigration controls. The rights underCommunity law were not to be amalgamated with those which arose underdomestic law within the territory of Member States for their own nationalsand spouses. National law continued to distinguish between British citizenswith a right of abode and citizens of the Community exercising Communityrights. The Secretary of State’s appeal was allowed.
40
The distinction between entry into the United Kingdom under
Community law and national rights of residence was also considered, by theCourt of Appeal, in Boukssid v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1998) .
In that case, the spouse of a British citizen had been admitted underCommunity law. Whereas, under national law, she would have had a right toindefinite leave to remain, that was not the position when she had entered theUnited Kingdom under Community law. Counsel for the applicant arguedthat, provided the applicant had entered the country lawfully, the basis onwhich she had entered was irrelevant. Further, he argued that the length ofresidency requirements which applied to the applicant, but not to a national,were discriminatory and contrary to Article 12 of the EC Treaty. Botharguments were rejected.
41
Rights of entry and residence
Rights of entry and residence are inextricably linked to the question ofcitizenship. The United Nations International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, provides that ‘No oneshall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country’.
42The
75740 See also Ahmed, Ahmed and Barrow v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2000).
41 On the Human Rights Act 1998, see below.
42 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 12(4).

United Kingdom entered a reservation in respect of this broadly phrased right
under international law, by which it reserved the right to ‘continue to applysuch immigration legislation governing entry into, stay in and departure fromthe United Kingdom’ as it deems necessary.
43
Establishing the right to enter
The holding of a valid British passport identifying that person as a Britishcitizen or as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies having the right ofabode in the United Kingdom, or travel document of a European UnionMember State entitles the holder to entry. Passports may be issued by thePassport Agency for a full ten year period, or for a lesser period, or a Britishvisitor’s passport may be issued. Full passports are only issued once thePassport Agency is satisfied as to the accuracy of the application andsupporting documentation. Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971
44provides
that:
(8) When any question arises under this Act whether or not a person is a
British citizen ... it shall lie on the person asserting it to prove that he is. 
(9) A person seeking to enter the United Kingdom and claiming to have the
right of abode there shall prove that he has that right by means of either:
(a) a United Kingdom passport describing him as a British citizen or as a
citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies having the right of abode
in the United Kingdom; or
(b) a certificate of entitlement issued by or on behalf of the government of
the United Kingdom certifying that he has such a right of abode.
The holding of a passport, however, is not conclusive proof of the right to
enter. Where as passport has been obtained as a result of fraud, or theft, thenan immigration officer who suspects that this is the case is entitled to requirethat the passport holder substantiate his or her claim to be the legitimateholder of the passport. In these situations, therefore, the burden of proof as toidentity rests with the passport holder. However, where the Passport Agencyhas indisputably issued a passport to the holder, albeit one of a limitedduration, the issue arises – should a dispute occur over the matter – as towhere the burden of proof lies over the issue of the validity of that passportand the right of its holder to enter. A British Visitor’s passport isdistinguishable from a full passport, albeit of limited duration. A visitor’spassport does not qualify for section 3(9) purposes.
45
The issue was tested in the Queen’s Bench Division in R v Home Secretary
ex parte Obi (1997). In Obi, the passport agency had issued a passport limited
to six month’s duration. When he applied for a renewal of the passport, heChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

was arrested and served with a notice directed to him as an illegal immigrant,
on the basis that, notwithstanding the passport, the Secretary of State was notsatisfied that the applicant was Obi, and that the onus of proof of identity,once queried, lay with the applicant to prove that he was the person whomthe passport described as a British citizen. The applicant sought judicialreview. The question which fell for answer was the question as to who wasunder the duty to satisfy the burden of proof: the applicant or the HomeSecretary:
... the principal question I have to decide is, however, one of pure law: is it for
the Secretary of State to satisfy the court that the applicant is an illegal entrantor for the applicant to satisfy the court that he is not?
Sedley J ruled that on the balance of probabilities in light of the evidence as to
identity of the applicant, and the evidence which the applicant refused todisclose, the applicant had not proven that he was the person for whom thepassport had been issued. However, that finding was not determinative of theissue. The Secretary of State was unable to discharge the burden of proofwhich the statute placed upon him, showing that the passport issued, naminghim as Mr Obi and describing him as a British citizen, does not entitle him to aright of abode. The application for judicial review accordingly succeeded. 
Rights of entry and abode: immigration policy and citizenship
status
Immigration, asylum and deportation law is a complex web of statutes, with
Acts of Parliament being enacted in piecemeal fashion and no attempt beingmade to consolidate the law in a manageable, comprehensive form. TheImmigration Act 1971, Immigration Act 1988, Asylum and ImmigrationAppeals Act 1993, the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and the Immigrationand Asylum Act 1999 are the Immigration Acts regulating the area. In order todetermine rights of entry for other than British citizens and others referred toabove, it is necessary to consider immigration law and policy in light ofcitizenship status to which the policy is linked. 
Immigration policy
The first modern statutory control over immigration was provided by theAliens Act 1905, which permitted the refusal of entry to persons regarded as‘undesirable’. By the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, more favourabletreatment was given to descendants of white immigrants than to citizens ofthe New Commonwealth.
46The Immigration Act 1971, as amended,47
together with the Immigration Rules, provides the structure of immigrationlaw. Rights of entry are determined by citizenship status under the British
75946 See Evans, 1983, p 3.
47 By the British Nationality Act 1981.

Nationality Act 1981. As noted above, section 1 of the Immigration Act 1971
provides that those who ‘have a right of abode shall be free to live in, and tocome and go into and from, the United Kingdom without let or hindrance’subject to restrictions enabling their status to be determined.
48Those who do
not have the right of abode, may live, work and settle in the United Kingdom‘by permission and subject to such regulation and control of their entry into,stay in and departure from the United Kingdom’.
49
A person who has the right of abode is a person who is a British citizen, or
a Commonwealth citizen who was a Commonwealth citizen having the rightof abode immediately before the commencement of the British Nationality Act1981, and who has not ceased meanwhile to be a Commonwealth citizen.
50
Where a person is not a British citizen (or a Commonwealth citizen as definedabove), section 3 states that a person ‘shall not enter the United Kingdomunless given leave to do so under this Act’. Leave may be given to enter theUnited Kingdom either for a limited period or for an indefinite period. Wherelimited leave is given for entry into the United Kingdom, the leave may besubject to conditions restricting an individual’s right of employment oroccupation, or requirements to register with the police, or both. The leave toenter may be varied. The leave may be restricted or enlarged, or added to byvarying or revoking conditions.
The general provision relating to regulation and control is section 3 of the
Immigration Act 1971, as amended, which provides in part that:
(1) Except as otherwise provided by or under this Act, where is person is not
[a British citizen]:
(a) he shall not enter the United Kingdom unless given leave to do so in
accordance with this Act;
(b) he may be given leave to enter the United Kingdom (or, when already
there, leave to remain in the United Kingdom) either for a limited or
for an indefinite period;
(c) if he is given limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, it
may be given subject to all or any of the following conditions, namely –
(i) a condition restricting his employment or occupation in the United
Kingdom;
(ii) a condition requiring him to maintain and accommodate himself,
and any dependants of his, without recourse to public funds; and
(iii) a condition requiring him to register with the police.
The Home Secretary has the power to lay down rules for the regulation of
entry and stay in the United Kingdom, and these must be laid beforeparliament. The rules are subject to nullification by parliament within 40 daysof being laid. Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

50Ibid, s 2.

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
Section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, as amended by the Immigration and Asylum
Act 1999,51provides that a person who is not a British citizen is liable to
deportation from the United Kingdom if:
(a) the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public
good; or
(b) another person to whose family he belongs is or has been ordered to be
deported.
Where a person is given leave to enter and remain, that leave may be
indefinite or limited. Where it is limited, that leave may be varied, whether byrestricting, enlarging or removing the limit on its duration, or by adding,varying or revoking conditions.
52The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
makes further provision in relation to the giving, refusing or varying of leaveto enter the United Kingdom, and the Secretary of State may make orders bystatutory instrument which must be laid before parliament and approved by aresolution of each House. Provision may be made for leave to be given orrefused before a person arrives in the United Kingdom, for the manner orform in which leave may be given, refused or varied, for the imposition ofconditions, and that a person’s leave to enter not lapse on his leaving thecommon travel area (as per section 3 of the 1971 Act).
53The Secretary of State
also has power to make statutory instruments, subject to parliamentaryapproval, regulating leave to remain in the United Kingdom, including theform or manner in which leave may be given, refused or varied, theimposition of conditions and providing that a person’s leave to remain doesnot lapse on his leaving the common travel area.
54
The Immigration Act 1971, as amended, created a number of criminal
offences relating to immigration matters. Under the Act, it is a criminaloffence to enter the country illegally;
55to fail to observe conditions of leave; to
assist illegal immigrants; or to obtain leave to remain by deception. A personwho is not a British citizen is liable for deportation from the United Kingdomif he or she has a limited leave to enter does and not observe conditionsattached, or remains beyond the time limited by the leave, or if the Secretaryof State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good, or if amember of his or her family has been ordered to be deported.
56A person may
also be deported if, when over the age of 17, he is convicted of an offence forwhich he is punishable by imprisonment, and on conviction, there is arecommendation by the court for deportation.
57The Act provides that any

person claiming entitlement to British citizenship bears the onus of proof that
he is a citizen.58Such proof may be established either by the production of a
British passport, or a certificate of entitlement certifying that a person has aright of abode issued by, or on behalf of, the government of the UnitedKingdom.
59
The powers to control immigration are under the responsibility of the
Home Secretary, but, in practice, are entrusted to immigration officers subjectto review by the courts. Powers to give leave to remain in the UnitedKingdom, or to vary conditions of leave, are exercisable by the Secretary ofState.
60Deportation orders are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for
the Home Office (the Home Secretary). The effect of a deportation order is toinvalidate any leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.
61A
deportation order may be made against members of a deportee’s family, butshall not be made against a family member if eight weeks have elapsed sincethe deportee left the country, or if a person has ceased to be a member of thedeportee’s family.
62The making of a deportation order while a claim for
asylum is outstanding is invalid.63
Commonwealth citizens, or citizens of the Republic of Ireland who were
ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom at the time the Act came into forceare not liable to deportation, provided that they have remained ordinarilyresident in the United Kingdom or British Islands since the Act came intoforce, or have for the five years previous to the Secretary of State’s decisionbeen resident in the United Kingdom and Islands, or upon conviction for anoffence, if they have been ordinarily resident for the previous five years.
64
Appeals against immigration decisions and deportation orders
The immigration appeal structure was established by the ImmigrationAppeals Act 1969, and now falls under the Immigration Act 1971.Adjudicators are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. Above the adjudicators isthe Immigration Appeal Tribunal, whose President is a lawyer of not less thanseven years’ standing. Members of the Tribunal, which sits in two divisions,each having three members, are also appointed by the Lord Chancellor. Thesystem is subject to the supervision of the Council on Tribunals. Before 1993,there was no further right of appeal against the decision of the ImmigrationChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Appeal Tribunal, although judicial review proceedings were available. Section
9 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 provides a right of appealon point of law, with leave to the Court of Appeal or to the Scottish Court ofSession. Additionally, the Home Secretary has the power to uphold or reversea decision. 
Under section 13 of the Immigration Act 1971, a person who has been
refused leave to enter has a right of appeal to an adjudicator against thedecision. No right of appeal lies against a decision regarding leave to enterunless the person has a passport or certificate as required by section 3(9).Under the 1971 Act, no person had a right of appeal unless he was refusedentry at a port of entry and at a time when he held a current entry clearance. Aperson entering the United Kingdom as a visitor, or as a student or as adependent person is not entitled to appeal against a refusal of an entryclearance or against a refusal of leave to enter unless he held a current entryclearance at the time of the refusal.
Appeals against conditions lie to an adjudicator. A person is not entitled to
appeal against a variation of his leave which reduces its duration, or againstany refusal to enlarge or remove the limits of its duration if the Secretary ofState certifies that the person’s departure from the United Kingdom would be‘to the public good’.
65The adjudicator also has jurisdiction to hear appeals
against deportation orders.66No deportation order shall be made while an
appeal may be lodged, or while the appeal is pending.67The adjudicator may
allow the appeal on the basis that a decision taken was not in accordance withthe law, or with applicable immigration rules or, where the decision involvedthe exercise of discretion by the Home Secretary, the discretion has beenimproperly exercised.
68Appeals against the decision of an adjudicator may be
made to an Appeal Tribunal which may affirm the determination, or vary it.69
Special provisions apply to suspected terrorists: see below.
Extradition
Extradition is the means by which a fugitive from another country is returnedto that country. The Extradition Act 1989
70now governs the law. The law
applies to all persons, irrespective of citizenship and extends extradition to allforeign countries, Commonwealth states and colonies. An exception exists inthe relation to the Republic of Ireland, which is regulated by the Backing ofWarrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965. Whereas deportation is at the

instance of the Home Secretary, extradition is commenced by way of a request
from another country to the United Kingdom’s Home Secretary for the returnof the person.
71Only countries with whom a bilateral Treaty has been entered
into, may request extradition. If the Home Secretary is satisfied as to therequest, the matter is referred to a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate whomay issue an arrest warrant.
72On arrest, the person is brought before the
magistrate for committal into the custody of the Home Secretary.73
An offence for which extradition may be ordered is one which, if
committed in the United Kingdom, would carry a term of imprisonment of 12months or more and carries the same punishment in the requesting state andwhere, if committed outside the United Kingdom, would amount to an extra-territorial offence against the United Kingdom or, in a case where therequesting state’s jurisdiction is dependent upon the nationality of theoffender, the offence would be an offence under the law of the UnitedKingdom.
74No extradition may be granted for a purely political offence, or
where the request for the return of the person is based on race, religion,nationality or political opinions.
75The question of what amounts to a political
offence is one for the court to determine, and the categories are not closed.However, terrorist acts will not be regarded as ‘political offences’. TheSuppression of Terrorism Act 1978 and the European Convention on theSuppression of Terrorism
76aim to preclude terrorists pleading that their
actions are political and, accordingly, offences for which extradition will beallowed include murder, kidnapping and the use of imitation firearms. 
A person detained must be notified of his right to make representations to
the Home Secretary as to why he should not be extradited. The detainee hasthe right to institute judicial review proceedings to test the lawfulness of theHome Secretary’s decision, and may apply for habeas corpus to review thelegality of his detention. If the decision is challenged unsuccessfully, theHome Secretary may extradite the person. If there are no legal proceedingsundertaken, the person may be returned after 15 days from the date ofcommittal. If the requesting state is not satisfied with the Home Secretary’sdecision not to commit the person, it may apply for a review.
77
Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Republic
of Ireland are governed by the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act1965, which in part provides for an extradition order to be made where anoffence has been committed in the Republic of Ireland which corresponds toan offence in the United Kingdom which is an indictable offence orChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months. In R v
Governor of Belmarsh Prison ex parte Gilligan (1999), the House of Lords, on an
application for habeas corpus, ruled that the word ‘correspond’ in relation to
relevant offences was not used in any technical sense and should beunderstood in its ordinary meaning. There was, on the facts, sufficientcorrespondence between charges of murder and of unlawful carnalknowledge. The meaning of the ‘accused’ in section 1 of the Extradition Act1989 was also held not to be a term of art in Re Ismail (1998). The applicant had
applied for habeas corpus challenging the decision to commit him on bail toawait the Secretary of State’s decision whether to extradite him to Germany.He argued that he was not an accused within the meaning of section 1 of theExtradition Act 1989. The House of Lords held that, given the differencesbetween the criminal procedures of various countries and, in particular,between those of England and civil law countries, the word ‘accused’ shouldbe given a broad, general and purposive construction. A person was accusedof an extradition crime in a foreign state if the competent authorities there hadcommenced prosecution.
In R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex parte Government of
the United States of America (1999), the House of Lords considered the concept
of an extradition crime. The Extradition Act 1989 preserved Orders in Councilmade under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1870, relating to giving effect toextradition treaties and the power to amend them. The Treaty between theUnited Kingdom and the United States provided, inter alia, for extradition for
offences listed in the Schedule to the Treaty or any other offence if the offencewas extraditable under the law of the United Kingdom. Section 15 of theComputer Misuse Act 1990 provided that extraditable offences includedoffences relating to computer crime, offences not listed in the Schedule to theTreaty. The House of Lords ruled that the 1990 Act clearly intended to makesuch offences extraditable for the purposes of the Order in Council givingeffect to the Treaty, even though neither the Treaty nor the Order in Councilhad been amended.
78
The House of Lords also considered the scope of extradition crimes under
the Extradition Act 1989 in R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex
parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 3) (1999). The applicant, the former president of the
government junta of Chile from 1973 to 1974, and subsequently Head of Stateof the Chilean Republic until 1980, had been subject to an internationalwarrant for his arrest in respect of murder, genocide and terrorism, and thestipendiary magistrates had issued arrest warrants. On an application forjudicial review, both warrants were quashed on the ground, inter alia ,of
sovereign immunity. The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and theGovernment of Spain appealed. Since the first hearing before the House of
76578 See, also, Re Burke (2000); R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Norgren
(2000); Al-Fawwaz v Governor of Brixton Prison (2000); Charron v Government of the USA
(2000).

Lords, which was set aside on grounds of judicial bias (see, further, Chapters 5
and 26), the crimes alleged had been widened to include offences allegedlycommitted before Pinochet became head of state. Counsel for the defenceclaimed that, irrespective of the issue of sovereign immunity, a number of thealleged offences were not extradition crimes. On that point, the House ofLords ruled that, under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1989, the allegedconduct had to be a crime in the United Kingdom at the time at which thecrimes took place. Extraterritorial torture did not become an offence untilSeptember 1998 when section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 came intoforce. On sovereign immunity, the House of Lords ruled that, by section 20 ofthe State Immunity Act 1978, a former head of state enjoyed immunity for actsdone in his official capacity, but that torture was an international crimeagainst humanity for which there could be no immunity under customaryinternational law, or there could be no immunity after December 1988 whenthe International Convention against Torture 1984 had been ratified by Chile,Spain and the United Kingdom.
THE ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION ACTS 1996 AND 199979
The 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, according to the then Home Secretaryhad three objectives, namely:
First, to strengthen our asylum procedures so that bogus claims and appeals
can be dealt with more quickly; secondly, to combat immigration racketeeringthrough stronger powers, new offences and higher penalties; and, thirdly, toreduce economic incentives which attract people to come to this country inbreach of our immigration laws.
80
The Act amended the administrative procedures for dealing with asylum and
immigration as contained in the Immigration Act 1971 and the Asylum andImmigration Appeals Act 1993. The Act must be seen in light of developmentswithin the European Union, and also in light of international law obligationsunder the United Nation’s Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951and the Convention Against Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment1981 and the European Convention on Human Rights and FundamentalFreedoms 1951. 
The 1996 Act is in part aimed at extending national controls, by providing
safeguards for genuine refugees, and providing for appeals for those refusedasylum before deportation, but expediting the processing of cases whichrepresent bogus claims and tightening up on immigration racketeering. Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

THE IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACT 199981
The Labour government sought to reform the law in the face of substantial
pressure imposed on the administrative system by escalating numbers ofpersons seeking asylum in the United Kingdom. The Home Secretary statedthat the 1999 Act was intended to make the ‘system fairer, faster and firmer’.
82
The 1999 Act makes provision covering most areas of immigration andasylum. The Act is intended to enable genuine travellers to enter more quicklywhile also combating illegal entry and strengthening powers to deal withother persons not entitled to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.
Immigration
Section 1 of the 1999 Act amends section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 (the1971 Act), and is designed to make more flexible and streamlined the grantingof leave to enter. Leave to enter may now be granted, refused or variedoutside the United Kingdom, thus relieving the pressure on immigrationofficers at points of entry and giving greater certainty to travellers intendingto enter the United Kingdom. Under section 2, the Secretary of State may, bystatutory instruments, make further provision in relation to the giving,refusing or varying of leave to remain in the United Kingdom, including theimposition of conditions. Where a person has limited leave to enter or remainand applies to the Secretary of State, before the leave expires, for it to bevaried and no decision has been taken on the application when leave expires,the leave is to be treated as continuing until the end of the period allowedunder the rules relating to appeals against a decision on an application.
83A
person who has overstayed their leave to enter or remain in the UnitedKingdom may, during the regularisation period, which is to be not less thanthree months, apply for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
84However,
whereas previously, overstayers who were liable to deportation had a right ofappeal against deportation which could be exercised before any action wastaken to remove them from the United Kingdom, the right of appeal has beenremoved by the 1999 Act, although persons removed have a right of appealagainst removal on the ground that there was no lawful basis for theirremoval under section 66 (see below, p 775). Section 10 provides that a personwho is not a British citizen may be removed from the United Kingdom inaccordance with directions given by an immigration official if the personhaving limited leave to enter or remain does not observe conditions attachedto the leave or remains beyond the time limit, or has obtained leave to remain
76781 The government certified the Bill as being in conformity with the European Convention
on Human Rights.

by deception. The only protection remaining for such persons is to appeal to
an adjudicator under section 65 alleging that the Immigration Authority hasacted in breach of human rights, or to make a claim for asylum under the 1971Act.
Section 11 of the Act reduces the possibility of challenges by judicial
review (on which see below) to decisions to remove asylum seekers to third
countries which are Member States of the European Union. Whereas in R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Besnik Gashi (1999) and in R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Lul Omar Adan, SittampalanSubaskarant and Hamid Aitesegeur (1999) the claimants argued that Germany
was not a safe third country, section 11 introduces the presumption that allMember States are safe and are to be regarded as places where a person’s lifeand liberty is not threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality,membership of a particular social group or political opinion, and as placesfrom which a person will not be sent to another country otherwise than inaccordance with the Refugee Convention. The remaining avenue for suchpersons is to appeal to an adjudicator under section 65 alleging violation ofConvention rights. Where the Secretary of State intends to remove an asylumclaimant to a third country other than a Member State of the European Union,section 12 applies. Section 12, inter alia, provides that section 15 (restrictions on
removal of asylum claimants while the application is pending) shall notprevent the removal of a claimant if the Secretary of State has certified that theclaimant is not a national or citizen of the country to which he is to be sent,that his life and liberty would not be threatened there as above in relation tosection 11, and that the government of that country would not send him toanother country otherwise than in accordance with the Convention onRefugees.
85Unless such a certificate has been issued, the claimant is not to be
removed from the United Kingdom if he has an appeal pending under section65, or before the time for giving notice of such an appeal has expired.
86
Section 22 of the 1999 Act amends section 8 of the Asylum and
Immigration Act 1996, and provides that the Secretary of State must issue aCode of Practice for employers, advising on the measures to be taken to avoidthe commission of an offence under section 8 (employing a person subject toimmigration control), and also to avoid racial discrimination contrary to theRace Relations Act 1976.
Sections 28 to 30 of the 1999 Act relate to criminal offences in relation to
immigration control. Section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that it isa criminal offence to knowingly enter the United Kingdom in breach of adeportation order or without leave, to use deception in order to obtain leaveto enter or remain, or to breach time limits or conditions of limited leave andrelated offences. Section 28 amends section 24 of the 1971 Act, and relates todeception in relation to obtaining or seeking to obtain leave to enter or remainChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law
76885 Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, s 12(1), (2), (7).

in the United Kingdom, or securing or seeking to secure the avoidance,
postponement or revocation of enforcement action against him (the giving ofdirections for removal under Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act or section 10 of the1999 Act). Section 25 of the 1971 Act makes it a criminal offence to assistunlawful entry and harbouring an unlawful entrant. Section 29 of the 1999 Actincreases the maximum penalty for facilitating illegal entry. Making falsestatements to an immigration officer or obstructing an immigration officeracting lawfully is an offence under section 26 of the 1971 Act, which isamended by section 30 of the 1999 Act to make clear that making falsestatements under any of the post-1971 Immigration Acts is an offence.
Section 31 of the 1999 Act reflects the prohibition in Article 31(1) of the 1951
Convention against penalising refugees for their method of entry to a countryto seek asylum,
87and provides that it is a defence for a refugee charged with
an offence to which this section applies to show that, having come to theUnited Kingdom directly from a country where his life or freedom wasthreatened, he presented himself to the authorities in the United Kingdomwithout delay, showed good cause for his illegal entry or presence and made aclaim for asylum as soon as was reasonably practicable. If the refugee hasstopped in a third country in transit from a country where his life or freedomwas threatened en route to the United Kingdom, the defence in sub-section (1)only applies if he shows that he could not reasonably have expected to begiven protection under the Refugee Convention in that other country.
88
The Immigration Services Commissioner and Immigration
Services Tribunal
The 1999 Act introduces an Immigration Services Commissioner, appointed
by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor andScottish Ministers.
89It is the general duty of the Commissioner to promote
good practice by those who provide immigration advice or immigrationservices.
90The Commissioner will issue a Code of Standards and rules. The
Commissioner will have responsibility for registering those persons or bodiesqualified to provide immigration advice or services.
91The Immigration
Services Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider appeals by persons aggrieved bydecisions of the Commissioner in relation to registration,
92and to consider
disciplinary charges laid by the Commissioner in relation to registeredpersons or bodies providing immigration advice or services.

Carriers’ liability
Part II of the Act imposes civil liability on persons responsible for the
transport of ‘clandestine entrants’ to the United Kingdom and repeals andreplaces the Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1987.
94Civil liability covers
all vehicles, trains, ships or aircraft bringing clandestine entrants to the UnitedKingdom, and provides power to detain such vehicles, ships or aircraft assecurity until all charges for the carriage of illegal entrants have been paid.The definition of clandestine entrant is broad.
Section 32(1) provides that a person is a clandestine entrant if:
(a) he arrives in the United Kingdom concealed in a vehicle, ship or aircraft,
(b) he passes, or attempt to pass, through immigration control concealed in a
vehicle, or
(c) he arrives in the United Kingdom on a ship or aircraft, having embarked:
(i) concealed in a vehicle;(ii) at a time when the ship or aircraft was outside the United Kingdom,
and claims, or indicated that he intends to seek, asylum in the United
Kingdom or evades, or attempts to evade, immigration control.
‘Immigration control’ means United Kingdom immigration control and
includes any United Kingdom immigration control operated in a prescribedcontrol zone outside the United Kingdom,
95with the effect that a person may
be a clandestine entrant even though he or she does not arrive in the UnitedKingdom. The prescribed control zones will be defined by regulation.
The ‘responsible person’, defined in section 32(5) and (6), is liable to a
penalty for each clandestine entrant, irrespective of whether the responsibleperson knew or suspected that a clandestine entrant was concealed in thetransporter, or that there were one or more other persons concealed with theclandestine entrant in the same transporter.
96Liability is fixed at £2,000 per
clandestine entrant. It is a defence for the carrier to show that he or anemployee was acting under duress, and for the carrier to show that he did notknow and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that a clandestine entrantwas or might be concealed in the transporters or that an effective system forpreventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation and that, onthe occasion in question, the responsible person was operating that systemproperly. If the Secretary of State decides that a person is liable, he must issuea penalty notice stating the reasons for deciding that the person is liable, theamount of the penalty or penalties, the date before which the penalty must bepaid, and include an explanation of the steps to be taken if the person objectsChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

to the penalty If a penalty notice has been issued, a senior officer (which
means an officer not below the rank of Chief Immigration Officer) may detainthe relevant vehicle, small ship or small aircraft, as defined in section 43, untilall penalties have been paid, but the power may only be exercised if there is asignificant risk that the penalty will not be paid in the prescribed time if thetransporter is not detained, and may not be exercised if alternative securityhas been given. The detention of the transporter is lawful, even though it issubsequently established that the penalty notice was ill founded, unless theSecretary of State was acting unreasonably in issuing the penalty notice.Where a transporter is detained, the owner or responsible persons or anyperson with an interest in the transporter may apply to the court for itsrelease. The court may order its release if satisfactory security has beentendered, there is no significant risk that the penalty will not be paid or thereis significant doubt whether the penalty is payable and the applicant has acompelling need to have the transporter released. If the court does not orderrelease, the Secretary of State may sell the transporter if the penalty is not paidbefore the end of a period of 84 days beginning on the date on which thedetention began. Provision is also made for the detention of ships, aircraft andvehicles following the arrest of a person in connection with offences relatingto assisting illegal entry and harbouring an unlawful entrant.
97
Where an owner of a ship, aircraft or vehicle, or train operator transports a
passenger without proper immigration documents, that carrier is liable to acharge of £2,000 or such other sum as may be prescribed. The charge ispayable to the Secretary of State on demand. No charge is payable if theperson is shown to have produced the required documentation, or, in relationto a train operator or owner of a road passenger vehicle, if the law applicableto the place where the person embarked prohibits the production ofdocumentation or satisfactory arrangements designed to ensure that suchpassengers were not carried were in place, or, where all steps were taken toensure that the person had the required documents, or where that personrefused to produce the documentation, that all practicable steps were taken toprevent his or her arrival in the United Kingdom. Where payment of a chargeis pending, a senior officer may detain the transporter, the release of whichmay be ordered by a court on the same grounds as under section 37.

International Transport Roth GmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001), in
which the High Court ruled that the penalties were disproportionate.

Bail
Under the Immigration Acts,99persons seeking leave to enter the United
Kingdom, persons who are illegal entrants and those subject to deportation
proceedings may be detained. Persons suspected of offences under theImmigration Acts may also be detained, although in those cases the rulesrelating to bail on criminal charges apply. Previously, decisions to detainpersons had not been attended by independent judicial supervision. The 1999Act seeks to remedy this situation by providing for bail hearings for thosepersons detained under the 1971 Act. The 1999 Act does not amend the rightto bail, but provides that the Secretary of State may do so by way ofregulations.
100The Secretary of State must arrange a reference to the court for
it to determine whether the detained person should be released on bail.101
Exceptions to the section 44(2) duty to refer apply in relation to personsdetained other than under a provision of the 1971 Act, or where a person isliable to deportation as a result of a recommendation of a court or if theperson concerned has given written notice to the Secretary of State that hedoes not wish his or her case to be referred to the court.
102Section 46 provides
that the court must release the detained person on bail, subject to exceptions.These exceptions include where the court is satisfied that there are substantialgrounds for believing that, if released, he or she would fail to comply with bailconditions, or commit an offence while on bail, or be likely to cause danger topublic health, or be a serious threat to the maintenance of public order.
103
Also, the detained person need not be granted bail if the court is satisfied thathe or she is or has been knowingly involved in a concerted attempt to enterthe United Kingdom in breach of immigration law, or he or she is sufferingfrom a mental disorder and his or her detention is necessary in his or her owninterests or for the protection of others, or he or she is under the age of 18 andno satisfactory arrangements have been made for his or her care on release, orhe or she is required to submit to an examination by immigration officers ormedical examiners,
104or there are directions in force for his or her removal
from the United Kingdom. A detained person also need not be granted bail ifthe court is satisfied that he or she falls within the national security provisionsof section 3(2) of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997,which provides that the Secretary of State has certified that his or herdetention is necessary in the interests of national security, or that he or she isdetained following a decision to refuse him or her leave to enter on the basisof national security or that he or she is detained following a decision to make aChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

107
Immigration and asylum appeals
Part IV and Schedules 2, 3 and 4 to the 1999 Act reform the system ofimmigration and asylum appeals with a view to providing a comprehensiveright of appeal replacing the multiplicity of appeal mechanisms formerly inplace. Other than in relation to national security cases, where the person mayappeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission under the 1997Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997,
108all other persons may
appeal under the 1999 Act, which repeals appeal provisions under earlierlegislation. The right of appeal extends to decisions requiring a person to seekleave or the refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom under the 1971Act.
109Where, before an appeal is lodged, directions have been given for the
person’s removal from the United Kingdom, or before or after he or sheappeals, the Secretary of State or an immigration officer serves notice thatdirections for his removal will be for removal to a country or one of severalcountries specified in the notice, the appellant may object to the country towhich he or she would be removed and claim that he or she ought to beremoved, if at all, to a different country specified by him or her.
110Section 60
of the 1999 Act makes detailed provisions limiting rights of appeal undersection 59, largely replicating the provisions of the Immigration Act 1971.There is the right to appeal decisions to vary, or refuse to vary any limitedleave to enter or remain if, as a result of that decision, the person may berequired to leave the United Kingdom within 28 days of being notified of thedecision.
111The right of appeal under section 61 is limited by the provisions
of section 62. Less detailed than the restrictions in section 60, section 62provides for four situations to which the right to appeal does not apply. Aperson may not appeal against a refusal to vary leave if the refusal is on theground that the relevant document which is required by the ImmigrationRules has not been issued, or if the person does not satisfy a requirement ofthe Immigration Rules as to age or nationality or citizenship, or the variationwould result in the duration of a person’s leave exceeding that permitted by

the Immigration Rules, or where any required fee has not been paid. The right
to appeal against a decision to deport a person under the 1971 Act, or therefusal of the Secretary of State to revoke a deportation order, is regulatedunder sections 62 and 63. A person is entitled to appeal against the making ofa deportation order by the Secretary of State under section 5(1) of theImmigration Act 1971 as a result of his liability to deportation under section3(5) of that Act, or the refusal to revoke a deportation order. Under the 1999Act, deportation appeals are limited to cases where deportation is deemed bythe Secretary of State to be ‘conducive to the public good’ and cases where‘another person to whose family he belongs is or has been ordered to bedeported’.
112Where the Secretary of State serves notice that directions will be
given for his or her removal to a country, or one of several specified countries,the person may object to the specified country and claim that he or she oughtto be removed, if at all, to a different country specified by him or her. Adeportation order is not to be made under section 5(1) of the 1971 Act againsta person while an appeal may be brought against the decision to make it.
113
Section 64 restricts the right of appeal under section 63, providing that theright to appeal is not available where deportation is ordered as beingconducive to the public good, in the interests of national security or ofrelations between the United Kingdom and any other country, or ‘for otherreasons of a political nature’. No right of appeal lies against a refusal to revokea deportation order if the Secretary of State has certified that the appellant’sexclusion from the United Kingdom is conducive to the public good.
Section 65 of the 1999 Act makes provision in relation to Convention rights
under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. If, under the ImmigrationActs, a public authority acts in breach of a person’s human rights, by acting orfailing to act in a way made unlawful by section 6(1), the person may appealto an adjudicator, unless he or she has grounds for appealing against thedecision under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. 
Where directions are given for the removal of a person on being refused
leave to enter, or on a deportation order being made against him or her, orthat person entering the United Kingdom in breach of a deportation order, anappeal lies to an adjudicator on the ground that he or she ought to beremoved, if at all, to a different country specified by him or her.
114Section 68
restricts the right of appeal under section 67, inter alia, providing that, where a
person has objected to a specified country and has stipulated another countryof destination, if he or she is not a national or citizen of that other country, heor she must prove that the country will admit him or her.Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
Appeals in relation to asylum claims are regulated under section 69 of the
1999 Act. A person who is refused leave to enter may appeal on the ground
that his or her removal would be contrary to the Convention on Refugees. Adecision varying or refusing to vary a person’s limited leave to enter orremain may also be appealed against to an adjudicator, on the ground thatsuch a requirement would be contrary to the Convention on Refugees, if itresults in the person being required to leave the United Kingdom within 28days. Further, a person who has been refused leave to enter or remain, but hasbeen granted limited leave to enter or remain, may, if that limited leave willnot expire within 28 days of notification, appeal on Convention grounds to anadjudicator. Where the Secretary of State has decided to make a deportationorder or refused to revoke such an order, an appeal lies to an adjudicator onConvention grounds, as it does if directions are given under section 66(1) forthe removal of the person from the United Kingdom. The right of appeal isrestricted by section 70 of the 1999 Act, and section 69 does not entitle aperson to appeal against refusal of leave to enter if the Secretary of Statecertifies, personally, that the exclusion is in the interests of national security. Aperson is not entitled to appeal against a variation of leave which reduces itsduration or a refusal to enlarge to remove the limit on its duration if theSecretary of State has certified that the appellant’s departure would be in theinterests of national security, or that the decision questioned by the appealwas taken on that ground by the Secretary of State personally. Where a personhas been refused leave to enter or remain on the basis of a claim for asylum,but has been granted limited leave to enter or remain, no right of appeal lies ifthe reason for the refusal was that he or she was a person to whom theConvention did not apply and the Secretary of State has certified that thedisclosure of material on which the refusal was based is not in the interests ofnational security. A person is not entitled to appeal against a refusal to revokea deportation order where the Secretary of State has certified that exclusion isin the interests of national security, or where revocation was refused on thatground.

Support for asylum seekers
Part VI of the 1999 Act provides support for asylum seekers and theirdependants. Asylum seekers are taken out of the benefits system
116and
detailed provision is made for their support under the Act. Support may begiven through the provision of accommodation which is ‘adequate’, providingfor the essential living needs of the supported person, enabling the person tomeet expenses (other than legal and other prescribed expenses) in relation to
775115 On procedures relating to appeal, see the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, ss 74–76.
116 The exclusion from benefits covers jobseeker’s allowance, attendance allowance, severe
disablement allowance, invalid care allowance, disability living allowance, income
support, working families’ tax credit, disabled persons’ tax credit, social fund payments,child benefit, housing benefit, council tax benefit: ibid, s 115.

asylum claims, enabling the asylum seeker to attend bail proceedings.117If the
circumstances of a particular case are ‘exceptional’, the Secretary of State may
provide such support as he considers necessary to enable the supportedperson to be supported.
118Local authorities may also provide support in
accordance with arrangements made by the Secretary of State.119Where the
Secretary of State asks a local authority to assist him in providing supportunder section 95, the local authority must co-operate in the provision ofaccommodation.
120In order to spread the burden of providing for asylum
seekers throughout the country in an equitable manner, the Secretary of Statehas power to designate reception zones in relation to the provision of support,including accommodation.
121Where the Secretary of State decides that an
applicant for support under section 95 is not qualified for support, theapplicant may appeal to an Asylum Support Adjudicator.
122The Act
introduces a number of offences relating to support. It is an offence to makefalse representations, dishonest representations, or to delay or obstruct,without reasonable excuse, a person exercising functions relating to support,or to refuse or neglect to undertake an obligation to maintain a supportedperson, having given a written undertaking to do so.
123On the compatibility
of these provisions with the Human Rights Act 1998, see below.
Powers of arrest, search and fingerprinting
Part VII of the 1999 Act increases the powers of immigration officers inrelation to entry of premises, arrest and search of suspects, and introduces apower to fingerprint persons suspected of immigration offences. Arrestwithout warrant is regulated by section 128, amending section 28 of the 1971Act, and provides for the arrest of a person who has committed or attemptedto commit an offence under section 24 or 24A (illegal entry and deception), oroffences under section 25(1) (assisting illegal entry) and obstruction of animmigration officer under section 26(1)(g). Search and arrest by warrant isgoverned by section 129, amending section 28 of the 1971 Act. For the purposeof arresting a person for an offence under section 25(1) (assisting illegal entry),an immigration officer may enter and search any premises, but the power maybe exercised only to the extent that it is reasonably required for that purposeand only if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the personwhom he is seeking is on the premises.

premises for evidence is under warrant.124Following arrest at a place other
than a police station, an immigration officer may enter and search any
premises in which the person was when arrested, or in which he wasimmediately before he was arrested for evidence relating to the offence forwhich the arrest was made. The power may only be exercised if the officer hasreasonable grounds for believing that there is relevant evidence on thepremises and only to the extent that it is reasonably required for the purposeof discovering the relevant evidence.
125Similar powers of entry and search of
premises following arrest under section 25(1) of the 1971 Act are provided bysection 133, amending section 28 of the Act. Where a person is arrested at aplace other than a police station, an immigration officer may search thearrested person if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrestedperson may present a danger to him or herself or others. The search may beconducted to search for anything which might be used to escape from lawfulcustody, and anything which might be evidence relating to the offence forwhich he or she was arrested. The power may only be exercised on reasonablegrounds and to the extent reasonably required. The power conferred does notauthorise an officer to require a person to remove any clothing in public otherthan an outer coat, jacket or gloves, but does authorise the search of a person’smouth. Evidence discovered may be seized.
126Where a person is arrested
under Schedule 2, an immigration officer may search the person on similargrounds to those above, save that the immigration officer may also search forany document which might establish his or her identity, nationality orcitizenship, or indicate the place from which he or she has travelled to theUnited Kingdom or to which he or she is proposing to go.
127Similar powers
relate to the search of persons in police custody, and provide that animmigration officer may search to see if the arrested person has anything withhim or her which might be used to cause physical injury to him or herself orothers, damage property, interfere with evidence or assist his or her escape.
128
Fingerprinting is regulated by section 141 of the 1999 Act. Fingerprints may betaken from adults arriving without proof of identity, those granted temporaryentry where there is a suspicion that they may break entry conditions, illegalentrants subject to removal, a person who has been arrested about whom adecision to give leave to enter has not yet been reached, asylum seekers anddependants of the above.
129The fingerprinting of children under the age of 16
is subject to restrictions. Where there is doubt as to the age of the person,fingerprints may be taken if a senior officer (Chief Constable, ChiefImmigration Officer, Prison Governor) reasonably believes that the person is

Practice, based on the Codes issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984, must be complied with by immigration officers and those authorisedto take fingerprints. An immigration officer exercising any power conferredunder the 1971 Act or the 1999 Act may, if necessary, use reasonable force.
132
Detention centres for detained persons
Part VIII of the 1999 Act provides for arrangements for the management ofdetention centres for the accommodation of immigration and asylumdetainess, and provides for the contracting out of the provision and runningof detention centres.
Marriage regulations
Part IX of the 1999 Act tightens up the law relating to abuse of marriage forthe purposes of immigration.
133Registrars have the power to request
evidence of name, age, marital status and nationality from couples, and torefuse to give authority for the marriage where the Registrar is not satisfiedthat a person is free, legally, to contract the marriage. The existing procedurefor authorising marriage by a certificate with a licence is abolished, and theexisting period of notice for the Superintendent Registrar to issue a certificatewithout a licence reduced from 21 to 15 days. The law is amended to ensurethat notice of intent to marry is given personally by each party before theSuperintendent Registrar in the registration district where they reside, and thenotice will have to state their nationality. Under section 24, Registrars areunder a duty to report to the Home Office those marriages suspected ofhaving been arranged for the purpose of evading immigration controls. 
Judicial review and immigration
Immigration raises difficult questions for the courts, particularly in light of thewide powers conferred on the Home Secretary. Exercise of the HomeSecretary’s powers which resulted in judicial criticism occurred in M v Home
Office (1992). The Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, had ignored an order of the
court that M should not be returned to Zaire, where he feared torture.Immigration officials put M on a plane, which the Home Secretary refused tohave turned back. The House of Lords held that an injunction could lie againstministers of the Crown, and that they would be guilty of contempt of court –in their official capacity – for defiance of orders of the court.Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
Where the Home Secretary has rejected an application for asylum, and the
applicant submits a fresh application based on ‘new, apparently credible
evidence’, the Home Secretary has a duty to consider that application afresh :
R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Boybeyi (1997). The Court
of Appeal so held, dismissing the Home Secretary’s appeal against thejudgment of the lower court in judicial review proceedings. An unsuccessfulapplication for asylum does not preclude the making of a second application,based on fresh evidence.
134However, where no fresh application is
submitted, there is no right of appeal against the Home Secretary’s decision todeny asylum: R v Special Adjudicator ex parte Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment (1997).
135
The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
In R v Home Secretary ex parte Bugdaycay and Musisi (1987), the House of Lords
took a more robust approach. In judicial review proceedings, the House ofLords ruled that the Home Secretary had failed to take into account relevantconsiderations in his decision to deport a Ugandan refugee to Kenya (in whichthe applicant had lived previously). Evidence existed that Kenya hadpreviously returned refugees to Uganda. The court had the aid of theConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1954, Article 33 of whichprovides that no one should be returned to a territory where his life orfreedom would be threatened, which the court boldly held should govern theinterpretation of the Immigration Rules. 
Under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,
136which came
into force in 1954, the United Kingdom has undertaken certain obligations.The United Nations’ Office of High Commissioner for Refugees is theumbrella office responsible for providing advice and guidance as to theinterpretation and implementation of the Convention. A person is definedunder the Convention as a refugee if he:
(a) is outside the country of his nationality;
(b) has a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinions;
and
(c) is unable or, because of that fear, unwilling to avail himself of the
protection of that country.137
If a person is found to be a refugee, that person is entitled not to be expelled or
returned to the country from which he fears persecution. If, however, the

State for the Home Department ex parte Salem (1998).
136 See UK Treaty Series No 39, Cmnd 9171, 1954, London: HMSO. The Convention was
amended in 1966 by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
137 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 1A(2).

person has come to the United Kingdom from a third country, he may be
returned to that third country, provided that that third country will not returnhim to the country from which he has fled.
138In Gardi v Secretary of State for
the Home Department (2002), the Court of Appeal ruled that ethnic Kurds who
had a safe and autonomous region to return to (the Kurdish AutonomousRegion in Iraq), and an undertaking by the Home Secretary that the claimantwould not be removed from the United Kingdom until a supervised and safemethod of travel could be arranged, did not establish refugee status.
If a person is deemed to be a refugee, and has not come from a safe third
country, he is entitled to remain. However, he may be deported on the basis ofthe requirements of national security or public order, although only if somecountry in which he would be safe will accept him.
139
A person is not a refugee for the purpose of the Convention on the sole
ground that he or she is stateless, being unable to return to the country inwhich he or she is habitually resident. To bring an person within theConvention, it must be established that there is a well founded fear ofpersecution on Convention grounds.
140
The test for deciding whether a person has a well founded fear is both
subjective and objective. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex
parte Sivakumaran (1988), the House of Lords ruled that, whilst the fear is
subjective, the reasonableness of that fear is an objective test. Moreover, theHouse of Lords ruled that the test was one to be applied by the HomeSecretary. If the Home Secretary decides that there is a ‘reasonable chance’, a‘serious possibility’ or ‘substantial grounds for thinking’ that the person willbe persecuted, the objective test will be satisfied. 
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Gashi (Besnik)
(1999), the Secretary of State made an order to return the applicant toGermany, which he had previously been required to leave, having fled therefrom Kosovo. The applicant sought to challenge the decision to remove himon the basis that Germany was not a safe third country, alleging that theGerman courts were returning ethnic Albanians to Kosovo. The Queen’sBench Division ruled, however, that the German courts respected thedemands of the Convention, and that the Secretary of State had taken allreasonable and necessary steps to remain abreast of the German courts’approach. Accordingly, his decision was not unlawful because ofunreasonableness. The Court of Appeal, however, allowed the applicant’sappeal. The Home Secretary was not entitled to assume that Germanyproperly applied the Refugee Convention, and evidence suggested disparitiesin treatment between asylum seekers which the Home Secretary had a duty toChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

investigate. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Lul Omar
Adan, Sittampalan Subaskaran and Hamid Aitsegeur (1999), the Court of Appeal
also found that the interpretation of the Convention in Germany and France,
in relation to refugees from Somalia, Sri Lanka and Algeria respectively, wasinconsistent with the requirements of the Convention, and that neithercountry applied the Convention in their approach to persecution by non-stateagents.
141
In determining whether a person is suffering a well founded fear of
persecution, past persecution is relevant for the purposes of determining aperson’s refugee status. It is a question of fact and degree whether a singlebeating amounts to persecution and, in that determination, a court or tribunalshould consider not only the seriousness of the beating but also the risk ofrepetition if that person was returned to his or her country of origin.
142A
person does not forfeit the right to the protection of the Convention on theStatus of Refugees even where an asylum seeker had in bad faith and for thesole purpose of obtaining refugee status acted in such a manner in thiscountry as to put himself at risk of persecution in his country of origin. Whilehis claim would need careful scrutiny and his credibility would be low,nevertheless, he would still be entitled to protection in this country if he couldestablish a genuine and well founded fear of persecution if returned to hishome country.
143Moreover, it did not follow that an asylum seeker must be
refused asylum because the asylum seeker, albeit unreasonably, wouldengage in certain political or religious activities on his return which would puthim or her at greater risk. The Court of Appeal insisted that a single questionarose in all asylum cases, namely, ‘was there a serious risk that on return theapplicant would be persecuted ...’.
144The adequacy of the protection which
state authorities would provide for a person if returned to his or her country,from the activities of third parties who posed a risk to a person or group, isalso a relevant consideration in determining whether a person should begranted asylum. Where the state was unwilling or unable to protect theperson from acts of ill treatment, that factor formed part of the considerationas to whether the applicant’s fear of persecution was well founded.
145In R v
Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Shokar (1998), the Queen’s Bench Division
ruled that, where a person had suffered ill treatment at the hands of thePunjabi police, and the authorities would not tolerate police misconduct, thepolice could not be termed agents of persecution under the Convention.
In R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Another ex parte Shah; Islam and
Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1997), the House of Lords

determine the credibility of any fresh evidence adduced by an applicant for asylum in R

ruled on the meaning of ‘membership of a particular social group’, within
Article 1A of the Geneva Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status ofRefugees,
146for the purposes of refugee status. The appellants were two
Pakistani women, who had been accused of adultery and disobedience totheir husbands, and who had no protection from their families and facedpersecution under Sharia law, and possibly death by stoning, if returned toPakistan. The Court of Appeal ruled that they were not members of a‘particular social group’ for asylum purposes under the Convention.‘Membership, etc’ meant that ‘members of the group had to share a commonuniting attribute which set them apart from the rest of society, which wasrecognised as such by society generally, and which existed independently ofthe feared persecution’, and that women did not form such a group. TheHouse of Lords, however, ruled that the fact that some women in Pakistanescaped the effects of systematic discrimination was not sufficient ground todeny Convention protection to particular women. Women in Pakistan were asocial group in that ‘society discriminated on the basis of sex’ and were not‘entitled to the same fundamental rights as men’.
147
In Ouanes v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1997),the Court of
Appeal also considered the characteristics defining social groups for asylum.The characteristic ‘which defined the social group had to be one which themembers should not be required to change because it was so fundamental totheir individual identities or conscience’. Shared identities by virtue ofemployment did not constitute the requisite characteristics for asylumpurposes within the Convention. The application for review by a member of agroup of Algerian government employed midwives was rejected. See, also,Jain v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2000),in which the Court of
Appeal ruled that although homosexuals did constitute a social group, thelikelihood of persecution had not been made out. Although homosexualpractices were criminal in India, the law was seldom enforced.
In Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Noor v Same; Lazarevic v
Same; Radivojevic v Same (1997),the Court of Appeal was called upon,  for the
first time in 46 years, to consider the definition of ‘refugee’ in Article 1A(2) ofthe Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 and1967.
148
Under Article 1A(2) of the Convention, an asylum seeker unable to return
to his country of origin might be entitled to recognition as a refugee providedonly that the fear or actuality of past persecution still played a causative partin his presence in the United Kingdom. In the case of each applicant, theImmigration Appeal Tribunal decided, in 1996, that the asylum seeker wasnot entitled to refugee status. The Court of Appeal considered that what wasChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

147 See, also, R (Ivanauskiene) v Special Adjudicator (2001).
148 Cmd 9171, 1951, London: HMSO; and Cmnd 3906, 1967, London: HMSO, respectively.

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
in issue was whether it was always necessary for a person unable to return to
his country of origin to show a current well founded fear of persecution, orwhether a historical fear might sometimes suffice. The Home Secretary arguedthat there must be a currently well founded fear of persecution.
149
Under Article 1A(2), a refugee was someone who:
1 (a) owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for [a Convention
reason] was outside the country of his nationality, and (b)(i) was unable to
avail himself of the protection of that country, or (ii) owing to such fear,was unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who
2 (a) not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former
habitual residence, (b)(i) was unable to return to it, or (ii) owing to a wellfounded fear of being persecuted for [a Convention reason] was unwillingto return to it.
Lord Justice Simon Brown ruled that that Article was capable of three
meanings, namely that the applicant: (a) was outside owing to a well foundedfear of persecution still current at the time of the asylum application; or (b) hasat some time, however long in the past, come to be outside on account of suchfear and, for whatever reason, had ever thereafter left; or (c) had come to beoutside or, being already outside, not to return, owing to past persecution andstill remained abroad on that account, in the sense that the causal linkremained operative and had never been broken. It was the latter interpretationwhich was to be preferred.
However, the House of Lords, in a unanimous decision on appeal from the
Court of appeal, tightened the interpretation of ‘refugee’. In Adan v Secretary of
State for the Home Department (1998), the House of Lords ruled that it was
insufficient for an asylum seeker to ground his or her claim to asylum onpotential persecution if returned to his or her home country, unless that claimcould demonstrate that that person would be specifically discriminatedagainst. Accordingly, where the applicant claimed that he or she would bepersecuted because of membership of a particular group involved in a civilwar – in this case in Somalia – the applicant was not to be accorded refugeestatus. Unless the applicant could prove that he or she was in particulardanger, over and above that of others in society, the claim would fail. In thiscase, every person claiming refugee status had to demonstrate a ‘well foundedfear of persecution, above the risk to life and liberty involved in being caughtin a civil war’. Additionally, the House of Lords ruled, the fear of persecutionmust exist at the time they apply for asylum – a fear founded on the time atwhich they left the country was not sufficient.
150
In reaching decisions as to whether to return an asylum seeker to a third
country, the Home Secretary has to be satisfied that the third country presentsno risk which would breach international obligations, namely, that the thirdcountry would not send the detainee to another country, other than in
783149 See Fadli v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2000).
150 See, also, Omoruyi v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2000).

accordance with the Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of
Refugees 1951 and 1967.151
R v Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another ex parte Canbolat
(1997) involved an application for judicial review of the decisions of the HomeSecretary to issue a certificate under section 2 of the 1996 Act, authorising theapplicant’s removal from the United Kingdom to France as a safe country forthe purposes of adjudication of her claim for asylum, and of the immigrationofficer refusing her leave to enter and removing her from the United Kingdomto France. The Home Secretary had made enquiries concerning French lawsand procedures, and had satisfied himself that the government of Francewould not send the applicant to another country other than in accordancewith the Convention. It was not for the court, in an application for judicialreview, to assess the merits of the case, but to determine whether the HomeSecretary was entitled to come to the opinion he did. Only if the HomeSecretary had reached a decision to which he could not properly have come,on the material before him, could the court interfere. The appeal wasdismissed.
152
The House of Lords considered the meaning of ‘particular social group’ in
Islam v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1999). The asylum applicants,
who were citizens of Pakistan and had suffered violence there as a result ofallegations of adultery, sought asylum on the basis that, if they returned toPakistan, they would suffer persecution and would be unprotected by theauthorities, and might be liable to death by stoning. They argued that theirreturn would be contrary to the Convention, and that the persecution theywould suffer would be ‘for reasons of membership of a particular socialgroup’. The House of Lords held that a particular social group had to existindependently of the Convention. Women in Pakistan constituted a particularsocial group because they were discriminated against as a group and the stategave them no protection. 
In Kriba v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1998) ,it was held that,
where an asylum applicant had relied on a letter from Amnesty Internationalbased on an Algerian newspaper report, and that evidence was unchallengedand uncontradicted, came from an apparently responsible source and was avital element in the applicant’s case, it was procedurally unfair to reject theevidence without giving the applicant the chance to adduce support for it.
National security and the public interest

an aeroplane, Dr Soblen cut his wrists, and was landed in London for hospital
treatment. The Home Secretary issued a deportation order on the basis thathis continued presence was ‘not conducive to the public good’. When DrSoblen applied for habeas corpus, the Court of Appeal ruled that Dr Soblenhad no right to make representations, and that deportation was anadministrative matter for the Home Secretary.
153
InR v Home Secretary ex parte Hosenball (1977), two American journalists,
Philip Agee and Mark Hosenball, were detained with a view to deportation,on the basis that their work involved obtaining and publishing informationprejudicial to national security. There was no appeal against the HomeSecretary’s decision where national security was pleaded.
154Instead, there
was a right of a hearing before a panel of three advisers to the HomeSecretary. When Hosenball tried to challenge the Home Secretary’s decision inthe courts, the Court of Appeal upheld the deportation order. Whilerecognising that the rules of natural justice
155had not been complied with in
the decision to deport Hosenball, the Court of Appeal nevertheless ruled thatthe requirements of national security prevailed and that, in matters of nationalsecurity, the Home Secretary was responsible to parliament, and not to thecourts. 
In Rehman v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1999), the Special
Immigration Appeals Commission considered the Secretary of State’s decisionto refuse an application for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdomon the basis that the applicant represented a threat to national security, in thathe was allegedly involved in an Islamic terrorist organisation. The applicantappealed against notice of intention to make a deportation order.
156The
Commission allowed his appeal. The Commission ruled that its jurisdictionwas not restricted to reviewing the Secretary of State’s decision on grounds ofWednesbury unreasonableness, but rather had a duty to decide all matters of
law and fact raised by an appeal. The definition of national security was a‘matter of fact’ to be decided by the Commission, which was entitled tosubstitute its own view for that of the Secretary of State. National securityshould be construed narrowly. A person offending against national securitywas one who engaged in, promoted or encouraged violent activity targeted atthe United Kingdom, its system of government, or its people. A person alsooffended against national security if he engaged in activity directed at thedestabilisation or overthrow of a foreign government which was likely to takereprisals against the United Kingdom affecting its security or that of itsnationals. The Secretary of State had not established that the applicant was orwas likely to be a threat to national security.

The case of R v Home Secretary ex parte Cheblak (1991) also reveals the
extensive powers of the Home Secretary to detain persons ‘in the interests of
national security’. During the Gulf War, 160 Iraqi and Palestinian citizenswere detained with a view to deportation, on the basis that their presence wasnot ‘conducive to the public good’. Abbas Cheblak and his family had beenresident in the United Kingdom for 16 years. In an application for habeascorpus, the Court of Appeal accepted the Home Secretary’s explanation thatCheblak had associations with an unspecified organisation which supportedthe Iraqi government, and refused to press the Home Secretary for furtherinformation.

Section 65 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides for appeals to anadjudicator, or to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, againstdecisions relating to a person’s entitlement under the Immigration Acts toenter or remain in the United Kingdom, where the decisions are tainted byracial discrimination
158or are unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights
Act 1998.159
Judicial review and the Human Rights Act
It has been seen above that hitherto the courts have exercised caution whenreviewing the wide powers of the Home Secretary in relation to immigrationand asylum, and that in judicial review proceedings the traditional approachof applying the strict Wednesbury criteria to executive decisions has been
taken. Accordingly, unless it could be shown that the executive’s decisionrevealed ‘irrationality, illegality or procedural impropriety’, the courts wouldnot impugn the decision. However, the Human Rights Act 1998 has effectedsignificant change to the conventional approach.
160
The Human Rights Act 1998 requires that the courts enforce the
Convention rights incorporated under the 1998 Act. The Act also requires newmodes of interpretation which extend far beyond the limited Wednesbury test,
and now include an evaluation as to whether in reaching decisions whichrestrict Convention rights the executive has acted in a manner which isproportionate to the objective being pursued and has only taken suchmeasures which are necessary in relation to the permitted limitations of rights,Chapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
as stipulated in Convention Articles (for example, inter alia, in the interests of
national security, public safety and public order). The impact of this new
approach is now being felt.
For example, in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Javed ;
R v same ex parte Zulfqar Ali ; R v Same ex parte Abid Ali (2001), the High Court
ruled that the court had a positive duty to give effect to Convention rights andto ensure that there was an effective remedy in cases of suspected breach ofConvention rights. The court granted an application for judicial review of theHome Secretary’s decision – inter alia – to include and retain Pakistan on the
list of designated countries as a country in which there appeared to him to beno serious risk of persecution, on the ground that that was not justified by thatcountry’s human rights record. The Home Secretary had argued that the courtwas not competent to challenge his decision, unless it could be shown that hehad acted in bad faith. The court rejected that contention. Since the enactmentof the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts must now to give effect toConvention rights, in particular here Article 3, the prohibition against torture,inhuman or degrading treatment. The decision to include Pakistan was, on theevidence, plainly wrong. There was the clearest evidence that two of theapplicants had been tortured in Pakistan in the past and if returned toPakistan would be likely again to be the subject of torture amounting topersecution. In the case of the third applicant, it was clear that the state hadbeen unable or unwilling to protect him from persecution by non-state agents.The Home Secretary had erred in law in the designation decision. The order ofthe special adjudicator in each case would be quashed. 
In R (Samaroo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001), the Court
of Appeal ruled that where the legitimate aim of preventing crime anddisorder could not be achieved other than by deportation, the decision makerhad to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim and the person’sfundamental rights. The applicant had alleged that deportation violated hisright to family life under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court hereconsidered the concept of proportionality and stated that the test had to beapplied in two distinct stages. The first was whether the objectives soughtcould be achieved by means which interfered less with an individual’s rights.The second stage involved consideration of whether the measure employedhad an excessive or disproportionate effect on the interests of the affectedperson. In this case, the applicant had been convicted for trafficking class Adrugs. The Home Secretary was entitled to regard that as very serious. Theapplicant’s challenge was dismissed.
Further unsuccessful challenges have invoked the Human Rights Act. In R
(X) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001)
,the Court of Appeal
ruled that the Home Secretary had the power to remove an immigrant whoseapplication for leave to remain in the United Kingdom had been refused. Thispower was exercisable even though the applicant was detained under theMental Health Act 1983 (as a paranoid schizophrenic), and the Home
787

Secretary could not remove him from the hospital under the Mental Health
Act 1983 without the approval of a mental health review tribunal. In addition,the refusal of the immigrant’s application for exceptional leave to remain inthe United Kingdom and his order for removal did not violate Article 3 of theConvention.
161The right to family life, Article 8, was held not to be violated
by the discriminatory treatment of mothers and fathers in relation tonationality in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Montana
(2000). The Court of Appeal ruled that nationality laws were valid under theConvention on Human Rights. No significant advantages would accrue fromconferring British nationality, therefore there was no interference with theright to family life. Having decided that the Secretary of State’s decision waswithin the ambit of Article 8, there was no need for the court to consider theallegation of a violation of Article 14 (the prohibition against discrimination inthe enjoyment of Convention rights).
The proportionality of deportation as a punishment was considered in B v
Secretary of State for the Home Department (Deportation: Proportionality) (2000). B,
an Italian national, had lived most of his life in the United Kingdom. He wasconvicted for abuse and the Secretary of State made a deportation order. TheCourt of Appeal ruled that the power to deport on the ground of public policyhad to be balanced against B’s right of free movement as an EU national andhis right to family life under Article 8. In this case, the Secretary of State’sdecision was unlawful. 
The right to liberty protected under Article 5 was considered in the Court
of Appeal in R (Saadi and Others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
(2001). The court ruled that the policy of the Home Secretary to detain certainasylum seekers at a reception centre for up to ten days to enable the speedydetermination of their asylum claim was lawful. The court recognised theadministrative problems caused by the escalating number of asylumapplications (the average number of applications per month from July toSeptember 2001 was nearly 7,000) and that there was a need for a fast-trackprocedure to ensure speedy and efficient processing of applications. Thedetention of an applicant pending a decision to give or refuse leave to enter orthe grant of temporary admission was authorised under the Immigration Act1971. The statutory authority had implied limitations. The detention centrewas provided for the purpose of speedily determining the application ofasylum seekers, limited to a period of up to ten days. There was a severerestriction on the liberty of claimants who had to be present at all times at thecentre. However, although it was not a decision which the court had easilyreached, it was impossible ‘to condemn as irrational’ a policy which facilitatedthe speedy determination of claims. The court ruled that in binding itself toChapter 22: Constitutional and Administrative Law
788161 See, also, R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Turgut (2001); R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Cardoso (2000); R v Secretary of State for
the Home Department ex parte Kudaisi (2000).

Citizenship, Immigration and Extradition
the Convention, states were not committing themselves to grant to aliens a
licence to enter their territories and to enjoy liberty within them. The Court ofHuman Rights had determined that the right to detain aliens carried thelimitation that detention should not be unduly prolonged. The issue ofproportionality arose and in this case there was no disproportionality.
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
As will be seen in Chapter 23, the attacks in the United States on 11 September2001 prompted the speedy passage of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and SecurityAct 2001. In relation to immigration, the 2001 Act extends the law in order thatsuspected international terrorists may be detained, when certified by theSecretary of State as threats to national security, and where their removal isnot possible at the present time.
162Such detention is subject to independent
review by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.163The Act also aims
to expedite the asylum process in relation to suspected terrorists. Where theSecretary of State certifies that a person’s removal would be conducive to thepublic good, no substantive consideration of the claim to asylum will bemade. The Act prevents judicial review of decisions of the SpecialImmigration Appeals Commission, and makes the Commission a superiorcourt of record. Appeals on a point of law lie from the Commission to theCourt of Appeal.
In order to reduce the possibility of suspected terrorists creating multiple
identities, the Act allows for the retention, for ten years, of fingerprints takenin asylum and immigration cases.
789162 Note that the 2001 Act is incompatible with Article 5(1) of the Convention and that a
derogation order (SI 4032/2001) was made – see, further, Chapter 19.
163 The detention provisions will cease to have effect on 10 November 2006.



CHAPTER 23
INTRODUCTION
The security of the state is of the utmost importance to the integrity and well
being of a nation and to individual citizens whose rights and freedoms areprotected by the security of the state. On the other hand, the rights of citizensmay be adversely affected by the exercise of such powers and there exists thepotential for governments to hide behind the doctrine of national security inorder to prevent scrutiny of executive action. Two principal constitutionalquestions arise from state security. The first concerns the extent to whicharrangements secure some form of balance between the competing needs ofstate security and protection of the individual. The second issue relates to themanner in which – and extent to which – the government is held accountablefor powers exercised in the name of state security, either through supervisionof the courts or through the democratic process.
Legal regulation of state security matters is relatively recent. Although the
original Official Secrets Act dates from 1911, it has only been in the past twodecades that statute has regulated the interception of communications,
2and the
security and intelligence services, MI5 and SIS (or MI6), and the government'ssignals intelligence organisation, Government Communications Headquarters(GCHQ). Incorporation of Convention rights under the Human Rights Act 1998necessitated further clarity in the law, provided by the Regulation ofInvestigatory Powers Act 2000, the main purpose of which is to ensure thatrelevant investigatory powers are used in accordance with human rights.
The terrorist bombings in the United States of America in September 2001
ushered in unprecedented international co-operation to combat terrorism. InBritain, the government reacted swiftly to introduce tighter anti-terrorismlaws. The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which became law inDecember 2001, was a reaction to the attacks.
THE SECURITY SERVICES
The terminology
The United Kingdom’s internal Security Service is known as MI5 (MI stands
for Military Intelligence). The Security Service dealing with matters overseas is

the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6. The government’s signals intelligence
gathering headquarters is Government Communications Headquarters, orGCHQ. Special Branch is part of the police forces and has special duties inrelation to public order, the gathering of intelligence and combatingsubversion and terrorism. The operations of MI5 and MI6 are co-ordinated bythe Intelligence Co-ordinator, based in the Cabinet Office. In addition, there isthe armed forces wing of military intelligence which, nowadays, is operativeprincipally, but not exclusively, in Northern Ireland. 
The Security Service (MI5)
Until 1989, the internal Security Service, MI5, was unknown to law.3It was
not regulated by statute and the Service did not enjoy any special commonlaw powers. MI5 was established in 1909,
4under the royal prerogative as part
of the defence forces of the realm. The Service is headed by a Director Generalwho is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Home Office. The Service isnot, however, formally a part of the Home Office and thus occupies a curiousconstitutional status. The Director General has access to the Prime Minister onmatters of importance. The Service employs some 2,000 personnel. Since theending of the Cold War, approximately 70 per cent of the Service’s resourcesare devoted to gathering intelligence about terrorism.
5Moreover, the Security
Services Act 1996 now extends the role of the Service in relation toinvestigations relating to ‘serious crime’, particularly the drugs trade. 
Functions of the Service
In 1952, the then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, issued a directive
to the Director General outlining the functions of the Service:
The Security Service is part of the defence forces of the country. Its task is the
defence of the Realm as a whole, from external and internal dangers arisingfrom attempts at espionage and sabotage, or from actions of persons andorganisations whether directed from within or without the country, whichmay be judged to be subversive of the state.
6Chapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law
7923 See, now, the Security Services Act 1989; Intelligence Services Act 1994; and Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
4 As part of the War Office. The Service was originally known as MO5.
5 The Home Secretary revealed in July 1998 that M15 currently holds approximately
440,000 files, but that only 13,000 are ‘active’ dossiers on British citizens, over half of
which were suspected of terrorist activities. Of the remainder, 35,000 files related to theService’s administration; 40,000 related to subjects and organisations studied by MI5;290,000 files related to individuals who had been subject a Service inquiry in the past 90years. A further 230,000 files were ‘closed’. Active files included about 20,000, of whichone-third related to foreign nationals: Hansard , HC Vol 317 Col 251.
6 Reproduced in Lord Denning MR’s judgment in R v Home Secretary ex parte Hosenball
(1977).

State Security
The Profumo affair7
In 1963, the Secretary of State for War, the Rt Hon John Profumo resigned from
office as a result of his lying to the House of Commons over press disclosuresconcerning an alleged affair with Christine Keeler, who had associations with aRussian Naval Attaché. The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, appointedLord Denning to inquire into the security aspects of the affair. In his report,Lord Denning stressed that the function of the Security Service:
... is to defend the Realm from dangers which would threaten it as a whole,
such as espionage on behalf of a foreign power, or internal organisationssubversive of the state. For this purpose it must collect information aboutindividuals and give it to those concerned. But it must not, even at the behestof a Minister or a government department, take part in investigating theprivate lives of individuals except in a matter bearing on the defence of theRealm as a whole.
8
Further judicial expression of the role of the Service is found in the judgment
of Taylor J in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Ruddock
(1987).
The function of the Security Service is the defence of the realm as a whole
from, inter alia , the actions of persons who and organisations which may be
subversive of the state ... A warrant to intercept should only issue where thereis reasonable cause to believe that major subversive activity is already beingcarried on and is likely to injure the national interest. The material reasonablylikely to be obtained by the interception must be of direct use to the SecurityService in its functions ...
Normal methods of investigation must either have failed or be unlikely to
succeed. Interception must be strictly limited to what is necessary to theSecurity Service’s defined functions and must not be used for party politicalpurposes ...
Despite such strictures, there have been many charges made against the
Service from journalists and from members of the Service themselves.9
Spycatcher10
The most celebrated exposure of the Service came in the form of PeterWright’s book, Spycatcher (1987). Among many allegations made by Wright in
Spycatcher was the claim that MI5 had ‘bugged and burgled its way across
London’ without lawful authority.
As an electrical engineer with MI5, Peter Wright’s expertise included
bugging embassies, diplomatic residences and international conferences. In
7937 See Denning, 1980, Chapter 3.
8 The Report on the Security Aspects of the Circumstances leading up to the Resignation of Mr
JD Profumo , Cmnd 2152, 1963, London: HMSO, caused disquiet. One outcome was the
establishment of the Security Commission in 1964. See Leigh and Lustgarten, 1991.
9 See, inter alia, Pincher, 1981; West, 1983a.
10 See Watt, 1988; Pannick, ‘ Spycatcher : two years of legal indignation’, in Kingsford-Smith
and Oliver, 1990.

1963, Wright was promoted to an interrogator and to the post of Chairman of
an internal committee inquiring into Soviet infiltration of the SecurityServices. Wright believed that MI5’s perceived poor performance in the ColdWar years of the 1950s and 1960s was in part due to Soviet infiltration at thehighest point of the Security Service. The defections of two security agents,Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, in 1951, and the confession and defectionof Kim Philby, in 1963,
11gave added weight to the security fears. Wright was
further convinced that the then head of MI5, Roger Hollis, was a Soviet agent:a matter officially denied.
12The revelation in 1979 that Anthony Blunt,
surveyor of the Queen’s art collection and knight of the realm, had been aKGB
13spy since his recruitment by the Russians whilst a student at
Cambridge University14revealed the extent to which the Security Services
had become vulnerable to Russian infiltration.
Wright became convinced that Harold Wilson, leader of the Labour Party
and Prime Minister 1964–70 and 1974–76, was planted by the KGB, whichWright claimed had poisoned the former Labour Party leader HughGaitskell.
15Wright claimed that MI5 viewed the Labour Party’s electoral
victory of 1974 as against the national interest and instigated a plot to feedanti-Labour Party information from MI5 files to pro-Conservativenewspapers.
16In 1976, Wright retired and Lord Rothschild introduced him to
the journalist Chapman Pincher. In collaboration with Pincher, Spycatcher was
written, a book which launched one of the most farcical chapters in recentlegal and political history, revealing as much about the secrecy of governmentas about the working of the Security Service. 
The government, intent on stopping circulation of Spycatcher , sought an
injunction to restrain publication.
17The basis for the injunction was an alleged
breach of confidence by Wright. Breach of confidence had been employed inAttorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976), in the attempt to prevent
publication of Richard Crossman’s Diaries.
18As was seen there, the court
accepted that revelations of Cabinet discussions could be restrained by anaction for breach of confidence but, when weighed against the public interestin freedom of information, the action failed. Chapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

1968; Philby, 1968.
12 See Pincher, 1981. Pincher relied heavily on information obtained from Wright. An
official inquiry chaired by Lord Trend in 1974–75 failed to establish Hollis’s innocence.
See HC Deb Vol 1 Cols 1079–85, 26 March 1981. Hollis retired from MI5 in 1965. TheSecurity Commission investigated the charges: its report was never published. Instead,a government statement was issued outlining measures taken as a result of the report:see Cmnd 8450, 1982, London: HMSO.

State Security
In Spycatcher, Wright alleged that the Service had, over the years, in
addition to ‘bugging and burglary’, interrogated and hounded hundreds of
individuals in an inquiry into the membership of the Communist Partyrivalling that of the McCarthy Inquiry in the United States of America in the1930s. The allegations made by Wright became a matter of intense politicaland legal interest. 
The litigation against Spycatcher commenced in Australia in 1985, and
ultimately failed.
19In 1986, both The Guardian and The Observer newspapers
carried reports of the pending hearing and reproduced some of the Spycatcher
material. Temporary injunctions were obtained by the Attorney General. Thefollowing month, The Sunday Times began serialisation of Spycatcher against
which a further injunction was granted. In 1987, the book was published inthe United States of America. The House of Lords, however, decided that theinjunctions against the press should be continued.
20The matter returned to
the courts for consideration of whether permanent injunctions against thepublication of Spycatcher should be granted. The House of Lords held that the
wide availability of the information and the public interest in freedom ofspeech and the right to receive information outweighed the interests of theCrown in preserving government secrecy.
21Nonetheless, by this time, there
had been suppression of the information for some four years.22The issue of
the temporary injunctions was taken to the European Court of Human Rights,wherein it was held that the injunctions granted violated Article 10 of theConvention: The Observer, The Guardian and The Sunday Times v United Kingdom
(1991).
23
One outcome of the Spycatcher affair was the enactment of the Security
Services Act 1989, which placed the Security Service on a statutory basis. TheRegulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 reforms the law relating to thesecurity services and the interception of communications. 
The Security Services Act 198924
The Act defines the functions of the Service and places the issuing of warrantsunder statutory authority. The Act also provided, for the first time, acomplaints procedure for individuals who are aggrieved by actions of the

23 See, further, Chapter 19; and see Leigh, 1992. In Attorney General v Blake (1996), Sir
Richard Scott VC ruled that the Crown was not entitled to the profits gained by Blake, a
former Secret Intelligence Officer who became a Soviet Agent in 1951 through thepublication of his autobiography. By 1989, when the autobiography was published,none of the information was any longer confidential and, therefore, there was no breachof the lifelong duty imposed on former security service officers not to discloseconfidential information. Furthermore, it was ruled that to grant relief would entail aninfringement of Blake’s rights under ECHR, Article 10.
24 See Leigh and Lustgarten, 1989. 

Security Service and a Commissioner charged with the task of reviewing the
procedure by which the Home Secretary issues warrants. Section 1 defines thefunctions of the Service as being: 
(2) ... the protection of national security and, in particular, its protection
against threats from espionage, terrorism and sabotage, from the activities
of agents of foreign powers and from actions intended to overthrow orundermine Parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violentmeans.
(3) It shall also be the function of the Service to safeguard the economic well
being of the United Kingdom against threats posed by the actions orintentions of persons outside the British Islands.
In 1992, the Security Service assumed responsibility for terrorism related to
Northern Ireland. This had previously been under the jurisdiction of SpecialBranch. 
The Security Service itself is not defined in the Act. The Secret Intelligence
Service – M16 – did not fall under the control of the Act. Other agencies, suchas Special Branch, which carries out many of the functions of the SecurityService (see below), and GCHQ, are not mentioned in the Act.
25National
security is not defined in the Act. In debate on the Bill, the Home Secretarystated that the ‘phrase refers – and can only refer – to matters relating to thesurvival or well being of the nation as a whole, and not to party-political orsectional or lesser interests’.
26
The duties of the Director General of the Service are set out in section 2.
These are primarily the responsibility ‘for the efficiency of the Service’, and forensuring that the Service only collects information necessary for the properdischarge of its functions, and that the Service does not take any action tofurther the interests of any political party. The Director General is required toreport annually to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment, and may otherwise report to them at any time the DirectorGeneral so decides.
While the Director General is under a duty to report to the Prime Minister,
there is no duty imposed on the Prime Minister to lay that report beforeparliament. There is thus no parliamentary scrutiny of the Director General’sexercise of power. Attempts in both the House of Commons and the House ofLords to introduce such scrutiny failed. However, the Intelligence Services Act1994,
27for the first time, brings parliamentary scrutiny to the work of the
Security Services, both MI5 and MI6 – and to GCHQ. Under the Act, aParliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee is established. Asdiscussed below, the Committee is not a select committee, and is not given theChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

State Security
powers of a select committee. Furthermore, under the Act, information may
be withheld from the Committee on the basis that ‘the Secretary of State hasdetermined that it should not be disclosed’.
28
The Security Services Act 1996
The Security Services Act 1996 extends the function of the Security Serviceinto matters concerning ‘serious crime’. The government’s objective was toenable the Service to investigate ‘organised crime’ and ‘drug trafficking,money launderers and racketeers’. The Service acts in a supportive role, andthe principal responsibility lies with the conventional law enforcementagencies.
29However, ‘serious crime’ is not itself defined in the Act. Nor is the
scope of the Service’s jurisdiction entirely clear. Moreover, the Service willremain under the operation control of the Director General, and will not beaccountable to local police authorities, nor will their operations be supervisedby the Police Complaints Authority.
The Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)30
MI6 is the branch of the Security Services which deals with informationgathering and operations outside the United Kingdom. Whereas a degree ofopenness has been established concerning the work of MI5, the work of MI6remains closely guarded. It was only in 1992 that the Prime Ministeracknowledged publicly for the first time that the Service existed. It is MI6operations – together with military intelligence and the work of GCHQ –which gathers intelligence from around the world through espionage andcovert action. In times of war – whether ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ – the Service is ofinestimable value to the protection of the state against outside threats.
31MI6 is
under the control of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and requires itsapproval before launching operations. Any politically sensitive mattersrequire the personal approval of the Foreign Secretary. While, in theory, MI6is confined to operations outside the United Kingdom, and handsresponsibility over to MI5 once a matter becomes ‘internal’, there have beendoubts expressed as to whether the boundaries are, or indeed can be, soclearly drawn. 
The functions of MI6
The Intelligence Services Act 1994 defined, for the first time, the statutoryfunctions of the Service. Section 1 provides that the function of MI6 is to obtain
79728 Intelligence Services Act 1994, Sched 3, para 3(1)(b)(ii).
29 See HL Deb Cols 398–99, 14 May 1996.30 See West, 1981; Bloch and Fitzgerald, 1983.
31 It was with MI6 that Paul Henderson, Managing Director of Matrix Churchill worked
during the Iran-Iraq War – a matter which led to a judicial inquiry. See, further, Chapter
11.

and provide information relating to the actions or intentions of persons outside
the British Islands, and to perform other tasks relating to the actions orintentions of such persons. Such actions must be related to the objectives definedin the Act, namely in the interest of national security ‘with particular reference todefence and foreign policies’; the interests of the national’s economic well beingand assisting in the ‘prevention or detection of serious crime’.
32
Operations are authorised by the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, and agent’s activities are regulated by administrativeinternal rules. Where action within the British Islands is required, MI5 mayapply to the Home Secretary for a warrant to carry out operations on behalf ofMI6.
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)33
The Government’s Communication Headquarters at Cheltenham34was
established under the royal prerogative, as part of the Foreign andCommonwealth Office.
35The principal tasks of GCHQ include the security of
military and official communications and the provision of signals intelligence(SIGINT) for the government. GCHQ has an annual budget of about £500million and a staff of some 4,500 personnel, making it the largest of the threeintelligence services in the United Kingdom. 
Legal authority for the interception of international communications was
first provided under the Official Secrets Act 1920, section 4 of which providedfor the interception of ‘telegrams’ under the warrant of the Home Secretary onthe basis of the public interest. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act2000 now provides statutory authority for external warrants issued by theSecretary of State.
36No warrant may be issued for interference with
individual communications within the United Kingdom, unless theinterception is designed to uncover information relating to the prevention ordetection of terrorism.
37GCHQ co-operates in signals intelligence matters
with its counterparts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UnitedStates. 
From 1947 until 1984, employees at GCHQ were entitled to belong to
trades unions. In January 1984, the Foreign Secretary announced, withoutwarning, that this right was to be removed. GCHQ had experienceddisruption for some two years, with a loss of 10,000 working days. In 1983, aGCHQ employee, Geoffrey Prime,
38was arrested and convicted of spying forChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

the Soviet Union. Both factors – and the government’s general desire to curb
the power of trades unions – contributed to the banning of unions at GCHQ.39
The legal outcome of the exercise of the prerogative40in banning union
membership at GCHQ led to Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the
Civil Service (1984), in which the House of Lords ruled in favour of the
government on the basis of national security.41
The Intelligence Services Act 1994 placed GCHQ on a statutory basis.42
The statutory duty of the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ is to exerciseits functions ‘in the interests of national security, with particular reference tothe defence and foreign policies of Her Majesty’s government in the UnitedKingdom’.
43The Director of GCHQ is responsible for the ‘efficiency of the
agency’44and has a right of access to the Prime Minister and Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The Director is under a duty toreport annually to the Prime Minister. The monitoring of communications isregulated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, on which, seebelow. 
Special Branch45
Established in 1883 to deal with problems of security in relation to Ireland,Special Branch rapidly expanded to deal with many security matters.Originally, Special Branch was confined to the Metropolitan Police Force; from1945, other police forces established Special Branches. Nowadays, eachprovincial force has its own Special Branch. Special Branch is staffed byordinary police officers under the direction of the Chief Constable. Much oftheir work is related to Security Service matters. Other functions include juryvetting in cases involving national security or terrorism, providing personalprotection and assisting with immigration matters, including keeping watchat airports and seaports.

Military intelligence and the armed forces
In 1940, the Special Operations Executive (SOE) was formed to supplement
the work of MI5 and MI6, which were geared principally to work in peacetime. Subsequently, the need for special units to operate under militarycommand, and under cover, became perceived as imperative. Originallyknown as L Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade and, later, simply theSAS, the service was introduced on the initiative of David Stirling of the ScotsGuards, and approved by the Commander-in-Chief. Members of the SASwere recruited primarily from commandos. A parallel organisation, theSpecial Boat Service (SBS), was also established to complement the work of theSAS.
The SAS has been involved in many operations overseas, in Northern
Ireland and on the mainland, principally working against terrorism. It was,for example, in 1980, the SAS which stormed the Iranian Embassy in Londonto free hostages from terrorists who had occupied the Embassy and, asdiscussed below, it was the SAS which was dispatched to Gibraltar to arrestsuspected IRA terrorists.
The SAS is controlled at a political level and a practical, operational level.
In relation to terrorism, a special committee, known as COBRA and chaired bythe Home Secretary, meets with representatives from the Ministry of Defence,the Security Service (MI5), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and theSAS to decide the appropriate political and military response. In relation tooperational matters, a special unit within the Ministry of Defence, the JointOperations Centre (JOC), comprising the Foreign Office, Home Office,intelligence services and the SAS, activates the SAS at home or overseas.Exceptionally, the Prime Minister may personally activate the SAS, as in theIranian Embassy siege. When the SAS is operational, it exercises the powers ofthe police, although formal authority remains with the police, and the policeresume their normal functions once the operation is complete.
The Security Commission46
In 1964, following the Profumo affair ,the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-
Home announced the creation of a Security Commission. The Commissioninvestigates and reports upon the circumstances in which a breach of securityis known to have occurred in the public service, and upon any related failureof departmental security arrangements or neglect of duty; and, in the light ofany such investigation, advises whether any change in security arrangementsis desirable.

investigations of security matters in Signals and Communication Units andinto the circumstances surrounding the conviction of Geoffrey Prime forespionage.
50The Commission has power to call whomsoever it wishes as

No legal representation is allowed for witnesses before theCommission. The Commission reports, with recommendations, to the PrimeMinister. 
Lustgarten and Leigh evaluate the Commission’s success and future
development. The Commission, in their view, is useful ‘in its narrow andspecific sphere of operation’.
51The authors call for the Commission to be
placed on a statutory basis, with independent powers of investigation, for theCommission’s powers to be explicitly stated and for greater protection to bebuilt in for individuals who come before the Commission. 
THE INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS52
The government’s response to the outcome of Malone v United Kingdom (1984),
in which the absence of statutory authority for intercept warrants was held tohave violated Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights, was to pass theInterception of Communications Act 1985. The Interception ofCommunications Act 1985 made it a criminal offence to intentionally intercepta communication and provided statutory power for the Secretary of State toissue warrants ‘in the interests of national security, or for the purpose ofpreventing or detecting serious crime or for the purpose of safeguarding theeconomic well-being of the United Kingdom’. The powers of the police toconduct surveillance was given statutory force by the Police Act 1997.
Prior to the Police Act 1997, the power of the police to effect surveillance
remained obscure. In R v Khan (Sultan) (1995), the question of the admissibility

of evidence acquired as a result of bugging devices was considered by the
House of Lords. The defendant was suspected of being involved in theimportation of drugs. The police installed a listening device in a house whichKhan was visiting. The defence argued that the recording was inadmissible,there being no statutory authority for such an installation, which accordinglyamounted to a trespass to property and a violation of Article 8 of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights. The House of Lords rejected thedefence arguments. While accepting that there had been a trespass, and aninvasion of privacy, these factors were outweighed by the fact that the policehad largely complied with the Home Secretary’s Guidelines. Moreover,Convention rights, not at that time being incorporated into English law, couldnot found the basis for a defence. Accordingly, even if the evidence had beenobtained improperly, on the authority of R v Sang (1980), the evidence was
admissible. In Khan v United Kingdom (2000), on an application under the
European Convention of Human Rights alleging violations of Articles 6, 8 and13, the Court of Human Rights ruled that Articles 8 and 13, but not Article 6,had been breached.
53
Whereas the authority for police surveillance devices was formerly
uncertain, the Police Act 1997 extended the scope of surveillance. Part I of thePolice Act 1997 established a National Criminal Intelligence Service Authorityto provide criminal intelligence to other police and law enforcement agencies,and placed surveillance techniques under statutory authority.
54The Act was
modelled on the Interception of Communications Act 1985, and placed theHome Secretary’s Guidelines on a statutory basis. Authorisation may begiven, under section 93(2), for the use of surveillance devices if surveillancewill be of substantial value in the prevention and detection of serious crime,and the objective cannot reasonably be achieved by other means. Seriouscrime is defined as including crimes of violence, crimes involving financialgain and crimes involving large numbers of persons, or crimes for which aperson with no previous conviction could expect to receive a prison sentenceof three or more years. Authorisation is given by a Chief Officer of Police, oran officer of rank of Assistant Chief Constable.
55Prior authorisation by a
commissioner, appointed under section 91 of the Act, must be obtained if theproperty involved is a private dwelling, a hotel bedroom or office premises,and also where the surveillance may result in the acquisition of confidentialknowledge, or journalistic or other matters subject to legal privilege.

State Security
THE REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS ACT 2000
The provisions relating to interception of communications under the 1985 Act
are now repealed and replaced by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act2000 (RIPA), which also amends the Police Act 1997 and the IntelligenceServices Act 1994. The 2000 Act was prompted by two major concerns. Thefirst was that the 1985 Act regulated intercepts of communications transmittedvia mail and by a public telecommunications system, which at the time of thelegislation covered most data transmissions. Technological advances since1985, however, have expanded communications systems – through theinternet and email and through telecommunication systems not provided bypublic telecommunications providers. Also falling outside the 1985 Act wasdata which was ‘encrypted’ and required a ‘key’ to unlock the data. Thesecond motivation for reform was the influence of the European Conventionon Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. which, when it came intoforce in England and Wales in 2000, would make Convention rightsenforceable before the domestic courts and tribunals. As discussed in moredetail in Chapter 19, cases such as Halford v United Kingdom (1997) and Khan v
United Kingdom (2000) (discussed above) had successfully challenged domestic
law. In Halford’s case, the interception of the applicant’s telephone by a private
communications system was unlawful, given the absence of statutoryauthority for such intercepts.
57
In the Consultation Paper Interception of Communications in the United
Kingdom,58the Home Secretary stated that:
This revolution in communications technology is one of the imperatives for
change in the law. But so too is the need to protect human rights – this hasbeen uppermost in our minds in devising these proposals.
80357 Section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act proscribed the admission of
evidence acquired through intercepts under warrant into court. The purpose of this
prohibition was to prevent disclosure as to either the existence of a warrant or the factthat a warrant had been applied for (see R v Preston (1994)). However, it has been held
that evidence acquired through an interception which has been placed on a telephoneline with the consent of a customer, did not preclude the admission of that evidenceinto court ( R v Choudhary (1997)). Moreover, the prohibition on the admissibility of
evidence at trial was not to be extended to apply in the case of foreign telephoneintercepts, notwithstanding the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 and theEuropean Convention on Human Rights relating to privacy. The Court of Appeal,Criminal Division, so held in R v X, Y and Z (2000). Any alleged violation of Article 8
was not such that Article 6, the right to fair trial, was also violated. Section 9 of theInterception of Communications Act 1985 was considered by the Court of Appeal in R v
Owen and R v Stephen (1998). At issue was whether the prohibition in s 9 precluded any
investigation into whether an intercept was consensual under s 1(2), which providesthat a person shall not be guilty of an offence under s 1 if that person has reasonablegrounds to believe that the person to whom, or the person by whom, thecommunication is sent had consented to the interception. That prohibition applied, eventhough the particular circumstances of the case did not fall within the objective of the1985 Act, namely, to avoid the embarrassment in terms of confidentiality if theauthorities were challenged as to the lawfulness of their actions. 
58 Cm 4368, 1999, London: HMSO.

The Act relates to powers concerning the interception of communications,
intrusive surveillance on residential premises and in private vehicles, covertsurveillance in the course of specific operations, the use of covert humanintelligence sources (agents, informants, undercover officers), the acquisitionof communications data and access to encrypted data. The Act is intended toensure that the law clearly states the purposes for which such powers may beused, which authorities may exercise the powers, who should authorise theuse of power, the use that can be made of material gained, independentjudicial oversight of the exercise of powers and a means of redress foraggrieved individuals. The Act works in conjunction with existing legislation.The Act is in five parts: Part I dealing with interceptions of communicationsand the acquisition and disclosure of communications data. Part II deals withsurveillance and covert human intelligence sources. Part III relates to theinvestigation of electronic data protected by encryption. Part IV governs thescrutiny of investigatory powers and Codes of Practice. Part V coversmiscellaneous and supplemental matters.
The interception of communications
The Act repeals sections 1 to 10, section 11(2) to (5) and Schedule 1 of theInterception of Communications Act 1985. Section 1 creates the offences ofunlawful interception and a separate tort of unlawful interception. The offenceof unlawful interception is similar to that under section 1 of the 1985 Act,which is repealed by the 2000 Act. Unlawful interceptions relate to anycommunication in the course of its transmission by means of a public postalservice or public telecommunications system. Conduct has lawful authorityonly if it is authorised under section 3 or 4, takes place in accordance with awarrant under section 5 or, in relation to any stored communication, if it is inexercise of any statutory power, other than this section, for the purpose ofobtaining information or of taking possession of any document or otherproperty. Conduct which has lawful authority shall also be taken to be lawfulfor all other purposes. A person having the right to control the operation oruse of the system which is intercepted, or having the express or impliedconsent of such a person to make the interception, is excluded from criminalliability.
59
The circumstances in which conduct consisting of the interception,
without a warrant, of a communication is lawful are defined in sections 3 and4. Section 5 regulates interceptions under warrant. The Secretary of State mayissue a warrant authorising or requiring interceptions, but shall not issue anChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

interception warrant unless he believes that the warrant is necessary on the
grounds of the interests of national security, or for the purpose of preventingor detecting serious crime, or for the purpose of safeguarding the economicwell being of the United Kingdom, or for the purpose of preventing ordetecting serious crime by giving effect to the provisions of any internationalmutual assistance agreement. The warrant shall not be issued unless theSecretary of State also believes that the conduct authorised by the warrant isproportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct. In considering
whether the requirements are satisfied in the case of any warrant, theSecretary of State must take into account whether the information which it isthought necessary to obtain under the warrant could reasonably be obtainedby other means. The meaning of ‘safeguarding the economic well being of theUnited Kingdom’ under section 5(3)(c) must be read subject to section 5(5),which states that a warrant shall not be considered necessary unless theinformation which it is thought necessary to obtain is information relating tothe acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands. 
Warrants may only be issued on the application of specified persons,
namely, the Director General of the Security Service, the Chief of the SecretIntelligence Service, the Director of GCHQ, the Director General of theNational Criminal Intelligence Service, the Commissioner of Police of theMetropolis, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the chiefconstable of any police force under the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, theCommissioners of Customs and Excise, or a person who is the competentauthority of a country outside the United Kingdom under any internationalmutual assistance agreement. Section 7 regulates the persons who may signinterception warrants and the circumstances in which they may do so. Thewarrant must be issued under the hand of the Secretary of State or, in urgentcases where the Secretary of State has expressly authorised the issue of thewarrant and cases in which the warrant is for the purposes of a request forassistance made under an international mutual assistance agreement andeither the subject is outside the United Kingdom or the interception relates toa place outside the United Kingdom, the warrant may be issued under thehand of a senior official. The senior official who signs the warrant must beexpressly authorised by the Secretary of State to do so, which ensures that theSecretary of State must give personal consideration to the application. Thewarrant must name or describe either one person as the interception subject ora single set of premises as the premises in relation to which the interception isto take place. 
Section 8 provides for two different forms which a warrant may take.
Section 8(a) and (b) require that either the person or premises to be interceptedis named or described on the face of the warrant, and sub-section (2) providesthat the warrant must include details setting out how the interceptedcommunications are to be identified. Sub-section (3) provides for certificatedwarrants and applies if the conditions in sub-sections (3)(a) and (b) and (4)(a)
805

or (b) are met. Where a certificated warrant is required, there must be a
certificate describing the intercepted material, the examination of which theSecretary of State considers necessary for the purposes for the issue of thewarrant at the time when the Secretary of State issues the warrant, and whichmay be read, looked at or listened to by any other person. Any otherintercepted material, though lawfully intercepted, may be so examined.
A warrant issued by a senior officer ceases to have effect at the end of the
fifth working day following the day of the warrant’s issue, but is renewable. Awarrant renewed under the signature of the Secretary of State has effect for sixmonths. Under section 11, a warrant may be implemented by the person towhom it is addressed or by that person through or with such other persons ashe may require to give assistance with giving effect to the warrant. A personrequired to give assistance under the section 11, who knowingly fails tocomply with his or her duty, is guilty of an offence.
60
Section 15 controls the dissemination of intercepted material and is
intended to minimise its disclosure. It is the duty of the Secretary of State toensure that the number of persons to whom the material may be disclosedand the extent to which material may be disclosed or copied is limited to theminimum that is necessary for the authorised purposes. In relation tocertificated warrants issued under section 8(3) (which require a certificatecertifying the description of intercepted material which the Secretary of Stateconsiders necessary for the purposes of the warrant), section 15 provides thatsuch material so described may be read or looked at by any person, but thatno other intercepted material, though lawfully intercepted, may be examined.The material authorised for examination is accordingly subject to ministerialcontrol. 
Section 16 provides additional safeguards in relation to the disclosure of
information obtained under a section 8(1) warrant which identifies thematerial to be examined but does not identify the name or premises which aresubject to the intercept. Section 17 prevents the disclosure of specified
61
information relating to intercepts in any legal proceedings. Exceptions to thisprohibition are provided by section 18.
Investigation of electronic data protected by encryption
Part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act provides for theinterception of data protected by encryption. The Home Secretary,commenting on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, stated that it:

Where protected information – defined as electronic data which, without the
key to the data, cannot or cannot readily be accessed or cannot readily be putinto an intelligible form’
63– comes into the possession of ‘any person’ with
statutory power to seize, detain, inspect, search or otherwise interfere withdocuments or property, or through the exercise of authorised interceptionpowers in respect of national security matters, or through disclosure orthrough ‘any other lawful means not involving the exercise of statutorypowers’ by the intelligence services, police or customs or excise, and it isnecessary to decode the data through means of a key, a notice of requirementto disclose the key may be issued. The requirement to disclose a key may bemade in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing ordetecting crime or in the interests of the economic well being of the UnitedKingdom.
64The Secretary of State is under a duty to ensure that
arrangements are in force for requiring or authorising the section 49 notices.65
Schedule 2 regulates authorisations. In relation to protected information, inEngland and Wales, written permission for the giving of section 49 notices,requiring the disclosure of a key, must be given by a circuit judge, in Scotland,a sheriff and, in Northern Ireland, a county court judge. The authorised noticemust be in writing or in such a manner that produces a record of its havingbeen given; describe the protected information to which the notice relates;specify the ground on which the information is required; specify the office,rank or position of the person giving the notice; specify the office, rank orposition of the person who granted permission for the giving of the notice;specify the time by which the notice is to be complied with and must set outthe disclosure that is required and the form and manner in which it is to bemade.

The number ofpersons to whom the key is disclosed or made available must be limited to theminimum necessary for enabling protected information to be put intointelligible form.
Authorisation of surveillance and human intelligence sources
Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 provides a statutorybasis for the authorisation and use by the security and intelligence agencies,law enforcement and other public authorities, of covert surveillance, agents,informants and undercover officers. It is intended to regulate the use of suchtechniques and ‘safeguard the public from unnecessary invasions of theirprivacy’. Section 26 defines the conduct regulated under Part II, and applies todirected surveillance, intrusive surveillance and the conduct and use of coverthuman intelligence sources. Surveillance is ‘directed’ if it is covert but notintrusive and is undertaken:
(a) for the purposes of a specific investigation or a specific operation;(b) in such a manner as is likely to result in the obtaining of private
information about a person (whether or not one specifically identified for
the purposes of the investigation or operation); and
(c) otherwise than by way of an immediate response to events or
circumstances the nature of which is such that it would not be reasonablypracticable for an authorisation under this Part to be sought for thecarrying out of the surveillance.
Surveillance is ‘intrusive’ if it is surveillance that either:
(a) involves the presence of an individual, or of any surveillance device, on
any residential premises or in any private vehicle; or
(b) is carried out in relation to anything taking place on residential premises
or in a private vehicle by means of any surveillance device that is not
present on the premises or in the vehicle.
Surveillance is not intrusive if it is carried out by means of a device designedor adapted principally for the purposes of providing information about thelocation of a vehicle, or if it is surveillance consisting of any such interceptionChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

of a communication. Surveillance which is carried out by means of a device in
relation to residential premises or a private vehicle, but which is carried outwithout the device being present on the premises or in the vehicle, is notintrusive ‘unless the device is such that it consistently provides information ofthe same quality and detail as might be expected to be obtained from a deviceactually present on the premises or in the vehicle’.
A person is defined as a ‘covert human intelligence source’ if he or she
establishes or maintains a personal or other relationship with a person for thecovert purpose of obtaining information or providing access to anyinformation to another person, or the covert disclosure of informationobtained by the use of such a relationship. The surveillance is covert if, andonly if, it is carried out in a manner that is calculated to ensure that personswho are subject to the surveillance are unaware that it is or may be takingplace. A purpose is covert if the relationship established or maintained isconducted in a manner calculated to ensure that one of the parties to therelationship is unaware of the purpose, and a relationship is used covertly,and information disclosed covertly, if it is used or disclosed in a mannercalculated to ensure that one of the parties to the relationship is unaware ofthe use or disclosure. 
Conduct is lawful for all purposes once authorised, provided that the
conduct of the authorised person is in accordance with the authorisation, andno civil liability attaches to any conduct which is incidental to any conductwhich is lawful. The conduct authorised includes conduct outside the UnitedKingdom. 
Authorisations may only be granted where this is necessary in the interests
of national security; for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or ofpreventing disorder; in the interest of the economic well being of the UnitedKingdom; in the interests of public safety; for the purpose of protecting publichealth; for the purpose of assessing or collecting taxes or charges due to agovernment department or for any purpose which is specified by an ordermade by the Secretary of State. An authorisation must not be granted unlessthe designated person believes that the authorised conduct is proportionate towhat is sought to be achieved by that conduct or use. An authorisation mustnot be granted unless there are arrangements in place which ensure that therewill be at all times a person having day to day responsibility for the agent, thatthere is another person in the relevant authority having general oversight ofthe use made of the agent, that there is a person having responsibility formaintaining a record of the use made of the agent containing such particularsas may be specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State and thatrecords that disclose the identity of the agent will not be available to personsexcept to the extent that such access to them is necessary.

Otherwise, the persons designated forthe purposes of sections 28 and 29 are senior officers of relevant publicauthorities -- being the police, National Criminal Intelligence Service, NationalCrime Squad, the intelligence services, Ministry of Defence, Her Majesty’sforces, Commissioners of Customs and Excise and any other such publicauthority granted power by order of the Secretary of State. In relation toNorthern Ireland, the grant of authorisations is also exercisable by the FirstMinister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly. Neither the Secretary ofState nor any senior authorising officer shall grant an authorisation for thecarrying out of intrusive surveillance unless he or she believes that theauthorisation is necessary in the interests of national security, for the purposeof preventing or detecting serious crime, or in the interests of the economicwell being of the United Kingdom, and that the authorised surveillance isproportionate to what is sought to be achieved by carrying it out. 
Commissioners and the Tribunal
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 repeals section 5 andSchedule 1 of the Security Services Act 1989 which provided for a Tribunal toinvestigate complaints. Section 9 and Schedules 1 and 2 to the IntelligenceServices Act 1994, which also provided for a Tribunal, are repealed andreplaced by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, Part IV. TheRegulation of Investigatory Powers Act imposes additional functions on theSecurity Service Act Commissioner and the Intelligence Services ActCommissioner, requiring them to keep under review, respectively – so far asthey are not required to be kept under review by the Interception ofCommunications Commissioner – the exercise and performance by theSecretary of State in relation to activities of the Security Service and activitiesof the Secret Intelligence Service and of GCHQ, and the activities in placesother than Northern Ireland of officials of the Ministry of Defence andmembers of Her Majesty’s forces. Additional functions are also conferred onthe Chief Surveillance Commissioner whose powers derive from the PoliceAct 1997.

Commissioner, is appointed by the Prime Minister. A person may only beappointed as Interception of Communications Commissioner if he or sheholds or has held a high judicial office. The Commissioner is under a duty toassist the Tribunal in connection with the investigation of any matter by theTribunal, or otherwise for the purposes of the Tribunal’s consideration or

It is the duty of all personsemployed by the Security and Intelligence Services and police to disclose orprovide to the Commissioner all such documents and information as he or shemay require for the purposes of enabling him or her to carry out his or herfunctions under Part IV. If it appears to the Commissioner that there has beena contravention of the provisions of the Act in relation to matters with whichhe is concerned, and that the contravention has not been the subject of a reportmade to the Prime Minister by the Tribunal, the Commissioner shall report tothe Prime Minister. The Commissioner makes an annual report to the PrimeMinister. The annual report is to be laid before each House of Parliament. If itappears to the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Interception ofCommunications Commissioner, that the publication of any matter in anannual report would be contrary to the public interest or prejudicial tonational security, the prevention or detection of serious crime, the economicwell being of the United Kingdom or the continued discharge of the functionsof any public authority whose activities include activities that are subject toreview by the Commissioner, the Prime Minister may exclude that matterfrom the report laid before each House. 
The Tribunal is the only tribunal to which proceedings under section 7 of
the Human Rights Act 1998 may be brought against any of the intelligenceservices, or any other person in relation to conduct by or on behalf of any ofthose services.
69Conduct to which proceedings relate is conduct by or on
behalf of any of the intelligence services, conduct relating to the interceptionof communications, conduct relating to the acquisition and disclosure ofcommunications data, conduct relating to surveillance, directed or intrusivesurveillance in Scotland or the use of any agent in Scotland, conduct relatingto protected information under section 46 and entrance into or interferencewith property or wireless telegraphy. The conduct in question must have beenconduct by or on behalf of a person holding any office, rank or position withany of the intelligence services, any of Her Majesty’s forces, any police force,the National Criminal Intelligence Service, National Crime Squad orCommissioners of Customs and Excise. The Secretary of State may by orderallocate additional jurisdiction to the Tribunal, but may only do so havingregard to the need to ensure that proceedings allocated to the Tribunal (fromany court or tribunal) are properly heard and considered, and the need toensure that information is not disclosed to an extent or in a manner that iscontrary to the public interest or prejudicial to national security, theprevention or detection of serious crime, the economic well being of theUnited Kingdom or the continued discharge of the functions of any of the

intelligence services. No order may be made unless a draft has been laid
before parliament and approved by a resolution of each House. 
It is the duty of the Tribunal to hear and determine any proceedings
brought, and to consider and determine any complaint or reference made to it.It is the duty of the Tribunal to investigate any alleged conduct, the authorityfor any conduct which it finds has been engaged in, and to determine thecomplaint by applying the same principles as would be applied by a court onan application for judicial review.
70The Tribunal is not under a duty to hear
or determine any complaint which is frivolous or vexatious. Complaints mustbe brought within one year after the taking place of the conduct to which itrelates, but the Tribunal may, if it is equitable to do so, extend the time. TheTribunal has the power to make an award of compensation. In addition, theTribunal may order the quashing or cancelling of any warrant orauthorisation and/or the destruction of any records of information. 
The extent to which the Commissioner is able to exercise any effective
control over the Secretary of State is unclear. The weakness of the whole basisof the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is reinforced by the absence of any appealtherefrom and the prohibition against questioning of the Tribunal andCommissioner before any court of law. With the exclusion of any form ofjudicial scrutiny of the Commissioner’s and Tribunal’s findings, the danger forthe individual is all too apparent. This arrangement is far different from thatpertaining in the United States, where security matters are regarded as beingwithin the competence of the courts. In United States v United District Court
(1972), the Supreme Court, in a unanimous judgment, declared that:
We cannot accept the government’s argument that internal security matters are
too subtle and complex for judicial evaluation. There is no reason to believethat federal judges will be insensitive to or uncomprehending of the issuesinvolved in domestic security cases ... If the threat is too subtle or complex forour senior enforcement officers to convey its significance to a court, one mayquestion whether there is probable cause for surveillance.

Solicitor General in the process of granting warrants.71
PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY OF THE SECURITY SERVICES
Matters of national security and the work of the Security Services havetraditionally been ones on which governments have declined to provideinformation to parliament. Parliamentary Committees repeatedly have beendenied the right to investigate the Security Service
72although, since 1979, the
Defence Committee has considered aspects of security. In 1989, theChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

government again rejected proposals that a select committee be established to
inquire into the Service.73In 1994, however, the Intelligence and Security
Committee was established with limited powers to investigate securitymatters. The Committee, which has a membership of nine, is established to‘examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the Security Service,the Intelligence Service and GCHQ’.
74Membership is confined to non-
ministerial Members of the House of Lords and House of Commons.Members are appointed by the Prime Minister, after consultation with theLeader of the Opposition.
75The establishment of the Committee, which is
based in Whitehall, rather than parliament, brings both MI6 and GCHQ undera weak form of quasi-parliamentary scrutiny although, operating ex post facto,
and lacking the openness of, for example, a select committee, its constitutionaleffectiveness must be questionable. The Committee must make an annualreport to the Prime Minister, which must be laid before parliament. However,should the Prime Minister feel that publication of any matter would be‘prejudicial to the continued discharge of the functions of the Services, orGCHQ’, the Prime Minister may exclude such matters from the report.
76
The Committee determines its own procedure.77Where the Committee
requests information from the Director General of the Security Service, theChief of the Intelligence Service or the Director of GCHQ, that informationmust be supplied unless the relevant person informs the Committee that itcannot be disclosed on the basis of sensitivity, or where the Secretary of Statehas determined that it should not be disclosed. The Secretary of State shall notrefuse to disclose information to the Committee on the basis of nationalsecurity alone: the criterion for non-disclosure is whether the Secretary ofState would think it proper not to disclose the information if requested to doso by a departmental select committee of the House of Commons.
78Schedule

(a) information which might lead to the identification of, or provide details of,

(b) information about particular operations which have been, are being or are

OFFICIAL SECRECY79
The Official Secrets Acts 1911–89
The 1911 Act 
The first Official Secrets Act arrived on the statute book in 1889. The latest Act
is that of 1989. The 1911 Act – which survived virtually untouched until 1989 –was passed through parliament with one hour’s debate and within 24 hours.Motivation for the 1911 Act lay in alleged enemy agent activity in thecountry.
80The motives behind the 1989 Act were formed largely from the
failure of the earlier Act. As will be seen, section 2 of the Act provided fornumerous offences based on vague criteria of disclosure of information andjuries have on occasion refused to convict, even where it was clear from thefacts and the law that a guilty verdict should have been returned.
81Official
inquiries into the working of the Act revealed deficiencies.82
The Spycatcher case also provided motivation for the government to reform
the law. In the government’s view, members and ex-members of the SecurityServices should be under a life long duty of confidentiality in respect of theirwork. One defect in the 1911 Act lay in the duty of – and hence liability for –non-disclosure enduring only for the duration of their employment. 
Section 1 of the 1911 Act provides penalties for spying. It is an offence to
enter into top-secret establishments or to collect, publish or communicate anyofficial document (which includes official code words, passwords, sketches,plans, models, articles or notes) or information which might be useful to apotential enemy, if the actions are carried out ‘for any purpose prejudicial tothe safety or interest of the state’. The accused has no ‘right to silence’ and atrial may be held in secret, or partly in secret. Section 2 of the Act reverses thenormal burden of proof from the prosecution to the defence. It is notnecessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused is guilty of anyparticular act ‘tending to show a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interest ofthe state’. Guilt may be established if ‘from the circumstances of the case, orhis conduct, or his known character as proved, it appears that his purpose wasa purpose prejudicial to the safety or interest of the state’. Moreover, anyinformation or document handed over to another person, without lawfulauthority, shall ‘be deemed to have been made, obtained, collected, recordedor communicated for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of thestate unless the contrary is proved’. Penalties for espionage are swingeing.George Blake, a former MI6 officer convicted of espionage, was sentenced toChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

42 years’ imprisonment.83In 1985, Michael Bettany, a former MI5 officer, was
convicted of attempting to pass official information to the Russians and
sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment. Geoffrey Prime was sentenced to 35years for disclosing material whilst employed at GCHQ.
84Not all offences
will lead to a prosecution. Neither Kim Philby nor Anthony Blunt wereprosecuted. Instead, each was offered immunity from prosecution in returnfor a confession, an offer declined by Kim Philby, who fled to Moscow.
Section 2 of the 1911 Act (now reformed under the Official Secrets Act
1989) prohibited the disclosure of any official information withoutauthorisation to anyone not authorised to receive it, and covered some onemillion public servants and a further one million government contractors. Italso covered the retention of any document by a person not entitled to retainthe same, failure to take reasonable care of a document, and receiving anydocument without authority. Section 2 was capable of generating over 2,000different criminal offences, including the disclosure of the number of cups oftea consumed in the MI5 canteen.
85
Reform of the Official Secrets Act 191186
The pressure for reform had mounted after the Aitken affair in 1971. The
government announced that a committee was to be set up to examine theworkings of section 2 of the Act. The Committee of Inquiry, headed by LordFranks, was highly critical of section 2 and recommended that it bereformed.
87It was not, however, until 1989 that reform took place.88
The major provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1989
Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 is repealed and replaced by the 1989Act. Rather than the catch-all section 2 of the 1911 Act, the 1989 Act createsoffences directed to specific groups of people and information. In relation tomost areas, the prosecution must prove both that the information has beenunlawfully transmitted and that the disclosure of the information is

‘damaging’. The concept of ‘damaging disclosure’ has, however, not been
incorporated into section 1 which relates to security and intelligence matters.With this exception, there is a presumption of harm built into the Act. Afurther exception relates to those who are not Crown servants or governmentcontractors in relation to whom the prosecution will have to prove – inaddition to the harm test – that the defendant knew or had good reason toknow that the specific harm was likely to have been caused. In relation to suchinformation, the disclosure in itself is an offence. There is no longer a defenceof ‘public good’ which applied under section 2 of the 1911 Act.
Security and intelligence
Under section 1 of the 1989 Act, any person who is, or has been, a member ofthe Security and Intelligence Services, and any other person who is informedthat the provision of the Act applies to him, is guilty of an offence if ‘withoutlawful authority’ he discloses ‘any information, document or other articlerelated to security or intelligence’. A person who is, or has been, a Crownservant or government contractor will be guilty of an offence if he makes a‘damaging disclosure of any information, document or other article relating tosecurity or intelligence’. In R v Shayler (2002), the House of Lords ruled that a
former member of the Security Services who was prosecuted under the Actwas not entitled to rely on the defence that the disclosure was made in thepublic or national interest. There was no contravention of Article 10 of theEuropean Convention through the restriction of members and formermembers of the security forces disclosing information. 
Security and intelligence are defined as being the work of, or work in
support of, the Security and Intelligence Services. A disclosure is defined asdamaging if ‘it causes damage to the work of, or of any part of, the Security orIntelligence Services’ or if unauthorised disclosure would be likely to causesuch damage. A charge may be defended if the person in question can provethat, at the time of the alleged offence, ‘he did not know, and had noreasonable cause to believe’ that the unauthorised disclosure related tosecurity or intelligence or, in the case of an offence under sub-section (3), hedid not know, or had no reasonable cause to believe, that the disclosure wouldbe damaging.
Defence
See section 2. Any unauthorised damaging disclosure of information,documents or other articles relating to defence is an offence. A disclosure isdamaging if ‘it damages the capability of any part of the armed forces, orleads to loss of life or injury to the forces, or endangers the interests of theUnited Kingdom abroad, or obstructs the promotion or protection of thoseinterests, or is likely to have any of these effects’. It is a defence to prove thatthe person did not know, and had no reasonable cause to believe, that suchdisclosure would be damaging.Chapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law
816

State Security
Section 4 defines ‘defence’ as including the ‘size, shape, organisation,
logistics, order of battle, deployment, operations, state of readiness and
training of the armed forces of the Crown; weapons, stores or otherequipment of those forces; defence policy and strategy, and military planningand intelligence; and plans and measures for the maintenance of essentialsupplies and services that are, or would be, needed in time of war’.
International relations
Under section 3 of the Official Secrets Act 1989, an unauthorised damagingdisclosure, by a person who is or has been a Crown servant or governmentcontractor, of any information, document or other article relating tointernational relations, or confidential information obtained from anotherstate or international organisation is an offence. A disclosure is damaging if it‘endangers the interests of the United Kingdom abroad, or seriously obstructsthe promotion or protection of those interests or endangers the safety ofBritish citizens abroad’, or ‘is likely to have any of those effects’. It is a defenceto prove that the accused did not know, and had no reasonable cause tobelieve, that the information fell within sub-section (1), or that its disclosurewould be damaging.
Crime and special investigation powers
Section 4 of the Act makes it an offence to disclose, without lawful authority,information, documents or other articles which result in the commission of anoffence, or facilitates an escape from legal custody or impedes the preventionor detection of offences or the apprehension or prosecution of suspectedoffenders, or disclosures which are likely to have those effects. It is a defenceto a charge to prove that the person did not know, and had no reasonablecause to believe, that the disclosure related to prohibited materials or thatdisclosure would have any of the damaging effects mentioned.
Authorised disclosures under the Act
A disclosure by a Crown servant (or other notified person) is authorised, if itis made with lawful authority and if (and only if) the disclosure is made inaccordance with a person’s official duty.
89In relation to government
contractors, a disclosure is lawful only if it is made with official authorisationor for the purposes of his functions relating to the contract and withoutcontravening an official restriction. In relation to any other person, adisclosure is lawful only if it is made to a Crown servant for the purposes ofhis functions as such, or in accordance with official authorisation. It is adefence to a charge to prove that, at the time of disclosure, he believed that hehad lawful authority to make the disclosure in question.
81789 Official Secrets Act 1989, s 7.

The duty to safeguard information
Under section 8, Crown servants and government contractors are under a
duty to protect any information, document or other article, which it would bean offence to disclose under the Act. It is an offence for a Crown servant toretain an article contrary to his or her official duty, and for a governmentcontractor to fail to comply with a request for the return or disposal of theinformation or document, or to fail to take such care of the information ordocument as ‘a person in his position may be reasonably expected to take’. Itis a defence for a Crown servant to prove that he believed he was acting inaccordance with his official duty and ‘had no reasonable cause to believeotherwise’.
Prosecutions
No prosecution may be instituted other than with the consent of the AttorneyGeneral.
90
Penalties
A person convicted of an offence under the Act, other than under section 8(1),(4) or (5), shall, on indictment, be liable to imprisonment for a two year term,or a fine, or both. On summary conviction, a person is liable to up to a sixmonth’s term of imprisonment, or a fine, or both. A person convicted undersection 8(1), (4) or (5) is liable, on summary conviction, to a term ofimprisonment of up to three months or a fine, or both. 
The catch-all nature of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 has thus
been reformed. Whether, in fact, the 1989 Act is less swingeing in scope isanother matter. Geoffrey Robertson QC states that the scope of the 1989legislation, ‘while not the theoretical dragnet of the old section 2, is none theless considerable’.
91
Restrictions on the media: ‘DA’ Notices92
The Official Secrets Acts of course apply to information which might berevealed by the press, and the doctrine of breach of confidence also representsa fetter on freedom of information. A further restriction on press freedom isthe ‘DA’ (Defence Advisory) Notice system. DA Notices are requests tonewspaper editors not to publish information. The basis for the system isentirely extralegal and voluntary. No formal sanction exists for failure toChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Ministry of Defence, which comprised both newspaper editors and civilservants.
94At the request of a government department, the committee will

non-compliance. The system is vague and defective. It is also contrary toprinciple to have a non-legal system which effectively fetters the freedom ofthe press. DA Notices are mainly issued to restrict publication of information‘relating to defence plans and equipment, nuclear weaponry, codes andcommunication interception, the Security Services, civil defence and thephotography of defence installations’.
96The system was reviewed in both
1962 and 1980, when retention of the system was recommended. The 1980inquiry by the Defence Committee of the House of Commons neverthelessexpressed reservations about retaining the system.
97
Judicial attitudes to pleas of national security
The principal avenue for legal redress of grievances against the executive inrelation to actions undertaken in pursuit of protecting national security is thatof judicial review, discussed in Chapters 24 and 25. It is apparent that thecourts are exceedingly reluctant to challenge the executive where nationalsecurity is pleaded by the government in judicial review proceedings. Whilstthis is, prima facie, regrettable from the point of view of the aggrieved citizen, it
is explained – although not necessarily justified – by the relationship betweenthe executive, legislature and judiciary. As seen in Chapter 5, the doctrine ofseparation of powers, whilst not strictly adhered to under the UnitedKingdom’s constitution, is respected by the courts. In no area of policy is thisrespect more clearly demonstrated than in matters of national security, whichwill frequently, but not inevitably, be linked to the exercise of the royalprerogative. In Chapter 6, the judiciary’s cautious approach to review of theprerogative was examined, and it was there seen that the prerogative ensuresfor the executive a wide and inadequately defined area of power which islargely immune from judicial review. It will be recalled that in Council of Civil
Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service (1985) (the GCHQ case), the House of
Lords ruled that the courts have jurisdiction to review the exercise of

executive power irrespective of whether the source of power was statutory, or
under the common law prerogative. 
Notwithstanding that claim, the House of Lords conceded that matters of
national security fell within the class of powers which were deemed ‘non-justiciable’ by the courts (by which is meant that the subject matter is onemore appropriately controlled by the executive accountable to parliamentrather than the courts of law). 
Detention in wartime
In Liversidge v Anderson (1942) ,the House of Lords refused98to review the
Home Secretary’s power of detention under the Defence of the Realm Acts. Itwill be recalled from Chapter 6 that the regulation provided that the ministerhad power to order detention of persons whom he ‘had reasonable cause tobelieve’ to be of hostile origin or associations and ‘in need of subjection topreventative control’. 
Detention with a view to deportation in peace time99
In 1962, Dr Soblen, an American citizen who had been convicted of espionagein the United States, fled from the country before being sentenced. Whilst onan aeroplane, Dr Soblen cut his wrists, and was taken off the plane in Londonfor hospital treatment. The Home Secretary issued a deportation order on thebasis that Soblen’s continued presence was ‘not conducive to the public good’.When Dr Soblen applied for habeas corpus, the Court of Appeal ruled that DrSoblen had no right to make representations, and that deportation was anadministrative matter for the Home Secretary.
100
In R v Home Secretary ex parte Hosenball (1977), two American journalists,
Philip Agee and Mark Hosenball, were detained with a view to deportation,on the basis that their work involved obtaining and publishing informationprejudicial to national security. When Hosenball tried to challenge the HomeSecretary’s decision in the courts, the Court of Appeal upheld the deportationorder. While recognising that the rules of natural justice had not beencomplied with, the Court of Appeal nevertheless ruled that the requirementsof national security prevailed, and that the Home Secretary was responsible toparliament, and not to the courts, for matters of security. 
The case of R v Home Secretary ex parte Cheblak (1991) also reveals the
extensive powers of the Home Secretary to detain persons ‘in the interests ofnational security’. In 1991, during the Gulf War, 160 Iraqi and PalestinianChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

citizens were detained with a view to deportation, on the basis that their
presence was not ‘conducive to the public good’. Abbas Cheblak and hisfamily had been resident in the United Kingdom for 16 years. In anapplication for habeas corpus, the Court of Appeal accepted the HomeSecretary’s explanation that Cheblak had associations with an unspecifiedorganisation which supported the Iraqi government, and refused to press theHome Secretary for further information.
101
Exercise of the Home Secretary’s powers which did result in judicial
criticism occurred in M v Home Office (1992–93) .The Home Secretary, Kenneth
Baker, had ignored an order of the court that M should not be returned toZaire, where he feared torture. Immigration officials put M on a plane, whichthe Home Secretary, refused to have turned back. The House of Lords heldthat an injunction could lie against ministers of the Crown, and that theywould be guilty of contempt of court – in their official capacity – for defianceof orders of the court. 
EMERGENCY POWERS
While, in peace time, the responsibility for maintaining order and detectingcrime lies with the police forces, in times of emergency, further assistance willbe needed if order is to be restored. In this section, the role of the armed forcesin support of the police is considered.
In peace time
Where serious civil unrest occurs, the government, acting in the name of theCrown, may issue a proclamation declaring a state of emergency under theEmergency Powers Act 1920, as amended by the Emergency Powers Act 1964.The proclamation, which has effect for a one month period, confers widepowers to govern by way of regulations. The grounds for making the orderare stipulated in the Act. Section 1(1) provides that, ‘if it appears to HisMajesty that there have occurred, or are about to occur, events of such anature as to be calculated, by interfering with the supply and distribution offood, water, fuel, or light, or with the means of locomotion, to deprive thecommunity, or any substantial portion of the community, of the essentials oflife, His Majesty may, by proclamation declare that a state of emergencyexists’. Where a proclamation is made, parliament must be immediatelyinformed and, if in recess, must be recalled within five days for debate on thematter.
Where a Proclamation has been made, according to section 2 of the Act,
Orders in Council may confer on a Secretary of State or government

department, or any person in the Crown’s service, such powers and duties ‘as
His Majesty may deem necessary for the preservation of the peace, forsecuring and maintaining the means and distribution of food, water, fuel,light, and other necessities, for maintaining the means of transit orlocomotion, and for any other purposes essential to the public safety and thelife of the community ...’. No power exists to impose compulsory militaryservice or industrial conscription, or to make it an offence to take part in anindustrial strike. The powers conferred may continue in force for up to sevendays, unless both Houses of Parliament resolve to extend the period.Regulations may be made for the summary trial of persons guilty of offencesagainst the regulations, conviction for which carries a maximum term ofimprisonment of three months, or a fine, or both. Any goods or moneyobtained through breach of the regulations may be forfeited.
The use of the armed forces in times of unrest
The use of troops in 1911 in South Wales is the only occasion on which troopshave been brought in to assist the police. During the miner’s strike 1984–85,the troops were not called in. Instead, the police forces co-ordinated theiroperations in order to contain the situation successfully. Where troops aredeemed necessary to aid the police, it is the Home Secretary, acting on therequest of the Chief Officer of police, who has responsibility. As was seen inChapter 6, the Home Secretary has the power to issue weapons to policeforces for the quelling of civil disturbance.
102
In time of war
The Defence of the Realm Acts 1914–15 conferred wide powers on the Crownto make Regulations for ensuring public safety and defence of the realm. Thecourt have ruled that these broad powers include the power to detain a personwithout trial on the basis of his or her hostile associations.
103The power to
regulate supplies did not include, however, the power to impose a tax uponproduce.
104Specific power to impose charges in relation to matters regulated
under Defence Regulations was conferred under the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act 1939. Under the regulations, the Home Secretary was givenpower to detain persons whom he had reasonable cause to believe camewithin certain categories. The power was regarded by the courts asreviewable.

Special powers in relation to Northern Ireland106
In Chapter 3, an outline history of the troubles in Northern Ireland isprovided. It will be recalled that the partition of Ireland, with six counties ofUlster being separated from the rest of Ireland and becoming the newlycreated state of Northern Ireland, did not quell the centuries of disturbancesbetween the mainly Catholic South of Ireland and the mainly Protestantnewly created Northern Ireland. In order to contain the terrorist activities ofthe Irish Republican Army,
107in 1922, the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)
Act108was passed by the Northern Ireland Parliament. From 1969, British
troops have been used in Northern Ireland in support of the civil authorities.In 1971 – under this Act – the internment of suspected terrorists wasintroduced. In 1973, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act waspassed at Westminster, amended in 1975 and re-enacted in 1978, 1987, 1991and 1996.
109In 1974, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act
was passed, initially for a five year renewable term. The Act was subsequentlyrenewed, although the 1989 Act was not subject to the five year term, but wassubject to annual renewal by parliament, as are parts of the Northern Ireland(Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. The Prevention of Terrorism (AdditionalPowers) Act 1996 further extended the law. The law is substantially reformedby the Terrorism Act 2000, discussed below, and supplemented by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

required annual renewal, the Terrorism Act has permanent status. In relation
to Northern Ireland, it had been hoped that special provision would no longerbe required for Northern Ireland following the peace settlement. However, inlight of the problems implementing full devolution to Northern Ireland,special provisions are included in Part VII of the Terrorism Act which aretime-limited to five years.
The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001
prompted a swift response from the British government. The Anti-Terrorism,Crime and Security Act 2001 builds on existing legislation in order to ensurethat the security forces have the necessary powers to combat terrorist threatsto the United Kingdom. The 2001 Act aims to cut off terrorist funding and toenable government departments and agencies to collect and share informationin the attempt to avert threats. The Act also alters immigration procedures,and provides additional powers for the detention of suspected internationalterrorists who have been certified by the Secretary of State as a threat tonational security. The Act also enhances the security of nuclear and aviationindustries and aims to improve the security of dangerous substances whichmay be used by terrorists. It also extends police powers and facilitates greaterco-operation between police forces. Controversially, the Act also provides forextended powers of disclosure of information and its retention from publicauthorities to the police and security agencies involved in criminalinvestigations. A statutory code of practice is to be drawn up in consultationwith industry and the Information Commissioner and approved byparliament by affirmative resolution procedure.

Defining terrorism
Whereas under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989,terrorism was defined as the ‘use of violence for political ends, and includesthe use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of thepublic in fear’,
112the Terrorism Act 2000 adopts a wider definition, namely:
In this Act ‘terrorism’ means the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a
political, religious or ideological cause, of action which –
(a) involves serious violence against any person or property,
(b) endangers the life of any person, or
(c) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the
public.113
Action includes action outside the United Kingdom, and references to any
person or to property refer to any person or property wherever situated, and areference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country otherChapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law

than the United Kingdom.114This definition is intended to cover not just
terrorism for political ends, as in the case of Northern Ireland, but terrorism
undertaken for religious or ideological motives, which, while not necessarilyviolent in themselves, are capable of having widespread adverse affects.Examples cited are of disruption to key computer systems or interference withthe supply of water or power where life, health or safety may be put at risk. 
Proscribed organisations
Part II of the 2000 Act relates to proscribed organisations, listed underSchedule 2.
115The Secretary of State may add or remove an organisation from
Schedule 2 or otherwise amend it, but may only add an organisation if hebelieves that the organisation is concerned in terrorism.
116An organisation is
concerned in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism,prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism, or is otherwiseconcerned in terrorism.
117The Act introduces a Proscribed Organisations
Appeal Commission (POAC),118to which individuals or organisations may
appeal, having first applied to the Secretary of State for deproscription andbeen refused.
119
The Commission must allow an appeal if it considers that the Secretary of
State’s decision was flawed when considered in the light of the principlesapplicable on an application for judicial review.
120If the appeal is allowed,
the Commission makes an order to that effect. Where an order is made, theSecretary of State must lay a draft order before parliament or, in urgent cases,make an order removing the organisation from the list in Schedule 2.
121
Appeals from the POAC, on a question of law, lie to the Court of Appeal,Court of Session or Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. An appeal may onlybe brought with the consent of the Commission or, where the Commissionrefuses permission, the permission of the relevant court.

825114 Terrorism Act 2000, s 1(2). The Court of Appeal ruled, in Secretary of State for the Home
Department v Rehman (2000), that the promotion of terrorism against any state by an
individual in the United Kingdom was capable of being a threat to the national security
of the United Kingdom, and accordingly the deportation in the interests of nationalsecurity for terrorist activities which were not targeted against the United Kingdom orits citizens was lawful under the Immigration Act 1971.

POAC is successful, and an order made deproscribing the organisation, any
individual convicted of an offence in relation to the organisation, provided theoffence was committed after the date of the Secretary of State’s refusal todeproscribe, may appeal against his conviction to the Court or Appeal orCrown Court and the court shall allow the appeal.
123In relation to the above,
reference to the Commission allowing an appeal shall be taken as a referenceto the Commission determining that an action of the Secretary of State isincompatible with a Convention right, and reference to the refusal todeproscribe against which an appeal was brought shall be taken as a referenceto the action of the Secretary of State which is found to be incompatible with aConvention right.
124In order that individuals seeking deproscription should
not be deterred from pursuing an appeal or from instituting proceedingsunder section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998, through a risk of prosecutionfor offences in relation to a proscribed organisation, section 10 provides thatevidence relating to anything done, and any documents submitted for theseproceedings, cannot be relied on in criminal proceedings for such an offenceexcept as part of the defence case.
Sections 11 to 13 relate to offences concerning membership of and support
for a proscribed organisation. A person guilty of an offence in relation tomembership under section 11 shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to aterm of imprisonment not exceeding ten years, to a fine or to both, and onsummary conviction, to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, toa fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or to both. It is a defence for aperson charged with an offence under section 11(1) to prove that theorganisation was not proscribed on the last occasion on which he became amember or began to profess to be a member, and that he has not taken part inthe activities of the organisation at any time while it was proscribed. Section12 relates to the support for a proscribed organisation and makes it an offenceto invite support, which is not restricted to the provision of money or otherproperty. It is an offence to arrange, manage or assist in arranging ormanaging a meeting which he knows is to support or further the activities of aproscribed organisation, or one which he knows is to be addressed by aperson who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation. It isalso an offence to address such a meeting where the purpose is to support theorganisation, or where he knows that the meeting is to be addressed by aperson who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation. Ameeting for these purposes means a meeting of three or more persons,whether or not the public are admitted.

On summary conviction, a person guiltyunder section 13 is liable to six months imprisonment, a fine not exceedinglevel five on the standard scale or to both. 
Terrorist property
Part III of the 2000 Act relates to terrorist property, defined under section 14 tomean money or other property which is likely to be used for the purposes ofterrorism (including any resources of a proscribed organisation), proceeds ofthe commission of acts of terrorism, and proceeds of acts carried out for thepurposes of terrorism. It is an offence to partake in fundraising for thepurposes of terrorism. Inviting others to provide, receiving or providingmoney or other property is an offence under section 15. In relation to invitingsupport from others or receiving money or other property, there must be anintention that it should be used, or reasonable cause to suspect that it may beused, for terrorist purposes. In relation to the provision of money or otherproperty, knowledge or reasonable cause to suspect that it will or may be usedfor terrorism is required. The use or possession of money for terroristpurposes is an offence under section 16, and involvement in fundingarrangements with knowledge or reasonable cause to suspect that it will beused for terrorist purposes is an offence under section 17. The concealment,removal, transfer or other mechanism for controlling terrorist property(‘money laundering’) is an offence under section 18. It is a defence to provethat the person did not know and had no reasonable cause to suspect that thearrangement related to terrorist property. Persons guilty of an offence undersections 15 to 18 are liable, on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for aterm not exceeding 14 years, a fine or to both or, on summary conviction, for aterm of imprisonment not exceeding six months, a fine not exceeding thestatutory maximum, or to both.
125A court before which a person is convicted
of an offence under sections 15 to 18 may make a forfeiture order undersection 23. 
Section 19 imposes a duty on banks and other businesses to report any
suspicion that someone is laundering terrorist money or committing any otherterrorist property offence to the police. Sub-section (5) exempts professionallegal advisers in relation to information obtained in privileged circumstances.Section 20 relates to information disclosures to the police, and provides that aperson so disclosing is not liable for breaching legal restrictions on disclosure.

Chapter 23: Constitutional and Administrative Law
828Section 21 covers those co-operating with the police, and provides that a
person does not commit an offence under sections 15 to 18 if he is acting withthe express consent of a constable. 
Part III of the Act introduces new powers for the police, customs officers
and immigration officers to seize cash
126at borders and to seek forfeiture of
cash in civil proceedings. This power enables cash being taken from NorthernIreland to Great Britain, and vice versa, to be seized, detained and forfeited.When cash is seized under section 25, the authorities have 48 hours in whichto seek continued detention or forfeiture. If neither of these occurs, the cashmust be returned. Continued detention is authorised under section 26, whichprovides for applications by authorised officers or Commissioners of Customsand Excise to a magistrates’ court or, in Scotland, an application by theprocurator fiscal to the sheriff. A person from whom the cash was seized, theperson on whose behalf it was being transported and any other person mayapply for the cash detained under section 25 to be returned.
127The
application will only be granted if the magistrates’ court or the sheriff issatisfied that continued detention is no longer justified, for example, becauseinvestigations into the source and use of the cash have been concluded. Theforfeiture of cash may be applied for by an authorised officer orCommissioners of Customs and Excise to the magistrates’ court or, inScotland, by the procurator fiscal to the sheriff. An order for forfeiture mayonly be granted if the magistrates’ court or sheriff is satisfied on the balance ofprobabilities that the cash is cash relating to terrorist purposes. No criminalproceedings for an offence under the Act are required.
128Appeals must be
lodged within 30 days, and if successful the cash returned.129If a forfeiture
order has been made in relation to a proscribed organisation, and theorganisation successfully appeals to the POAC for deproscription, cash whichhas been forfeited may be returned following an appeal.
130
The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 extends the law in order
to prevent terrorists gaining access to their money. The police may requirefinancial institutions to provide information on accounts of up to 90 days andit is an offence for such institutions not to report where there are reasonablegrounds for suspicion that funds are being used by terrorists. In order toprevent the use or removal of funds, cash and assets may now be seized byenforcement agencies whenever an investigation is started, rather than when aperson is about to be charged.

131Sections 33 to 36
give power to the police to designate and demarcate a specified area bycordons for the purposes of a terrorist investigation. It is an offence to fail tocomply with an order, prohibition or restriction imposed, on summaryconviction being liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding threemonths, a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale, or to both. It is adefence to prove that there is a reasonable excuse for failure to comply.
132
Under section 39, where a person knows or has reasonable cause to
suspect that a constable is conducting or proposes to conduct a terroristinvestigation, it is an offence to disclose to another anything which is likely toprejudice the investigation or to interfere with material which is likely to berelevant to the investigation. Where a person knows or has reasonable causeto suspect that a disclosure has been or will be made under any of sections 19to 21, it is an offence to disclose to another anything which is likely toprejudice an investigation resulting from the disclosure, or to interfere withmaterial likely to be relevant to an investigation resulting from the disclosure.This deterrent measure carries on conviction on indictment, imprisonment fora term not exceeding five years, a fine or to both or, on summary conviction,imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, a fine not exceeding thestatutory maximum or to both.
133
It is also an offence for a person to collect, make a record of, publish,
communicate or attempt to elicit information which is useful to a personcommitting or preparing an act of terrorism, or to possess a document orrecord containing information which would be useful.
134The offence is
confined to a person who is or has been a constable, a member of HerMajesty’s Forces, the holder of a judicial office, an officer of any court or a fulltime employee of the prison service in Northern Ireland.

occupier or premises which he habitually used otherwise than as a member ofthe public, the court may assume that the accused possessed the document orrecords, unless he proves that he did not know of its presence on the premisesor that he had no control over it. It is a defence to prove that he had areasonable excuse for his action or possession. Conviction under section 103on indictment carries a liability to a term of imprisonment not exceeding tenyears, a fine or to both or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment notexceeding six months, a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or to both. 
Counter-terrorist powers
A terrorist for the purposes of Part V of the 2000 Act is a person who hascommitted an offence under any of sections 11, 12 (membership or support fora proscribed organisation), 15 to 18 (fundraising and handling money), 54(relating to weapons training) and 56 to 63 (directing a terrorist organisationand offences relating to committing or inciting terrorism wholly or partlyoutside the United Kingdom), or is or has been concerned in the commission,preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
135A constable may arrest
without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist.136
A person must be released, unless detained under any other power, within 48hours. Where a review of a person’s detention has taken place and the reviewofficer does not authorise continued detention, the person shall be released. Apolice officer may make an application for a warrant extending a person’sdetention and, where the officer intends to make an application, the personmay be detained pending the making of the application and conclusion ofproceedings on the application. Where the application is granted, the personmay be detained during the period specified in the warrant. A constable mayapply for a warrant relating to specified premises if he is satisfied that thereare reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person suspected of terrorism isto be found there. The warrant authorises entry and search for the purpose ofarresting the person in question.
137
Stop and search powers relating to suspected terrorists include the power
to stop and search the person for evidence of being a terrorist, and an arrestedperson may be searched. Anything discovered in the course of a search whichthe constable reasonably suspects of being evidence that the person is aterrorist may be seized.

140Authorisations are for
a maximum, renewable, 28 days.141It is an offence to fail to comply with an
order to stop a vehicle, or to stop, or to wilfully obstruct a constable in theexercise of the power conferred by an authorisation under section 44. Onsummary conviction, a person guilty of an offence is liable to imprisonmentfor a term not exceeding six months, a fine not exceeding level five on thestandard scale or to both.

The Act makes weapons training for terrorist purposes an offence.
Formerly relating only to Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland(Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, the 2000 Act applies throughout the UnitedKingdom. The Act covers conventional firearms and explosives and extendsto cover chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and materials.
143It is an
offence to provide or receive instruction or invite another to receiveinstruction in the making or use of defined weapons. It is a defence to provethat the action or involvement was wholly for a purpose not concerned withterrorism. A person found guilty on indictment is liable to a term ofimprisonment of up to ten years, to a fine or to both or, on summaryconviction, to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, to a fine notexceeding the statutory maximum or to both.
144
It is an offence to possess articles in circumstances which give rise to a
reasonable suspicion that such possession is for a purpose connected with thecommission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. Section 57replicates section 16A of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions)Act 1989, and reverses the onus of proof, sub-section (2) providing that it is adefence for a person charged to prove that his possession of an article was notfor a purpose connected with terrorism. Article 6(2) of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, provides for the presumption of innocence ofthe defendant in criminal trials, and presumes that the prosecution will needto prove guilt. However, the reversal of the burden of proof does not per se
indicate a violation of the right to fair trial. The government certified that theBill complied with the Convention. In Kebeline’s case,

Terrorism overseas
Sections 59 to 64 of the 2000 Act regulate terrorism overseas. Under section 59,it is an offence to incite another person to commit an act of terrorism wholly orpartly outside the United Kingdom, if that act would constitute an offencelisted in sub-section (2) in England and Wales, namely, murder, woundingwith intent, offences involving poison, explosions and endangering life bydamaging property. A person found guilty shall be liable to any penalty towhich he would be liable on conviction of the relevant offence. Sections 60and 61 make equivalent provision in relation to Scotland and NorthernIreland. Section 62 regulates acts of terrorism outside the United Kingdominvolving causing explosions,
146the use of biological or chemical weapons,
and provides that a person committing such an act is guilty of an offence.Equally, it is an offence to do anything outside the United Kingdom whichwould amount to an offence under sections 15 to 18 if it had been done in theUnited Kingdom. Section 64 amends the Extradition Act 1989 to include theConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the Convention forthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
Port and border controls
Section 53 and Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act regulate border controls. An‘examining officer’, being a constable, immigration officer and customs officerdesignated for the purposes of Schedule 7 by the Secretary of State andCommissioners of Customs and Excise, has the power to stop, question anddetain a person, at an airport, hoverport or port or border area, for thepurposes of determining whether he or she is a person suspected of beingconcerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts ofterrorism.

Thecaptains of ships or aircraft travelling between Great Britain, the Republic ofIreland, Northern Ireland or any of the Islands are under a duty to ensure thatpassengers and members of crew do not disembark other than in accordancewith arrangements approved by an examining officer. Section 16 introducescarding arrangements, which require persons embarking or disembarking inrelation to journeys between Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland, NorthernIreland or any of the Islands to provide such information as the Secretary ofState, by order, may require. 
A person questioned is required to provide any information requested,

Commission (SIAC)156reviews such detention regularly, and its decisions are
excluded from judicial review. An appeal from the Commission on a point oflaw lies to the Court of Appeal.
Where the Secretary of State certifies that the removal of an asylum seeker
would be conducive to the public good, there is an expedited process ofdealing with the application. In relation to asylum and certain immigrationcases, the Act provides for the retention of fingerprints for ten years, in orderto prevent the creation of multiple identities which can be used in terrorist orcriminal activity.
The 2001 Act strengthens security powers in relation to the nuclear

INTRODUCTION TO 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW



CHAPTER 24
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW
Judicial review represents the means by which the courts control the exercise
of governmental power. Government departments, local authorities, tribunals,state agencies and agencies exercising powers which are governmental innature must exercise their powers in a lawful manner. Judicial review hasdeveloped to ensure that public bodies which exercise law making power oradjudicatory powers are kept within the confines of the power conferred.Judicial review is concerned with the legality of the decision made, not withthe merits of the particular decision. Accordingly, the task of the judges is toensure that the exercise of any power which has been delegated to ministersand administrative and adjudicatory bodies has been lawful according to thepower given to that body by Act of Parliament. As will be seen below, there isacademic debate concerning the appropriate basis on which the courtsexercise their supervisory jurisdiction. The traditional view has been that thejudge’s task is to ensure that public bodies act within their powers – or intra
vires – and that, provided that the body has acted within its powers as defined
by statute, and according to the common law based rules of natural justice, thebody’s decision will not be challengeable under the public law process ofjudicial review.
2
From this traditional perspective, judicial review is principally concerned
with questions of jurisdiction and natural justice. The primary question to beasked is whether a particular person or body with delegated law making oradjudicatory powers had acted intra vires or ultra vires , and whether the
decision making process entailed the application of natural justice. If theperson or body was acting within its jurisdiction, and respecting the demandsof natural justice, the courts would not interfere with the decision – even if thedecision was in some respect wrong. Nowadays, although the judges stillexpress their role in the traditional language of ‘ vires’, the approach taken is
more robust than before. If a public body, as defined in law, makes an error oflaw, the courts – through the process of judicial review – will intervene toensure that the body in question reconsiders a matter and acts in aprocedurally correct manner.

INTRODUCTION, JURISDICTION 
AND PROCEDURE1

2 See Chapter 25 on natural justice.3 See Chapter 25 for further discussion of the concept of ultra vires .

The uncertain and expanding role of judicial review causes controversy.4
Simply expressed, in any society regulated by a complex administrative
machinery, an essential feature of that society is that administrators have asphere of power within which, in the interests of certainty and efficiency, theyshould be free to operate. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility, discussedin Chapter 11, ensures that accountability for policy and administration lieswith the relevant Secretary of State, who is accountable to the electoratethrough parliament. However, against that argument for non-interferencewith matters of administration must be set the demands of individual justiceand fairness. If an individual, or a body of persons, is aggrieved by anadministrative decision, and their rights adversely affected, there exists arequirement that procedures exist whereby such decisions may be challengedin the courts. It is through judicial review that the requirements of legality ofthe exercise of powers by public bodies is tested. From this perspective,judicial review exemplifies the application of the rule of law
5in a democratic
society.6This raises a further question of constitutional significance. To what
extent is it legitimate for a non-elected judiciary to intervene to correct theadministrative process which is controlled through powers granted by thedemocratically elected parliament? One response to this question is thatjudicial review – with respect to the review of delegated law making andadjudicatory powers – ensures that parliament’s will is observed, and judicialreview may thus be regarded as an aspect of parliamentary sovereignty.
7
As a result of extensive regulation, powers have been conferred by
parliament upon various government departments, administrative bodies andtribunals – powers which must be exercised within the ‘four corners’ of thelegislation. Traditionally, judicial review has been regarded as unconcernedwith the merits of a particular case, or with the justice or injustice of the ruleswhich are being applied, but rather as being concerned with the manner inwhich decisions have been taken: has this decision maker acted within thepowers given? Most of the rules applied by administrators will be statutory,but the courts have also – under common law – developed rules which willapply to decision makers over and above the statutory rules. Thus, decisionmakers must not only exercise their powers in the correct manner asprescribed by the statute, but must also comply with the rules ofreasonableness, natural justice and fairness. In addition, due to the HumanRights Act 1998 the courts now have the additional task of ensuring – in partthrough judicial review – that public authorities do not violate protectedConvention rights. The Human Rights Act has profound implications forjudicial review, affecting not only an expansion in the role of the courts butChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law

in Richardson and Genn, 1994, Chapters 2 and 3, respectively.

also requiring different modes of interpretation than hitherto. These issues
will be discussed in the next chapter.
In essence – and subject to changes which have been brought about by the
Human Rights Act 1998, devolution to regional assemblies and the proposedFreedom of Information Act – the courts seek, by judicial review, to ensurefour principal objectives:
(a) that Acts of Parliament have been correctly interpreted;
(b) that discretion conferred by statute has been lawfully exercised; and
(c) that the decision maker has acted fairly;(d) that the exercise of power by a public body does not violate human rights.
THE GROWTH IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION8
Judicial review derives from the historical power of the courts to keep inferior
bodies within their legal powers. While ‘public administration’ may be tracedback to Elizabethan times,
9it was in the mid-nineteenth century that
government expanded its legislative and administrative functions into areashitherto untouched. The growth in the nineteenth century of industrialisationresulted in central regulation, for example, of town and country planning, theprovision of housing and housing improvement,
10public health, regulation of
the railways and factory management and schemes for compensation forinjury.
11One consequence of such regulation was the need for mechanisms
for resolving disputes between individuals and the regulatory bodies.Statutory inquiries became the formal mechanism by which disputes were tobe resolved.
The early twentieth century laid the foundations for the Welfare State. The
introduction of health insurance
12and measures to combat unemployment13
led to the establishment of tribunals of administration and adjudication. Themajor reform came with the publication of the Beveridge Report,
14which set
out radical proposals for extensive reforms in social welfare and led to theintroduction of the National Health Service. 
To portray succinctly the administrative system existing nowadays is not
an easy task. As with so much of the institutional framework of the state,developments have proceeded in a pragmatic, ad hoc fashion. In 1980, the

Report on Non-Departmental Public Bodies15classified administrative bodies into
executive bodies, advisory bodies and tribunals. The Report cited 489
executive bodies. The work of tribunals and inquiries had earlier beeninvestigated by the Franks Committee, whose report
16led to the passing of
the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958. Today, over 40 different tribunals exist,with jurisdiction over such diverse subject matters as commerce, economicmatters, education, employment, Foreign Compensation, housing, physicaland mental health, immigration, the National Health Service, pensions andresidential homes. 
What is a ‘public body’ for the purposes of judicial review? 
Judicial review is only available to test the lawfulness of decisions made bypublic bodies. If judicial review is applied for, and the court rules that thebody whose decision is being challenged is a private body, then the remedy ofthe aggrieved individual will lie in private law, not public law, proceedings.In determining whether or not the body whose decision is being challengedon an application for judicial review is a public, as opposed to private, body,the court will look at its functions. The test is not whether or not the authorityis a government body as such but, rather, whether it is a body exercisingpowers analogous to those of government bodies. National public agencieshave been a feature of administration since the Reform Act of 1832. The PoorLaw Commissioners established in 1834, for whom there was no responsibleMinister in Parliament (until 1847) are an early example of such an agency.The post-Second World War nationalisation programmes of the Labourgovernment between 1945 and 1951 and the expansion of welfare provision,both then and subsequently, resulted in numerous public bodies beingestablished which were not government bodies, nor were they part of localgovernment. Examples of such bodies include the British BroadcastingAuthority, Legal Aid Board (now the Legal Services Commission), AtomicEnergy Authority and British Airports Authority. It has been estimated that,by 1991, there were some 1,444 public bodies which were not related togovernment departments.
17In 1979, the incoming Conservative government
was firmly committed to privatisation. British Gas, British Airways, BritishRail, British Telecom, the water supply industry and electricity industry wereall privatised.
18The drive towards privatisation and reduced state holdings in
many other enterprises19has not, however, reduced the number of publicChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law

bodies. Parallelling the privatisation movement has been the growth in
standard setting and regulatory bodies designed to ensure appropriateaccountability of providers to consumers. The Police Complaints Authority,Lord Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct,Higher Education Funding Council, and Human Fertilisation andEmbryology Authority are all examples of such bodies which have beencreated under statute.
20Furthermore, there have been a number of regulatory
bodies established on a voluntary basis. The Press Complaints Commission,the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, the Advertising StandardsAuthority, the Jockey Club and Football Association are all examples of suchbodies. One question which arises is how the courts determine whether abody – howsoever established – is a public body and thus amenable to judicialreview of its decisions. The City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers provided anopportunity for judicial analysis of public and private bodies.
THE COURTS’ INTERPRETATION OF PUBLIC BODIES
In R v City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ex parte Datafin Ltd (1987), the
Takeover Panel had dismissed a complaint made by a bidder of ‘acting inconcert’ contrary to the rules on takeovers. The bidder applied for judicialreview. The court declined to grant the application on the basis that therewere no grounds for judicial review (on which, see below) but, nevertheless,rejected the claim made by the City Panel that the court had no jurisdiction toconsider the application. The Panel was subject to judicial review, despite itslack of statutory or prerogative source of power, because it was a bodyexercising public functions analogous to those which could be, or could havebeen in the absence of the Panel, exercised by a government department.
21
Lord Justice Lloyd stated that, for the most part, the source of the power willbe decisive. Accordingly, if a body is set up under statute or by delegatedlegislation, then the source of the power brings the body within the scope ofjudicial review. However, Lloyd LJ also recognised that in some cases thematter would be unclear. Where that situation existed, it was necessary tolook beyond the source of the power and consider the ‘nature of the power’being exercised. In Lloyd LJ’s view, ‘[i]f a body in question is exercising publiclaw functions, or if the exercise of its functions have public law consequences,then that may be sufficient to bring the body within the reach of judicialreview’. 
By contrast with the City Panel on Takeover and Mergers case, in R v
Disciplinary Committee of the Jockey Club ex parte Aga Khan (1993), the Aga Khan
84120 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and Higher
Education Act 1992, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.
21 See Lee, 1987; and Jowell, 1991.

sought judicial review of the Jockey Club’s decision to disqualify his winning
horse from a race for failing a dope test, and the court ruled that it had nojurisdiction. The relationship between racehorse owners and the Club, and thepowers of the Club, derived from agreement between the parties and was amatter of private rather than public law.
22The same principle will be applied
whenever a matter is regulated by contract between two private parties – thematter is one of private and not public law. There is a fine distinction to bedrawn here. The regulation of a private school, for example, has been held tobe a matter of private law, whereas the regulation of City Technical Colleges,a non-fee paying publicly funded institution, is a matter of public law.However, where a pupil attends a private school under a publicly fundedassisted places scheme, that school falls within the jurisdiction for judicialreview in relation to the school’s decision, in particular, the decision to expel apupil.
23
Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, public authorities are
defined as including courts and tribunals and ‘any person certain of whosefunctions are functions of a public nature’. The Act excludes both Houses ofParliament and those acting in connection with parliamentary proceedings.For the purposes of judicial review, section 7 provides that an applicant isonly to have sufficient interest if he or she is a victim of the unlawful act. Inrelation to proceedings relating to judicial acts, these may be brought only byexercising a right of appeal or by an application for judicial review.
24
Review and appeal25
Judicial review must be distinguished from an appeal against a decision. Thecourt and tribunal structure provides a more or less rational appeal structurefor those aggrieved by a judicial decision. The appellate court will have thepower to reconsider the case and to substitute its own decision for that of thelower court. An appeal may be made on both the law and the facts of the case,so that a full re-hearing may take place. Judicial review, by contrast, isconcerned solely with the manner in which the decision maker has appliedthe relevant rules: it is thus procedural in nature. It is not for the court – injudicial review proceedings – to substitute its judgment for that of the decisionmaking body to which powers have been delegated but, rather, to ensure thatthe adjudicator has kept within the rules laid down by statute and thecommon law. In short, the role of the courts in judicial review is to exercise asupervisory, not an appellate, jurisdiction. Judicial review ‘is not an appealChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was
made’.26
Judicial review derives from the courts’ inherent powers to keep decision
making bodies within the bounds of their powers, and to provide remediesfor abuse of power, and its purpose is not to substitute a decision of the courtfor the decision of the administrative body. 
Applying for leave for judicial review
For the criteria, see below. It must be noted here that there is no unfetteredright to judicial review. The aggrieved individual must seek leave to apply forjudicial review, and a number of criteria, which are discussed below, governthe exercise of the discretion to grant or refuse the application for judicialreview. 
The requirement to seek leave for judicial review is controversial, and
there are cogent arguments for its repeal. For example, the JUSTICE-All SoulsReport
27argued for repeal on the basis, first, that the leave requirement is
discriminatory; secondly, that the justification for leave based on eliminating‘groundless, unmeritorious or tardy harassment’ on the part of applicants canbe dealt with in the same manner as in ordinary litigation;
28and, thirdly, that
the issue of standing is no longer finally determined at the stage at which theapplication for leave is considered; see, further, below. However, there issupport for the view that, while the need to seek leave represents a proceduralhurdle which does not exist in other areas of the law, there remains a need tofilter out unmeritorious cases at an early stage. The Law Commission has re-examined the question of application for leave and concluded that it remains‘essential to filter out hopeless applications for judicial review by arequirement such as leave’.
29
The outcome of judicial review
Differences also exist in the respective outcomes of appeal and judicial review.In the case of appeals, where the appeal is successful, it will usually result in anew decision being substituted for the previous decision.
30In the case of
review, a successful case will usually result in the previous decision beingnullified – or quashed – but no new decision will be put in its place. Instead,the body in relation to which a successful application for judicial review has

been made will be directed to redetermine the case according to the correct
rules and procedure, and it is by no means inevitable that the decision reachedaccording to the lawful procedure will be more favourable to the individualthan the original decision.
31
Furthermore, there is no automatic right to a remedy in judicial review
proceedings: the remedy is discretionary. The matter is contentious.32In some
cases, the court will decline to grant a remedy. The court may hold, forexample, that, while the decision making process was defective, nevertheless,the applicant has suffered no injustice, or that, even if a remedy were granted,the decision maker would reach the same conclusion on the merits, or that theimpact on administration would be too great if a remedy were granted. 
THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICIABILITY
Justiciability is a concept which defines the judges’ view of the suitability ofthe subject matter to be judicially reviewed. There are some matters in relationto which the courts – mindful of the doctrine of separation of powers – proveto be exceedingly reluctant to review. Matters such as the exercise ofprerogative power and, most importantly, issues of national security, andmatters of high policy, the courts may regard as non-justiciable.
Matters of public policy not for judicial review33
Where a matter complained of involves issues of high policy, the courts willdecline to exercise a supervisory function over such decisions. Matters ofpublic policy are for determination by the executive, and not the judiciary,and any purported attempt to control the decision would be regarded as aviolation of the separation of powers and an intrusion into the proper decisionmaking sphere of the executive. For example, in Nottinghamshire County
Council v Secretary of State for the Environment (1986), it was held that the court
should not intervene to quash guidance drafted by the Secretary of State, onthe authority of parliament, setting limits to public expenditure by localauthorities. Lord Scarman ruled that:
Unless and until a statute provides otherwise, or it is established that the
Secretary of State has abused his power, these are matters of political judgmentfor him and for the House of Commons. They are not for the judges or yourLordships’ House in its judicial capacity. 
Similarly, in Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v Department of
the Environment (1991), concerning the lawfulness of ‘charge capping’ local
authorities (penalising local authorities for exceeding their budgets), theChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
84431 See Harlow, 1976.
32 See Bingham, 1991.
33 Hammond, 1998.

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
House of Lords ruled that the decision was not open to challenge on the
grounds of irrationality ‘short of the extremes of bad faith, improper motive ormanifest absurdity’. Lord Bridge went on to rule that such decisions, relatingto national economic policy, ‘are matters depending essentially on politicaljudgment’ and that, in the absence of any evidence of bad faith or abuse ofpower, the courts would be ‘exceeding their proper function if they presumedto condemn the policy as unreasonable’. In R v Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration ex parte Dyer (1994), Simon Brown LJ held that matters of
national policy were not open to challenge before the courts other than on thebasis of bad faith, improper motive or manifest absurdity. Matters of nationaleconomic policy were for political – not judicial – judgment. See, further,below.
Judges also adopt a cautious attitude when it comes to reviewing the
exercise of the royal prerogative and will decline so to do in particular whereissues of national security are involved. Many of the matters which the courtsregard as non-justiciable – that is to say, not within judicial competence todetermine – fall within the royal prerogative. However, as discussed inChapter 6, the courts will not decline to judicially review a matter simplybecause the source of the power exercised is the royal prerogative. The Houseof Lords made it clear in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil
Service (1985) that the source of the power was not determinative of whether
the courts would review, but rather the matter to be decided was whether thesubject matter of the application was justiciable or not.
34
LIMITATIONS ON JUDICIAL REVIEW
It is a first principle of justice and the rule of law that public bodies arerequired to act within the scope of the powers allocated to them by parliamentand, accordingly, in principle, judicial review should lie wherever the vires of
administrative action is in question. However, that principle must be set in thebalance against the needs of certain administration, and the necessaryrestrictions which may be imposed on individuals or bodies seeking todisrupt the administrative process, without good cause. The balance to bestruck between these often competing principles is a difficult matter. Whereparliament limits the availability of judicial review, the courts will adopt arestrictive interpretation to the statutory words, employing the presumptionthat parliament did not intend – save in the most express manner – to excludethe jurisdiction of the courts. A number of different statutory means areemployed in the attempt to limit the availability of judicial review. Insummary, parliament may adopt the following means:
84534 See, also, Attorney General v de Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd (1920); Laker Airways v Department
of Trade (1977); R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades’ Union
and Others (1995); M v Home Office (1993).

(a) the general requirement that applications for judicial review are brought
within three months of the challenged decision;
(b) clauses which are intended to prevent any challenge;
(c) clauses which are designed to limit review to a specified time period in
relation to particular matters where delay needs to be avoided;
(d) ‘conclusive evidence’ clauses.
Attempts to exclude judicial review totally
In R v Medical Appeal Tribunal ex parte Gilmore (1957), the statute provided that
‘the decision on any medical question by a medical appeal tribunal ... is final’.Under an industrial injuries scheme, compensation for accidental industrialinjuries was set under a tariff. Gilmore lost the sight of both eyes in twoaccidents and was assessed at a disablement of 20 per cent. The tariff providedthat the loss of sight in both eyes entitled the applicant to a 100 per centassessment. The tribunal had, accordingly, made an error of law. However,the opportunity for the court to redress the wrong turned on the exclusion ofreview in the statute. The Court of Appeal held that the jurisdiction of thecourt was not ousted by the statutory words; Denning LJ, stating that:
... the remedy of certiorari is never to be taken away by any statute except by
the most clear and explicit words. The word ‘final’ is not enough. That onlymeans ‘without appeal’. It does not mean ‘without recourse to certiorari’. Itmakes the decision final on the facts, but not final on the law. Notwithstandingthat the decision is by a statute made ‘final’, certiorari can still issue for excessof jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record ... [p 583]
However, in South East Asia Firebricks v Non-Metallic Mineral Products
Manufacturing Employees’ Union (1981) ,an ‘ouster clause’ succeeded. The
Malaysian Industrial Court, in a successful legal challenge by trades unions,
had ordered employers to take back employees after a strike. Statute35
provided that an award of the Court shall be ‘final and conclusive’ and that ‘...no award shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or calledinto question in any court of law’. 
The Privy Council, citing Gilmore with approval, nevertheless
distinguished between an error which affected the jurisdiction of the court tomake a determination
36and decisions which, whilst in error, were not of such
a fundamental nature as to deprive the court of jurisdiction. In this case, theerror was within the jurisdiction of the court and, accordingly, the ousterclause was effective. According to Lord Fraser of Tullybelton:
... the Industrial Court applied its mind to the proper question for the purpose
of making its award. The award was accordingly within the jurisdiction of thatcourt, and neither party has contended to the contrary ... the error or errors didChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
84635 Industrial Relations Act 1967, s 29(3)(a).

not affect the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court and their Lordships are
therefore of the opinion that section 29(3)(a) effectively ousted the jurisdictionof the High Court to quash the decision by certiorari proceedings ...[pp 373–74]
The seminal case on ouster clauses is Anisminic v Foreign Compensation
Commission (1969).37In 1956, property in Egypt belonging to an English
company was sequestrated by the Egyptian authorities and subsequently sold
to an Egyptian organisation, TEDO. Anisminic then sold to TEDO its miningbusiness. In 1959, a Treaty signed by the United Kingdom and the UnitedArab Republic provided for the return of sequestrated property, other thanproperty sequestrated in a period during which Anisminic’s property wastaken over. The Foreign Compensation Commission (FCC), established tomake awards of compensation to companies adversely affected bysequestration of property, ruled that Anisminic did not qualify forcompensation. The Foreign Compensation Order 1962,
38Article 4(1)(b)(ii),
provided that that both the applicant and the successor in title be Britishnationals. TEDO – the successor in title – was not a British national and,accordingly, Anisminic’s claim failed. The Foreign Compensation Act 1950provided that the decisions of the FCC ‘shall not be called in question in anycourt of law’.
39
Anisminic sought judicial review of the FCC’s decision. The question for
the court was whether the phrase ‘shall not be questioned’ succeeded inousting the jurisdiction of the courts, or whether, notwithstanding thatsection, the courts had the power to rule on the lawfulness of the FCC’sdecision. The House of Lords ruled that the jurisdiction of the courts was notousted. Accordingly the court had power to review the FCC’s decision, whichit declared to be null and void. The FCC had acted outside its jurisdiction bymisinterpreting the Order in Council and reached a decision based on aground which it was not entitled to take into account, namely the nationalityof the successor in title. The nationality of the successor in title, according tothe House of Lords, was not a relevant consideration when the applicant wasthe original owner of the sequestered property. The House of Lords ruledunanimously that section 4(4) did not protect decisions which were takenoutside of jurisdiction. 
The Anisminic decision raises complex issues. The House of Lords
appeared to destroy the distinction between errors of law within thejurisdiction of the decision making body, which had previously been regardedas non-reviewable, and errors of law which took the decision maker outsideits jurisdiction and were therefore reviewable. In effect, clauses whichattempted to oust the jurisdiction of the courts appeared to have been
84737 See Wade, 1969.

39 Foreign Compensation Act 1950, s 4(4).

rendered meaningless. The problem which remains is whether Anisminic
provides clear guidelines as to how to distinguish between those elements of a
tribunal’s decision which, if decided incorrectly, cause the tribunal to exceedits jurisdiction, and those aspects of a tribunal’s decision which, althoughdecided incorrectly, do not cause the tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction — inother words the error is ‘within jurisdiction’. The decision also reveals judicialemphasis on the rule of law – even in the face of apparently clear words thatparliament does not intend review to take place. In the view of Wade andForsyth (1994), the judges in Anisminic have ensured that the courts are ‘the
exclusive arbiters on all questions of law’.
In Pearlman v Keepers and Governors of Harrow School (1979) ,the Court of
Appeal ruled that the misinterpretation of provisions in the Housing Act 1974,by the county court, amounted to a ‘jurisdictional error’ which nullified thecourt’s decision. Lord Denning MR, in Pearlman, stated that the distinction
between errors which entail an excess of jurisdiction and an error made withinjurisdiction should be abandoned.
The question of exactly which errors of law are ‘jurisdictional’ was
considered in Re Racal Communication Ltd (1981). In Racal, the Director of
Public Prosecutions (DPP) sought an order of the court
40in order to obtain
evidence relating to an alleged offence. The order was refused. Section 441(3)of the Companies Act provided that no appeal lay from a decision of the judgehearing the application. Nevertheless, the DPP appealed, and the Court ofAppeal allowed the appeal, relying on Anisminic and Pearlman. Lord Denning
ruled that the ‘no appeal’ clause was of no effect, for the judge hadmisconstrued the words in section 411 of the Act. The House of Lordsoverturned the Court of Appeal’s decision, approving of Geoffrey Lane LJ’sdissenting judgment in Pearlman, in which he had held that the judge had
done nothing which was outside his scope of inquiry. A distinction wasdrawn between errors made by a tribunal or other administrative bodies,which would be reviewable, and errors made by a court of law. Lord Diplock,in Racal, supported the view expressed by Lord Denning MR in Pearlman ,
stating that:
The breakthrough made by Anisminic was that, as respects administrative
tribunals and authorities, the old distinction between errors of law that went to
jurisdiction and errors of law that did not was for practical purposes abolished[p 383].
A further distinction, and limitation to the Anisminic principle, is to be seen in
R v Lord President of the Privy Council ex parte Page (1992). There, the issue
concerned a decision made by a university Visitor, and whether such a
decision was reviewable on the basis of Anisminic. The House of Lords ruled
that it was not. The powers of Visitors were established by the founder of theuniversity, who had established a body of law and the office of Visitor toChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
84840 Under the Companies Act 1948, s 411.

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
enforce that ‘domestic’ law. Accordingly, perLord Browne-Wilkinson, the
Visitor could not ‘err in law in reaching his decision since the general law is
not the applicable law’. Accordingly the Visitor could not act ultra vires by
applying his interpretation of the rules of the university. Jurisdiction to reviewdid lie in cases where the Visitor acted outside his jurisdiction, or where heacted without regard to the rules of natural justice. However, there was nojurisdiction to review decisions taken within jurisdiction. 
Time limits on judicial review
In the attempt to protect decisions from challenges which may impede orotherwise affect their implementation, statute may provide that there shouldbe no challenge by way of judicial review other than within a specified timeperiod. Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council (1956) illustrates the attitude of
the courts to such time limits. In Smith, a challenge to the validity of a
compulsory purchase order was limited, under statute, to a six week periodfollowing the date of confirmation of the order. If not challenged within thatperiod the order ‘shall not ... be questioned in any legal proceedingswhatsoever’. Mrs Smith did not challenge the order within the time limit but,some six years later, sought to challenge the order on the basis that the clerk tothe council had acted in bad faith, and that bad faith was a ground on which –despite the clear wording of the time limit in the statute – the order’s validitycould be impugned. The House of Lords, by a majority, rejected this view. Itwas, however, unanimously agreed that Mrs Smith could proceed against theclerk to the council, for damages, on the basis of bad faith in procuring theorder. Viscount Simonds explained the attitude of the court:
My Lords, I think that anyone bred in the tradition of the law is likely to regard
with little sympathy legislative provisions for ousting the jurisdiction of thecourt ... But it is our plain duty to give the words of an Act their propermeaning, and ... I find it quite impossible to qualify the words ... in the mannersuggested ... What is abundantly clear is that words are used which are wideenough to cover any kind of challenge which an aggrieved person may thinkfit to make. I cannot think of any wider words ... I come, then to the conclusionthat the court cannot entertain this action in so far as it impugns the validity ofthe compulsory purchase order ... [pp 750–52]
The Court of Appeal in R v Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Ostler
(1976) followed the reasoning in Smith. In Ostler , the Highways Act 195941
provided that an aggrieved person had the right to challenge the validity of a
compulsory purchase order – on the basis of ultra vires – within six weeks
from the date of publication of the order. Subject to that right, the order ‘shallnot be questioned in any legal proceedings whatsoever’. The proposed roadbuilding scheme had two stages. The first involved the acquisition of the landfor the main road; the second related to the acquisition of land for the side
84941 Schedule 2, paras 2 and 3.

roads which would give access to the main road. Two public inquiries were
held, at the first of which there were allegations that an officer of theDepartment of the Environment had given assurances that vehicular accesswould be gained by a widening of the access road during the second phase ofthe development. Ostler’s business would be affected by the widening of theaccess road, but he was unaware of the assurance allegedly given at theinquiry and did not challenge the decision. At the second inquiry, Ostlerwished to object to the road widening, and wanted to give evidence that hewould have objected at the first inquiry had he known of the secretundertaking. He was refused permission to give evidence on the basis that hisobjection related to the first stage of the development. Ostler subsequentlylearned of the undertakings and sought to challenge the compulsory order onthe ground that natural justice had been denied and that the order had beenmade in bad faith amounting to fraud. The court accepted that, had Ostlerchallenged the order within six weeks, the court would have considered hiscomplaint. The court was faced with the question as to whether Anisminic
applied, or whether the decision in Smith v East Elloe was the relevant
precedent. Lord Denning MR considered the two precedent decisions anddistinguished between them in three respects. First, the limitation in the Smith
case amounted to a time limitation for review, as opposed to a purported totalouster of jurisdiction as in Anisminic . Secondly, the decision by the Foreign
Compensation Board in Anisminic was a ‘truly judicial’ decision, whereas that
in Smith was an administrative decision. Thirdly, in Anisminic, the court was
required to consider the ‘actual determination of the tribunal’, whereas, inSmith, the court was considering the process by which the decision was
reached. Lord Denning concluded:
... the policy of the 1959 Act is that when a compulsory purchase order has
been made, then if it has been wrongly obtained or made, a person aggrievedshould have a remedy. But he must come promptly. He must come within sixweeks. If he does so, the court can and will entertain his complaint. But if thesix weeks expire without any application being made, the court cannotentertain it afterwards. The reason is because, as soon as that time has elapsed,the authority will take steps to acquire property, demolish it and so forth. Thepublic interest demand that they should be safe in doing so. [pp 95–96]
Exclusion of review by ‘conclusive evidence clauses’
Parliament may effectively oust the jurisdiction of the courts by inserting a
clause into statute which provides that a subordinate piece of legislation shallhave effect ‘as if enacted in this Act’, or that confirmation of an order by adesignated minister shall be ‘conclusive evidence that the requirements of thisAct have been complied with, and that the order has been duly made and iswithin the powers of this Act’. Such clauses were strongly criticised in 1932 bythe Committee on Ministers’ Powers
42but, nevertheless, they continue to beChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
85042 Cmd 4060, 1932, London: HMSO.

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
used and have been effective in ousting judicial review. In R v Registrar of
Companies ex parte Central Bank of India (1986), for example, a clause in the
Companies Act 1985 effectively ousted the jurisdiction of the courts. PP Craig
comments that such clauses have ‘passed out of fashion’.43Nevertheless, the
potential for their use, and their effectiveness, provides the basis for adamaging exclusion of judicial review.
THE BASIS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
The Supreme Court Act 1981
The basis for review today lies in section 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981and the Civil Procedure Rules 1998.
Section 31 provides, in part, that:
(1) An application to the High Court for one or more of the following forms of
relief, namely:
(a) an order of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari;(b) a declaration or injunction under sub-section (2); or
(c) an injunction under section 30 restraining a person not entitled to do so
from acting in an office to which that section applies, 
shall be made in accordance with rules of court by a procedure to be
known as an application for judicial review.
(2) A declaration may be made or an injunction granted under this subsection
in any case where an application for judicial review, seeking that relief, hasbeen made and the High Court considers that, having regard to:
(a) the nature of the matters in respect of which relief may be granted by
orders of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari;
(b) the nature of the persons and bodies against whom relief may be
granted by such orders; and
(c) all the circumstances of the case, it would be just and convenient for the declaration to be made or for the
injunction to be granted, as the case may be.
(3) No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the
High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and thecourt shall not grant leave to make such an application unless it considersthat the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which theapplication relates.
Under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, an action must be brought within three
months of the decision against which review is sought. However, shorter timeperiods may be specified in statute and these must be complied with.
85143 Craig, 1994a, p 604.

STANDING TO APPLY FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW44
The ‘sufficient interest’ test45
The Supreme Court Act 1981 provides that the court must not grant leave for
an application for judicial review ‘unless it considers that the applicant has asufficient interest [otherwise expressed as “standing” or locus standi ] in the
matter to which the application relates’. The justification for such arequirement lies in the need to limit challenges to administrative decisionmaking to genuine cases of grievance and to avoid unnecessary interferencein the administrative process by those whose objectives are not authentic. Theapplicant may be an individual whose personal rights and interests have beenaffected by a decision, or an individual concerned with official decisionswhich affect the interests of society as a whole. Alternatively, the applicationmay be brought by an interest or pressure group desiring to challenge adecision which affects the rights and interests of members of that group orsociety at large. 
The manner in which the test is applied
The test of ‘sufficient interest’ was provided in R v Inland Revenue
Commissioners ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses(1982). The House of Lords’ approach was as follows. The question as towhether there is standing should be examined in two stages. At the firstinstance, standing should be considered when leave to apply is sought. Atthat stage, the court is concerned, according to Lord Scarman, to ensure that ‘itprevents abuse by busybodies, cranks and other mischief makers’. If leave isgranted, the court may – at a second stage, when the merits of the case areknown – revise its original decision and decide that after all the applicants donot have sufficient interest. 
Individual standing: personal rights and interests
Given the breadth of administrative decision making in a heavily regulatedsociety, individuals may have their rights or expectations affected inmultifarious ways, as has been seen above. Two further examples from thecase law illustrate the concept of individual standing. In Schmidt v Secretary of
State for Home Affairs (1969), students who had entered the country as
‘students of scientology’ challenged the decision of the Home Office not toallow them to remain once the permitted period of stay had expired. Thestudents had a ‘legitimate expectation’ (see below) that they would beallowed to make representations to the Home Office, which they were denied,over a matter affecting their individual liberty. The students had ‘sufficientinterest’ for leave to be granted. Chapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
85244 See Cane, 1980; Schiemann, 1990.
45 Supreme Court Act 1981, s 31(3).

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
In R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte Rees-
Mogg (1994) ,the applicant sought judicial review of the government’s
ratification of the Treaty on European Union without parliamentary consent.
Rees-Mogg was held to have sufficient standing, but the application wasdismissed on the basis that the issue was non-justiciable.
46
The standing of interest and pressure groups
Actions in defence of the group’s own interests
A group may have its interests adversely affected by administrative decisionmaking. By way of illustration, in R v Liverpool Corporation ex parte Liverpool
Taxi Fleet Operators’ Association (1972) ,Liverpool Corporation had the duty of
licensing taxis and fixing the number of licences to be granted. When theCorporation announced that the number of licences was to be increased,without consulting the Operators’ Association, leave to apply for judicialreview was sought. The Association had sufficient standing. Equally, in Royal
College of Nursing v Department for Health and Social Security (1981) ,the Royal
College had standing to challenge a departmental circular concerning the roleof nurses in abortions.
Both these cases involve organisations seeking to challenge decisions
which affect their own members. Accordingly, the standing requirement isrelatively easy to satisfy, since each of their members would have individualstanding. The position is less straightforward where a group seeks to defendwhat it regards as the wider interests of society.
The standing of interest and pressure groups acting in the public interest
Inland Revenue Commissioners v National Federation of Self-Employed and SmallBusinesses (1982) provided the test for standing. The facts, in brief, entailed the
employment of casual labour on newspapers, where the workers frequentlyadopted false names and paid no income tax. The Inland RevenueCommissioners (the IRC) entered into an agreement with the relevant tradesunions, workers and employers, to the effect that, if the workers filled in taxreturns for the previous two years, the IRC would not pursue tax due forprevious years. The National Federation (an association of taxpayers) arguedthat the IRC had no power to enter into this agreement and sought judicialreview. The IRC defended the action on the basis that the National Federationdid not have sufficient interest – or standing ( locus standi ) – to apply for
judicial review. The court upheld the IRC’s claim. The House of Lords ruledthat the court had been correct in granting leave at the first stage, but that onthe facts – the second stage – the National Federation lacked sufficient interest
85346 For the meaning of ‘justiciability’, see above. See, also, Blackburn v Attorney General
(1971), wherein a challenge to accession to the Treaty of Rome was unsuccessfully
challenged.

to challenge the legality of the agreement. The House of Lords ruled that there
was no standing to challenge the particular wrongdoing alleged but that, ifthe Revenue had in fact been acting with impropriety, there would have beenstanding in a taxpayer to challenge its unlawful acts. In R v Her Majesty’s
Treasury ex parte Smedley (1985), the applicant for review sought to challenge
the decision of the Treasury to pay a sum of money from the ConsolidatedFund, without express parliamentary approval, to meet EuropeanCommunity obligations. Smedley was thus applying in his own interest andin the interests of all British taxpayers and electors.
47The court held that he
had standing, although the challenge failed on its merits. A case to bedistinguished from the National Federation case is that of R v Attorney General ex
parte ICI plc (1986). In the ICIcase, the application was based on a complaint
that four competitor companies had been assessed at too lenient a rate,contrary to the Oil Taxation Act 1975. The court held that the company hadstanding: it had a genuine and substantial complaint. 
The judges are, however, not united in their approach to the ‘sufficient
interest’ test, which confers on the courts a great deal of discretion. In R v
Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Company Ltd(1990) ,Schiemann J cited a number of propositions which he deduced from
the IRC case. The Rose Theatre case concerned the question of whether a
company which had been incorporated for the purpose of campaigning tosave the historic Globe Theatre site in London had sufficient interest, or locus
standi. Included in the guidelines were that the question of whether sufficient
interest exists is not purely a matter within the discretion of the court; thatsufficient interest did not necessarily entail a direct financial or legal interest;that the assertion of an interest by a person or a group does not mean thatsufficient interest exists; and that, even where thousands of people joinedtogether in a campaign, that was not conclusive that sufficient interest existed.The court ruled that the company did not have sufficient interest.
48However,
in R v Poole Borough Council ex parte BeeBee (1991) ,the same judge ruled that
two pressure groups, The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the BritishHeperetological Society (BHS), had sufficient interest to challenge a decisionof the Council which had granted planning permission to itself for thedevelopment of a heathland with designated ‘special scientific interest’ status.The BHS had a financial interest in the site, and the WWF had undertaken topay any legal costs if necessary.
49
A liberal approach to sufficient interest was also taken in R v Secretary of
State for the Environment ex parte Greenpeace Ltd (No 2) (1994) .Greenpeace
applied for judicial review to challenge the decision of the Inspectorate ofPollution to allow the siting of a nuclear reprocessing plant (THORP) atChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
85447Per Sir John Donaldson MR.
48 And see Schiemann, 1990.
49 But for another decision denying sufficient interest to interest groups, see R v Darlington
Borough Council ex parte Association of Darlington Taxi Owners (1994).

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
Sellafield. It was held that the Inspectorate had not abused its powers in
varying British Nuclear Fuel plc’s licence. However, while Greenpeace lost thecase, the court nevertheless ruled that Greenpeace did have standing tochallenge the decision. It was in the interests of justice to allow Greenpeace –an organisation with over 400,000 supporters in the United Kingdom – tobring an action on behalf of all concerned with the project. The court declinedto follow the Rose Theatre decision, but warned that it should not be assumed
that Greenpeace or other pressure groups would automatically be held tohave sufficient interest in any future case. 
Further cases involving successful challenges by pressure groups are that
of R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte World
Development Movement Ltd (1995) (the EOC case) and R v Secretary of State for
the Environment ex parte the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (the RSPB
case) (1995). In the first case, the World Development Movement (WDM)sought judicial review of the Foreign Secretary’s decision to grant financial aidto Malaysia for the building of the Pergau dam. The WDM argued that theSecretary of State had exceeded his powers. The court held that the WDM hadsufficient interest. The WDM played a prominent role in giving advice andassistance in relation to aid and had consultative status with United Nation’sbodies. Further, it was unlikely that there would be any other person or bodywith sufficient interest to challenge the decision. In the EOC case, the Equal
Opportunities Commission (EOC) sought a declaration that the UnitedKingdom was in breach of European Community law obligations in relationto Article 119 (now Article 141) of the EC Treaty and Equal Pay and EqualTreatment Directives of the Community. The alleged breach concerned theEmployment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, which discriminatedbetween full time and part time employees in relation to redundancy pay andcompensation for unfair dismissal. The House of Lords confirmed that theEOC had sufficient interest and, moreover, that English law was incompatiblewith the requirements of European Community law. In the RSPB case, the
Royal Society had sufficient interest to challenge the decision of the Secretaryof State’s decision affecting the development of land which had hitherto beena special site for the conservation of birds. 
THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES
The availability of alternative remedies is a relevant factor in decidingwhether leave will be granted for judicial review. In R v Inland Revenue
Commissioners ex parte Preston (1985) ,Lord Templeman stated that leave for an
application for judicial review should not be granted ‘where an alternativeremedy was available’. Thus, by way of example, where parliament had setup under statute a comprehensive appeals structure, judicial review cannot beused as a means of circumventing this.
50Moreover, the statutory rights of
85550R v Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte Connolly (1986).

appeal must be exhausted.51If, however, there are exceptional circumstances
– for example, if inordinate delays are experienced in the proceedings – the
court may grant leave to apply for judicial review.52
A MATTER OF PUBLIC – NOT PRIVATE – LAW 
Judicial review is confined to matters of public – as opposed to private – law.The courts will not seize jurisdiction to review an administrative action ordecision if the matter involved is one of private law. Accordingly, therespondent must be a public authority, and the right at issue must be a publicright. If the matter is one of public law, the aggrieved person must apply byway of judicial review and not under any other procedure. 
The ‘exclusivity principle’
In O’Reilly v Mackman (1983) ,53the applicants had taken part in a prison riot at
Hull gaol and the Board of Visitors (who exercise disciplinary powers overprisoners) reduced the remission of sentence as punishment. The applicantstried to establish that the Board of Visitors had acted contrary to the rules ofnatural justice. This they attempted to do by means of an originatingsummons or writ.
54It was not contested that the issue was a matter of public
law and that they could have employed the judicial review procedure,provided that they applied for leave within the requisite three months. Noleave from the court is needed in relation to private law proceedings. Theissue for the court was whether it was an abuse of the process of the court touse the alternative basis to bring the action. Lord Diplock stated:
If what should emerge is that his complaint is not of an infringement of any of
his rights that are entitled to protection in public law, but may be aninfringement of his rights in private law and this is not a proper subject forjudicial review, the court has power under rule 9(5), instead of refusing theapplication, to order the proceedings to continue as if they had begun by writ... [pp 283–84]
Referring to the procedural disadvantages which had existed prior to the
reforms introduced in 1977 by Order 53,55Lord Diplock went on to state that:
... now that those disadvantages to applicants have been removed and all
remedies for infringement of rights protected by public law can be obtainedupon an application for judicial review, as also can remedies for infringementsof rights under private law if such infringement should also be involved, itwould in my view as a general rule be contrary to public policy, and as such anChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law

abuse of the process of the court to permit a person seeking to establish that a
decision of a public authority infringed rights to which he was entitled toprotection under public law to proceed by way of an ordinary action and bythis means evade the provisions of Order 53 for the protection of suchauthorities. [p 285]
The decision in O’Reilly has been trenchantly criticised by Professor HWR
Wade.56The ‘exclusivity principle’ – keeping public and private law rigidly
distinct – was introduced by Lord Diplock in O’Reilly , notwithstanding the
Law Commission’s intention that procedural reforms introduced in 1977 were
not intended to create a rigid distinction between public and private lawproceedings.
57Before that time, although the distinction between public and
private law was drawn, the system was not exclusive. Professor Wade regardsthe exclusivity principle, declared in O’Reilly , as amounting to a ‘serious
setback for administrative law’. He goes on to state that:
... it has caused many cases, which on their merits might have succeeded, to
fail merely because of choice of the wrong form of action ... It has producedgreat uncertainty, which seems likely to continue, as to the boundary betweenpublic and private law, since these terms have no clear or settled meaning ...[Wade and Forsyth, 1994, p 682]
Professor Wade regards this as an unnecessary restriction on access to the
courts, a restriction which has been avoided in Scotland, Australia, NewZealand and Canada. His assessment of the House of Lords’ decision inO’Reilly is that:
... the House of Lords has expounded the new law as designed for the
protection of public authorities rather than of the citizen. Such are themisfortunes which can flow from the best intentioned reforms.
Exceptions to the exclusivity principle
The harshness with which the exclusivity principle could operate, led Lord
Diplock in O’Reilly to state that exceptions to the rule would exist, where the
case involved both public and private law elements, particularly where thepublic law element was collateral (auxiliary or secondary) to the private lawelement. What is evident in this matter is that a balance needs to be struckbetween too rigid a rule, which denies individuals the protection of judicialreview, and too lax an approach, which would enable individuals either topursue a remedy in judicial review when other procedures are in fact moreappropriate or, conversely, to pursue other remedies when judicial reviewwould be appropriate, in order to evade the requirements of judicial review. Itis also evident that the judges are struggling to find the correct balance.

A public law issue used in defence in private law proceedings
In Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder (1985) ,the House of Lords
allowed a matter of public law (the lawfulness of the council’s decision) to be
used as a defence to private law proceedings (possession proceedings).Winder was a tenant of the local authority, which gave notice that rents wereto be raised. Winder claimed that the increase was unreasonable and contraryto law. The local authority brought an action for possession of the premises.Winder defended this action on the basis that the rent increase was outside thepowers of the local authority and void for unreasonableness. On appeal to theHouse of Lords, the question for the court was whether Winder couldchallenge the local authority’s action by way of a defence based on judicialreview grounds, or whether he should have instigated separate judicialreview proceedings by way of an application to the High Court. The localauthority submitted that Winder should have used judicial review but that,since he was by then out of time to do so, he could not challenge their decisionby way of a defence to the possession proceedings.
Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, citing O’Reilly, acknowledged that it was in the
interests of good administration to protect authorities from unmeritorious orlate challenges, but that this factor had to be weighed in the balance againstthe argument for preserving the ordinary rights of private citizens to defendthemselves against unfounded claims. In his opinion, Winder’s action couldnot be described as an abuse of the process of the court. Winder had notselected the procedure, he was merely seeking to defend himself. If the publicinterest required that people should not have the right to defend themselves,then that was a matter for parliament, not the courts.
Cases involving both public and private law issues
In Roy v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Family Practitioner Committee
(1992) ,a further exception to the exclusivity principle emerged, whereby the
House of Lords ruled that the principle did not apply where the proceedingsinvolved matters of both public and private law. In Roy, a Family Practitioner
Committee was responsible for making payments to general practitioners inrespect of their National Health Service work.
58Dr Roy’s allowance was
reduced by the committee on the basis that he had reduced the amount of histime spent on National Health Service work. Dr Roy litigated to recover thesum reduced. At first instance, the judge decided that the decision to reducehis payments was a matter of public law to be challenged under judicialreview proceedings. On appeal to the House of Lords, it was held that, when alitigant had a private law right – in relation to a matter which involved anissue of public law – he was not precluded from pursuing his private lawChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
85858 Under the National Health Service (General Medical and Pharmaceutical) Regulations
1974.

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
right. Accordingly, the fact that the public law issue could have been
determined under judicial review proceedings was not held to deny him aremedy under private law. In Andreou v Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales (1998), the applicant had been granted leave to bring
judicial review to challenge the validity of a bylaw of the Chartered Institute,but failed to observe the time limit. He then commenced a private law actionalleging breach of contractual duty to exercise its bylaw making powers fairlyand to act fairly in its disciplinary proceedings. The Court of Appeal ruledthat the Institute was, in part, a public body. However, here it was appropriateto proceed under private law since there was a private law right at issue, eventhough there was also a public law issue involved.
InR v Peter Edward Wicks (1997), the House of Lords ruled that the validity
of an enforcement notice under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990could not be impugned in criminal proceedings, but only by the High Courton an application for judicial review. The defendant appealed against theCourt of Appeal decision, dismissing his appeal against conviction for failureto comply with the enforcement notice. So long as the enforcement notice wasnot a nullity or patently defective on its face, it was valid and would remain sountil quashed. No criminal court had the power to quash, and it was not opento the defence to go behind the notice and seek to investigate its validity. Theproper course to take was to apply for an adjournment of the criminalproceedings and apply to the High Court for judicial review in which thevalidity of the notice could be attacked.
59
A challenge to the vires of subordinate legislation or an administrative act
could be raised in criminal proceedings. The House of Lords so held inBoddington v British Transport Police (1998). The defendant, in criminal
proceedings on charges of smoking a cigarette in a railway carriage wheresmoking was prohibited, sought to argue that the Network South Central’sdecision to post notices banning smoking was ultra vires its powers to bring
the relevant bylaw into force. On appeal, the court had ruled that it was notopen to the defendant to raise that public law defence in criminal proceedingsagainst him. The House of Lords, however, stated that a defendant was soentitled, and that, if the defendant managed to rebut the presumption infavour of the lawfulness of the subordinate legislation or administrative act,the legislation or act had no legal effect at all and could not found aprosecution. In the instant case, there was nothing in the bylaws or therelevant Act to rebut the presumption that the defendant was entitled todefend himself against a criminal charge on the basis of the validity of thedecision to put no smoking notices in carriages. However, the manner inwhich the relevant bylaw had been brought into force was not ultra vires and
accordingly the appeal was dismissed.

Broad versus restrictive approaches to standing
O’Reilly and Winder were both considered extensively in Roy v Kensington and
Chelsea and Westminster Family Practitioner Committee (above) ,in which Lord
Lowry examined the ‘broad’ or ‘liberal’ approach to judicial review and the
‘narrow’ or ‘restrictive’ approach. A broad approach lessens the importance ofthe distinction between public and private law and would allow either theOrder 53 procedure to be used or for the pursuit of a private law remedy. Anarrow approach, however, would dictate that if the matter is primarily amatter of private law then the judicial review procedure is inappropriate.While Lord Lowry ‘disclaimed any intention of discussing the scope of therule in O’Reilly’, he nevertheless went on to make a case for a more liberal
approach. Lord Lowry stated that:
... the Law Commission, when recommending the new judicial review
procedure, contemplated the continued co-existence of judicial reviewproceedings and actions for a declaration with regard to public law issues ...
... this House has expressly approved actions for a declaration of nullity as
alternative to applications for certiorari to quash, where private law rightswere concerned: Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder (1992), p 655, per
Robert Goff LJ.
Citing Goff LJ, Lord Lowry continued:
The principle remains in fact that public authorities and public servants are,unless clearly exempted, answerable in the ordinary courts for wrongs done toindividuals. But by an extension of remedies and a flexible procedure it can besaid that something resembling a system of public law is being developed.Before the expression ‘public law’ can be used to deny a subject a right ofaction in the court of his choice it must be related to a positive prescription oflaw, by statute or by statutory rules. We have not yet reached the point atwhich mere characterisation of a claim as a claim in public law is sufficient toexclude it from consideration by the ordinary courts: to permit this would beto create a dual system of law with the rigidity and procedural hardship forplaintiffs which it was the purpose of the recent reforms to remove’: Davy v
Spelthorn Borough Council (1984), per Lord Wilberforce.
In conclusion, my Lords, it seems to me that, unless the procedure adopted bythe moving party is ill suited to dispose of the question at issue, there is muchto be said in favour of the proposition that a court having jurisdiction ought tolet a case be heard rather than entertain a debate concerning the form of theproceedings.
Lord Slynn advanced the argument for a more flexible approach to the choice
of proceedings in Mercury Communications Ltd v Director General of
Telecommunications (1996). In that case, the effect of O’Reilly v Mackman was
further limited. A dispute arose between Mercury Communications andBritish Telecom (BT), both of which are public limited companies licenced bythe Secretary of State under the Telecommunications Act 1984. MercuryCommunications was dependent upon the rental of part of BT’s network. TheChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
860

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
Director General, exercising powers under the 1984 Act, determined the
dispute, and his decision affected the terms of the contract between Mercuryand BT. Mercury initiated private proceedings in the Commercial Court byoriginating summons. At first instance, the Director General and BT failed tohave the proceeding struck out, the court applying the O’Reilly principle. On
appeal, however, it was argued, successfully, that this was an abuse ofprocess. The case went to the House of Lords, which reversed the decision ofthe Court of Appeal. Lord Slynn emphasised that when determining the issueof the choice of private or public law proceedings, flexibility must be retained.It was recognised that the Director General had statutory functions andperformed public duties. However, this did not eliminate the possibility ofprivate law proceedings. Since the Director General’s decision had beenimposed as part of a contract, this could be regarded as a contractual dispute.Accordingly, the commencement of private law proceedings was equally wellsuited to determine the issue as judicial review proceedings. The issue of theappropriateness of proceedings was a matter to be determined by the courtson a case by case basis. Lord Slynn stated that:
... when it comes to a question of striking out for abuse of process of the court
the discretion exercised by the trial judge should stand unless the argumentsare clearly and strongly in favour of a different result to that to which he hascome. [p 59]
The House of Lords reconsidered the question of the appropriate form of
proceedings once more in O’Rourke v Camden London Borough Council (1997). In
this case, the plaintiff had applied to the local authority for accommodation,under the Housing Act 1985, on his release from prison. Section 63(1) of theHousing Act provides that a local authority is under a duty to provideaccommodation in respect of those who are ‘homeless and [had] a priorityneed’, and that includes persons who are ‘vulnerable as a result of ... physicaldisability or other special reason’. Initially, the authority refused himaccommodation, but subsequently provided accommodation for a 12 dayperiod, after which the plaintiff was evicted and no alternativeaccommodation offered. The plaintiff brought a private action against thecouncil for wrongful eviction without providing alternative accommodation,and claimed damages. The House of Lords ruled that the question of whethersection 63 of the Housing Act gave rise to public or private law proceedingsdepended on the intention of parliament. The duty to provide accommodationwas a matter of public law and the Act ‘was a scheme of social welfare,intended on grounds of public policy and public interest to confer benefits atthe public expense not only for the private benefit of people who foundthemselves homeless but also for the benefit of society in general’. Theprovision of accommodation, and the type of accommodation, was ‘largelydependent on the housing authority’s judgment and discretion’. Accordingly,it was ‘unlikely’ that parliament had intended section 63 to give rise to aprivate action. 
861

The issue of the choice between public and private proceedings returned
to the courts in Trustees of the Dennis Rye Pension Fund and Another v Sheffield
City Council (1997) .The plaintiffs were required by the local council to carry
out repairs to certain houses to make them fit for human habitation,60and
applied for improvement grants from the council under the Local
Government and Housing Act 1989. When the work was complete, thecouncil refused to pay the grant, on the basis that, inter alia, the repairs had not
been carried out to the required standard. The plaintiff then commencedprivate law proceedings for recovery of the money due. The council, however,argued that, if there were any grounds for complaint, the appropriate processwas an application for judicial review. Accordingly, the council sought tohave the plaintiff’s claim struck out, on the grounds that the private lawproceedings were an abuse of process. The issue went to the Court of Appeal.Lord Woolf MR regretted that the ‘tactical’ issue of the choice of proceedingshad inevitably led to very substantial costs being incurred ‘to little or nopurpose’. He further criticised the narrow approach taken by the House ofLords in O’Rourke v Camden London Borough Council . 
The Court of Appeal considered the choice between judicial review
proceedings and other legal action against a public authority. In determiningthat question, the court should not be overly concerned with the distinctionbetween public and private rights, but look to the practical consequences ofpursuing the alternative actions. The court accepted that when a council wasperforming its role in relation to the making of grants, it was performing apublic function which did not give rise to private rights. If the choice madehad ‘no significant disadvantages’ for the parties, the public or the courts, itshould not normally be regarded as an abuse of process. The court appliedO’Reilly v Mackman (1982) and Roy v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster
Family Practitioner Committee (1992). Lord Woolf MR, after a consideration of
these, and other cases, ruled that as a general rule it is contrary to publicpolicy, and as a result an abuse of the process of the court:
... to permit a person seeking to establish that a decision of a public authority
infringed rights to which he was entitled to protection under public law toproceed by way of an ordinary action and by this means to evade theprovisions of Order 53 for the protection of such authorities.
However, Lord Woolf made three ‘pragmatic suggestions’ and stated that it is
to be remembered that:
If it is not clear whether judicial review or an ordinary action is the correct
procedure it will be safer to make an application for judicial review thancommence an ordinary action since there then should be no question of beingtreated as abusing the process of the court by avoiding the protection providedby judicial review ...Chapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
86260 Under the Housing Act 1989, s 189.

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
If a case is brought by an ordinary action and there is an application to strike
out the case, the court should, at least if it is unclear whether the case shouldhave been brought by judicial review, ask itself whether, if the case had beenbrought by judicial review when the action was commenced, it is clear leavewould have been granted. If it would, then that is at least an indication thatthere has been no harm to the interests judicial review is designed to protect ...
Finally, in cases where it is unclear whether proceedings have been correctly
brought by an ordinary action, it should be remembered that, after consultingthe Crown Office, a case can always be transferred to the Crown Office List asan alternative to being struck out.
61
The more liberal approach to procedure was evident in Clark v University of
Lincolnshire and Humberside (2000) in which a student sued her University for
breach of contract after having been failed in her examination following
unproven allegations of plagiarism. She was outside the three month timelimit for judicial review and the University argued that this would have beenthe appropriate form of proceeding. The Court of Appeal disagreed, statingthat the distinction between judicial review and private actions was nowlimited and that a claim would not be struck out on the basis that theapplicant had proceeded under contract rather than judicial review.
REMEDIES62
Introduction
The granting of a remedy in judicial review proceedings is at the discretion ofthe court. Even where the applicant establishes his or her case, the court mayrefuse a remedy if there has been a delay in commencing proceedings, or if theapplicant has acted unreasonably, or where the public interest in efficientadministration could be damaged by the granting of a remedy. The availableremedies under public law are the ‘prerogative remedies’ of certiorari,prohibition and mandamus, now renamed quashing orders, prohibitingorders and mandatory orders. In addition, under private law there are theremedies of declaration and injunction, which may also be granted underjudicial review proceedings.
Certiorari: ‘quashing order’
This remedy overlaps with that of prohibition (below). An order of certiorari –or quashing order – is one which ‘quashes’ the original decision: accordingly itis both negative and retrospective in nature: R v Criminal Injuries Compensation
86361Trustees of the Dennis Rye Pension Fund and Another v Sheffield City Council (1997), p 755.
62 The orders were renamed under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, para 54.1. See Oliver,
2001.

Board ex parte Lain (1967); O’Reilly v Mackman (1983). The classic dictum is that
of Lord Atkin:63
... whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine
questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially,act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to the controllingjurisdiction of the King’s Bench Division exercised in these writs. 
Prohibition: ‘prohibiting order’
Prohibition is an order which prevents a body from making a decision which
would be capable of being quashed by certiorari. It is thus protective innature. Neither certiorari nor prohibition lie against decisions of the highercourts. 
Mandamus: ‘mandatory order’
This order is one which compels an authority to act. A mandatory order doesnot lie against an authority which has complete discretion to act. A failure tocomply with the order amounts to a contempt of court. Mandatory orders dolie against the Crown, and may be used to enforce action by a minister orofficial.
Declarations
A declaration is a statement of the legal position of the parties, and is notaccordingly a remedy per se . Although lacking coercive force, public bodies
will respond to a declaration and comply with its terms by rectifying itsactions. Declarations are available against the Crown.
Injunctions
Injunctions may be interim or permanent, and positive or negative.Injunctions may be used to prevent a minister or administrative body fromacting unlawfully. In M v Home Office (1993), the House of Lords held that
injunctions could lie against ministers of the Crown, and that breach of aninjunction could lead to a minister, in his official capacity as representative ofthe Crown, being held in contempt of court. See, further, Chapters 6 and 11.
Damages
An applicant for judicial review may be awarded damages in conjunctionwith one of the other remedies. Damages will only be awarded if they wouldChapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law

(1924).

Judicial Review: Introduction, Jurisdiction and Procedure
have been recoverable had the applicant begun an action by writ (that is, a
private law action). 
DEFAULT POWERS
Statute may provide that a minister has powers to act in order to oblige adecision making body to comply with their statutory duty. For example,section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 provided that the Secretary of State hadthe power to give directions to local authorities to comply with their statutoryduty to provide adequate sites for Gypsies residing in, or resorting to theirarea.
64Other examples of similar powers are found in the Public Health Act
1936, the Education Act 1944, the National Health Service Act 1977, theHousing Act 1985, the Local Government Act 1985 and the Town and CountryPlanning Act 1990. In respect of the Housing Act provisions, in R v Secretary of
State for the Environment ex parte Norwich City Council (1982), the Secretary of
State had the power to act as he ‘thinks necessary’ to ensure that tenants areable to exercise their ‘right to buy’ from local authorities. His failure to enforcethe local authorities’ duty was itself subject to the control of the courtsthrough judicial review. Default powers are a backstop, but an importantweapon in ensuring that local authorities and other bodies comply with therequirements of statute.
Remedies and the Human Rights Act 1998
Section 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 authorises a court to ‘grant such reliefor remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just andappropriate’. Accordingly, any remedies which a particular court may awardare available for breaches of Convention rights. Declarations, damages,injunctions or the prerogative orders are available. When awarding damages,the courts must take into account the principles applied by the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights in relation to awards of compensation. Claims fordamages do not lie against the decision of a court which has breached theConvention, even though courts are defined as public bodies under the Act.Section 9 of the 1998 Act requires that proceedings against a first instancecourt be brought by way of appeal or by judicial review. An exception to thisis provided in section 9(3) and (4), which provide for awards of damagesagainst the Crown where any judicial body has been guilty of a breach ofArticle 5 (the right to liberty). Where there has been a breach of a Conventionright caused by an Act of Parliament, damages cannot be awarded. In thissituation, the consequence will be the making of a declaration ofincompatibility. Only the High Court and courts above have the power toissue declarations of incompatibility. 
86564 The duty to provide sites has been repealed: Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994, s 80.

Judicial review as an adequate remedy has been criticised by the Court of
Human Rights in Z v United Kingdom (2001) and Kingsley v United Kingdom
(2002), discussed at p 920 and Chapter 19.Chapter 24: Constitutional and Administrative Law
866

867CHAPTER 25
With the procedural aspects of judicial review proceedings in mind, attention
can now be turned to the grounds on which judicial review may be sought.Two principal classes of action may be pursued: those which allege that therehas been a breach of statutory requirements, and those alleging that a decisionhas been reached in an unreasonable manner or in disregard of the rules ofnatural justice. These broad headings have traditionally been divided into anumber of subheadings. In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister of State for
Civil Service (1985) (the GCHQ case), the House of Lords took the opportunity
to offer a rationalisation of the grounds for judicial review and ruled that thebases for judicial review could be subsumed under three principal heads,namely, illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. It was acceptedthat further grounds for review, such as ‘proportionality’ might emerge. LordDiplock elucidated the concepts: 
By ‘illegality’ as a ground for judicial review, I mean that the decision maker
must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making powerand give effect to it. Whether he had or not is par excellence a justiciable
question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, bywhom the judicial power of the State is exercisable.
By ‘irrationality’, I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury
unreasonableness.
1It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its
defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who
had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.Whether a decision falls within this category is a question that judges by theirtraining and experience should be well equipped to answer ...
I have described the third head as ‘procedural impropriety’ rather than failure
to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with proceduralfairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision. This isbecause susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure byan administrative tribunal to observe the procedural rules that are expresslylaid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred,even though such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice.
That is not to say that further development on a case by case basis may not in
course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possibleadoption in the future of the principle of ‘proportionality’ which is recognisedin the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European[Economic] Community ... [pp 410–11]
The court’s attitude to proportionality is discussed later in this chapter, when
consideration is given to the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporatesTHE GROUNDS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

below, p 870 ff.

European Convention rights into domestic law. It is important, however, to
acknowledge at this stage that the traditional approach to judicial review –outlined below – is changing markedly, led by the influence of European lawunder the law of the European Community and by the Convention on HumanRights. Depending particularly on how the law develops under the HumanRights Act 1998, it may well prove that judicial review, as hithertounderstood, is undergoing fundamental change.
THE TRADITIONAL DOCTRINE OF ULTRA VIRES
Ultra vires refers to action which is outside – or in excess of – powers of
decision making bodies. While judges continue to use the term ultra vires , it is
nowadays too limited a term to encompass the whole ambit of judicial review.It may be preferable, therefore, to regard judicial review as the control ofdiscretion and the regulation of the decision making process by the courts. Byway of example, in R v Hull University Visitor ex parte Page (1993), Lord
Browne-Wilkinson adopted the traditional language of ultra vires:
If the decision maker exercises his powers outside the jurisdiction conferred, in
a manner which is procedurally irregular or is Wednesbury unreasonable, he is
acting ultra vires his powers and therefore unlawfully. 
Two cases illustrate this rule. In R v Richmond upon Thames Council ex parte
McCarthy and Stone Ltd (1992), the local planning authority implemented a
scheme of charging £25.00 for informal consultation between corporation
officers and property developers. The House of Lords held that the impositionof the charge was unlawful. Such a charge was neither incidental to theplanning function of the local authority, nor could a charge be levied on thepublic without statutory authority. The council had misconstrued its powersand, accordingly, acted ultra vires. Further, in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham
Council (1992), the council attempted to increase its revenue through financial
investments which, for success, were dependent upon the fluctuation ininterest rates. The House of Lords ruled that the council had no power to enterinto ‘interest rate swaps’ which were purely speculative in nature. Suchspeculation was inconsistent with the statutory borrowing powers conferredon local authorities and neither conducive to nor incidental to the exercise ofthose powers. 
Difficulties with the traditional ultra vires doctrine2
The ultra vires principle is consistent with the doctrine of parliamentary
sovereignty and, to some extent, with the concept of the rule of law. However,there are objections to the courts holding so tenaciously to a concept which, inChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
8682 See Laws, ‘Illegality: the problem of jurisdiction’, in Supperstone and Goudie, 1988,
Chapter 4.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
some respects, is inappropriate to describe what the courts actually do in the
control of administrative powers.3The judges cling to the ultra vires doctrine
as a means of protecting their constitutional position. As has been seen inChapters 5 and 7, the judges are not entrusted with constitutional powers toinvalidate Acts of Parliament, and judicial decisions are susceptible to beingoverruled by Acts of Parliament.
4With the supremacy of parliament in mind,
the judges exercise care to maintain a sufficient separation of powers. It is forthis reason that judges are cautious about reviewing the exercise ofprerogative powers and limit their role in relation to parliamentary privilegesto ruling on the existence and scope of privilege. Keen awareness of thisconstitutional position explains the hold which the traditional doctrine of ultra
vires has for judges. Ultra vires is entirely consistent with the supremacy of
parliament and the rule of law. However, the doctrine of ultra vires cannot
explain adequately the judges’ power to rule, as they do, on certain aspects ofdecision making. While the judges declare that matters of ‘high policy’ are notfor them to decide, when judges rule on ‘unreasonableness’ or, as LordDiplock classifies the concept, ‘irrationality’, the judges come close to rulingon the merits of a particular decision. Furthermore, as shall be seen below, theconcept of ‘error of law’ fits uneasily with the concept of ultra vires. 
For reasons such as these, the concept of ultra vires is nowadays regarded
by many as an inadequate rationale for judicial review. The preferred view isthat the courts need not resort to fictions such as the ‘intention of parliament’or the technicalities of ‘jurisdictional facts’ and ‘errors of law’ (on which, seebelow), but that rather the courts will intervene wherever there has been anunlawful exercise of power. As Dawn Oliver expresses the matter, ‘judicialreview has moved on from the ultra vires rule to a concern for the protection of
individuals, and for the control of power’.
5
Traditional terminological and classificatory difficulties in
judicial review
While Lord Diplock, in the GCHQ case, offered a rationalisation of the
headings of review, the question of terminology and classification remains
difficult and sometimes obscure. This problem should be recognised at theoutset. It should also be borne in mind that the categories are by no meanswatertight and discrete: in many instances, there will appear overlapsbetween the headings. By way of illustration, a decision maker may act ultra
vires by taking into account irrelevant considerations. Depending upon the
magnitude of the irrelevant consideration, he or she may also be actingirrationally.

analysis, see Joseph, 2001.

Irrationality: Wednesbury unreasonableness
Acting for improper motives, failing to take account of relevant
considerations, failing to respect the requirements of natural justice andfettering a discretion by adopting a rigid policy will all amount tounreasonableness as understood by the courts. The term ‘unreasonableness’may thus be seen as an ‘umbrella concept’ which subsumes all the majorheadings of review. 
‘Irrationality’ is a concept which takes the courts further from reviewing
the procedures by which a decision has been made and testing its legality, andcloser to substituting the court’s own view of the merits of the decision. Theterms ‘irrationality’ and ‘ Wednesbury unreasonableness’ appear to be used at
the judge’s own preference.
6Alternative expressions such as ‘arbitrary and
capricious’, ‘frivolous or vexatious’ and ‘capricious and vexatious’ are alsoused on occasion to express the same concept.
7‘Acting perversely’ has also
been used to judicially express the idea of unreasonableness.8
Early expression was given to the concept in two cases, Rooke’s Case (1598)
and Keighley’s Case (1609). In Rooke’s Case , Coke LJ proclaimed:
... and notwithstanding the words of the commission give authority to the
commissioners to do according to their discretions, yet their proceedings oughtto be limited and bound with the rule of reason and law. For discretion is ascience or understanding to discern between falsity and truth, between wrongand right, between shadows and substances, between equity and colourableglosses and pretences, and not to do according to their wills and privateaffections ...
The classic case of more recent times is that of Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation (1948). The local authority had the power
to grant licences for the opening of cinemas subject to such conditions as the
authority ‘thought fit’ to impose. The authority, when granting a Sundaylicence, imposed a condition that no children under the age of 15 years shouldbe admitted. The applicants argued that the imposition of the condition wasunreasonable and ultra vires the corporation’s powers. The authority argued
that there were no limits on the conditions which could be imposed in thestatute. Lord Greene MR alluded to the many grounds of attack which couldbe made against a decision, citing unreasonableness, bad faith, dishonesty,paying attention to irrelevant circumstances, disregard of the proper decisionmaking procedure and held that each of these could be encompassed withinthe umbrella term ‘unreasonableness’. The test propounded in that case wasChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
8706 See, eg, Lord Donaldson MR in R v Devon County Council ex parte G (1989), p 577.
7PerWade and Forsyth, 1994, p 391 and references therein.
8PerLord Brightman in R v Hillingdon London Borough Council ex parte Pulhofer (1986). The
test of Wednesbury unreasonableness is the foundation of the jurisdiction of University
Visitors, who should only intervene in academic matters in exceptional circumstances:
Jhamat v Inns of Court School of Law (Visitors to the Inns of Court) (1999).

The Grounds for Judicial Review
whether an authority had acted, or reached a decision, in a manner ‘so
unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it’:
Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation to exercise
of statutory discretion often use the word ‘unreasonable’ in a rathercomprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as ageneral description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a personentrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law.He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider.He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to whathe has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, andoften is said, to be acting ‘unreasonably’. Similarly, there may be something soabsurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powersof the authority ... 
The court is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority with a view
to seeing whether they have taken into account matters which they ought notto take into account, or, conversely, have refused to take into account and oncethat question is answered in favour of the local authority, it may still bepossible to say that, although the local authority have kept within the fourcorners of the matters which they ought to consider, they have neverthelesscome to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could everhave come to it. In such a case, again, I think the court can interfere. [p 229]
‘Unreasonableness’ was employed to challenge a bylaw which prohibited
singing ‘in any public place or highway within fifty yards of any dwellinghouse’ although, on the merits of the case, the challenge failed.
9In Roberts v
Hopwood (1925), the council, in adopting a policy of paying higher wages than
the national average for its workers, was unreasonable, for the discretion ofthe council was limited by law – it was not free to pursue a socialist policy atthe expense of its rate payers. The House of Lords ruled that, irrespective ofthe wording of the statute, the council had a duty to act ‘reasonably’; itsdiscretion was limited by law.
10
The standard of reasonableness imposed by the courts is high: to impose
too low a standard would in effect mean the substitution of judicial discretionfor administrative discretion. It is for this reason that Lord Greene, citedabove, states that a decision is unreasonable if it is ‘so absurd that no sensibleperson could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority’, andLord Diplock, in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service
(1985) ,regarded unreasonableness as entailing a decision ‘... so outrageous in
its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible personwho had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived atit’. 
In Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough
Council (1977) ,the Secretary of State for Education directed a newly elected

local authority to implement plans, devised by the predecessor council, to
introduce comprehensive schooling and abolish grammar schools.11At the
election, there had been a change in the political composition of the council,which resulted in the change of policy. The Secretary of State’s power was todirect an authority as to the exercise of its powers if he was satisfied that theauthority was acting unreasonably. The Secretary of State argued that the newcouncil would not be able to organise the necessary system of selective entryrequired for grammar schools in time for the new academic year, and that theauthority was therefore unreasonable. 
The matter went to the House of Lords. The court had to determine the
extent of the Secretary of State’s discretion under section 68 of the EducationAct. The wording of the section was subjective: ‘... if the Secretary of State issatisfied.’ It fell to the court to determine whether, in the circumstances of thecase, the Secretary of State had acted lawfully according to the court’sinterpretation of whether the Secretary of State did in fact have reasonablegrounds for believing that the authority had acted unreasonably. Applyingthe Wednesbury reasonableness test to the decision of the local authority to
retain grammar schools, the House of Lords ruled that the authority had notbeen unreasonable and, as a result, the Secretary of State’s directions wereunlawful. 
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Brind (1991) ,the
House of Lords re-examined the reasonableness of the exercise of the HomeSecretary’s discretion to issue a notice banning the transmission of speech byrepresentatives of the Irish Republican Army and its political party, Sinn Fein .
Despite the issue involving a denial of freedom of expression, the court ruledthat the exercise of the Home Secretary’s power
12did not amount to an
unreasonable exercise of discretion. 
In R v Radio Authority ex parte Bull (1995),Amnesty International (British
section) sought judicial review of the Radio Authority’s decision to refuse toaccept advertisements ‘inserted by or on behalf of any body whose objects arewholly or mainly of a political nature’ or an advertisement which ‘is directedtowards any political end’ under section 92(2)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 1990.The Divisional Court ruled that the authority had a wide measure ofdiscretion and that the court would not interfere with its decision so long as itwas not unreasonable. The Court ruled, further, that Article 10 of theEuropean Convention did not significantly affect the construction of section92; that the authority had to strike a balance between competing interestsincluding freedom of speech; that the authority’s interpretation had been inaccordance with the purposes of the Act.
In R v Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority ex parte S (1999), the Court of
Appeal, dismissing an appeal from an application for judicial review, ruledChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
87211 Under powers conferred by the Education Act 1944, s 68.
12 Under the Broadcasting Act 1981. See, further, Chapter 19.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
that the hospital’s policy of conducting routine and random searches of
patients without their consent was lawful. The applicants had claimed that thepower to search could not be implied into the Mental Health Act 1983, andthat, if such power existed, it was irrational and its exercise unlawfullyfettered the hospital’s discretion because it was not subject to any exception onmedical grounds. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of an impliedpower of search, ruling that it was consistent with a ‘self-evident and pressingneed’
13to enable the hospital to fulfil its primary function of treating patients
and ensuring a safe and therapeutic environment for both patients and staff.Since the hospital’s policy was in the interests of all, it had to be permitted tooverride medical objections raised in individual cases.
14
In R v National Lottery Commission ex parte Camelot Group plc (2000),
following Lloyd v McMahon (1987) and Doody (1994), the High Court ruled on
procedural fairness, holding that a decision to carry on exclusive negotiationswith only one of the two rival bidders for a licence to run the National Lotterywas unlawful. While there was a wide discretion under National Lottery Act1998, the decision was conspicuously unfair to Camelot.
Onerous conditions attached to decision
A decision by an authority may also be unreasonable if conditions areattached to the decision which are difficult or impossible to perform. Forexample, in Pyx Granite Co Ltd v Ministry of Housing and Local Government
(1958), Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal held that planningconditions ‘... must fairly and reasonably relate to the permitted development’and must not be so unreasonable that it can be said that parliament clearlycannot have intended that they should be imposed.
Accordingly, in the Pyx Granite case, the condition that permission be
conditional upon the company constructing a road ancillary to thedevelopment at its own expense when so required by the authority and togrant a public right of passage over it was ultra vires. Pyx Granite was followed
in Hall and Co Ltd v Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council and Another (1964).
The defendant council granted planning permission for a development,subject to conditions, which included the requirement to construct an ancillaryroad over the entire frontage of the site and subject to the right of publicpassage. While the objective of the council was viewed as ‘reasonable’, theterms of the conditions requiring the plaintiffs to construct a road at their ownexpense, for public use and without compensation, were not reasonable. Theultra vires conditions were fundamental to the whole planning permission

(1994).
14 See, also, R v Lord Saville of Newdigate ex parte B (No 2) (1999), and R (Daly) v Secretary of
State for the Home Department (2001), discussed in Chapter 19 at p 653 and below, p 890.

which was, accordingly, void. Equally, in R v Hillingdon London Borough
Council ex parte Royco Homes Ltd (1974), planning permission was also tied to
conditions. The conditions were that Royco Homes make properties
constructed available for occupation by those on the council’s housing waitinglist and, further, that for ten years the houses be occupied by persons subjectto security of tenure under the Rent Acts. The conditions were unreasonableand ultra vires.
According to Lord Widgery CJ, the conditions represented:
... the equivalent of requiring the applicants to take on at their own expense a
significant part of the duty of the council as housing authority. However wellintentioned and however sensible such a desire on the part of the council mayhave been, it seems to me that it is unreasonable ... [p 732]
Where an authority makes a decision which is in part good, but in part bad –
perhaps because of attaching onerous conditions to planning permission – thecourt may either invalidate the entire decision or sever the bad part of thedecision from the good. The decision in Agricultural Horticultural and Forestry
Industry Training Board v Aylesbury Mushrooms Ltd (1972) illustrates the
principle. There, the Training Board was under a mandatory statutory duty toconsult certain organisations and trades unions before reaching a decision.The Board failed to consult the Mushroom Growers Association. The courtheld that the decision was good, and could remain, in relation to thoseassociations which had been consulted, but bad in relation to the MushroomGrowers Association, and that the Board had a duty to reconsider theirdecision after consultations with the Association. 
In some cases, it will not be possible to sever a part of a decision from the
whole decision, in which case, the entire decision may be invalidated.
15For
example, in Director of Public Prosecutions v Hutchinson (1990), the local
authority passed a bylaw which prohibited unauthorised access to GreenhamCommon air force base. The Act of Parliament, under which the authoritypurported to exercise its powers, provided that no bylaw should be passedwhich affected the rights of registered commoners in the area. In an action fortrespass against anti-nuclear protesters, the defendants pleaded the invalidityof the bylaw. The House of Lords ruled that the bylaw was invalid and, as aresult, the protesters escaped conviction for trespass. 
Errors of law and errors of fact16
The problem concerning the role of the courts and the extent to which it isappropriate for there to be judicial intervention in administration, discussed inChapter 24, is clearly illustrated in relation to errors of law and errors of fact.The question for determination is whether, and to what extent, administratorsChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
87415 As in Hall and Co Ltd v Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council and Another , discussed
above.
16 See Yeats, ‘Errors of fact: the role of the courts law’, in Richardson and Genn, 1994.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
enjoy a measure of discretion in decision making, which empowers them to
make determinations of fact which are immune from judicial review. Beforeconsidering the courts approach, it is necessary to define the terms error oflaw and error of fact. 
An error of law may take several forms. An authority may wrongly
interpret a word to which a legal meaning is attributed. For example, wherean authority is under a duty to provide ‘accommodation’, the question arisesas to whether the quality of what they have, in fact, provided amounts, in law,to accommodation. Does the accommodation have to be of a particularquality, or be particularly suited to what the applicant needs?
17Questions
may also arise as to whether there has been a legal exercise of power inrelation to the objectives of relevant legislation, or whether a discretion hasbeen properly exercised, or whether relevant considerations have been takeninto account, or irrelevant considerations excluded from the decision makingprocess. An error of law will be reviewed by the courts. An error of fact is anerror which the courts will be more reluctant to review. Administrators aregiven powers to exercise in relation to their specialised area, and it is thedecision maker who has all the factual information to hand on which to base adecision. For the courts to intervene in this matter, would – unless somecaution is exercised – amount to the courts taking over the very role of theadministrators. Nevertheless, there may be some errors of fact which are ofsuch a fundamental nature that they cause a decision to be unlawful. Ian Yeatsoffers the following illustrative example of the role of fact in administrativedecision making. He writes:
In the simplest situations, the facts which have to be found and the law which
has to be determined can be presented as a series of preconditions which haveto exist before the duty can be performed or the power exercised. A board isempowered (or obliged) to take some action in respect of ‘dilapidated dwellinghouses in Greater London’. The ability (or duty) to act in respect of a particularbuilding depends on establishing that it is (1) in Greater London, (2) a dwellinghouse and (3) dilapidated. If the board finds that the three conditions aresatisfied, it may (or must) proceed. If it finds that any one of them is notsatisfied, then it cannot.
A disgruntled property owner invites a court to review the board’s findings:
the court has to decide whether, and how far, it should defer to the board’sviews. If the complaint is that the premises are not in Greater London, thecourt is likely to intervene. The question defines in the most literal way thearea in which the board has competence, can easily be resolved by a court, andis unlikely to occur frequently. The question is not about the correctness of thedecision on the building’s fate, but about whether the board whose decision isunder review had the function of determining it. If the complaint is that thehouse is not dilapidated, the court will be reluctant to intervene. That is aquestion involving elements of judgment which naturally appear to have beenremitted to the board and which it, rather than the court, has the facilities and
87517 See R v Hillingdon London Borough Council ex parte Pulhofer (1986).

probably the specialised expertise to answer; if the court were to agree to
answer it, every decision of the board would be potentially reviewable. If thecomplaint is that the premises do not constitute a dwelling house, the issue isless clear-cut. The court might think it proper to impose its view, partlybecause the problem might be posed in a narrowly legal form, that ofidentifying the correct sense in which the expression ‘dwelling house’ wasused in the legislation. [pp 131–32]
When the court considers whether there has been an error of law, it is seeking
to discover the correct definition of the legal words in the relevant statute.When the court is considering whether there has been an error of fact, thecourt is trying to determine whether the facts of the case ‘fit’ with theinterpretation of the statute. 
Historically, the judges have assumed the power to adjudicate on matters
which are termed ‘errors on the face of the record’. Errors on the face of therecord – that is to say, evidence from the documentation that the decisionmaker has made a wrong decision in law – will cause the judges to rule thatthe decision was defective, even if the decision maker was acting insidejurisdiction ( intra vires ). Such a power does not sit easily alongside the concept
of ultra vires, the very basis of which is to strike down decisions which have
been taken ultra vires (outside jurisdiction). 
As has been seen, if an authority is to act intra vires, it must conduct itself
according to a correct interpretation of the law. However, what is of theessence in relation to error of law is that the authority misinterprets ormisunderstands the powers which it has been granted and, accordingly, actsultra vires whereas, when an authority uses powers for the wrong purpose, the
authority has correctly interpreted its powers but used them towards thewrong objective. As has been said, an error of law may manifest itself inseveral ways. It may be that an authority misinterprets its legal powers, as inPerilly v Tower Hamlets Borough Council (1973) ,where the local authority
believed – erroneously – that it was obliged to consider applications for stalllicences in a street market in the order in which they were received. The effectof this was to deny a licence to Perilly even though his mother, by thendeceased, had held a licence for some 30 years. The licence granted to anincoming applicant in preference to Perilly was set aside by the court. 
The seminal case is that of Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission
(1969), discussed in Chapter 24. It will be recalled that the House of Lordsheld the decision of the Commission to be ultra vires. The decision made by
the Commission was so wrong that, in law, it did not amount to a decision atall. As a result, the section preventing the questioning of the Commission’sdecision in a court of law was not relevant or binding on the court, for theruling of the Commission – being so wrong in law – resulted in theCommission acting outside its jurisdiction, and nothing in the Act prohibiteda court of law from reviewing what was, in law and in effect, a nullity. TheHouse of Lords ruled that:Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
876

The Grounds for Judicial Review
If the inferior tribunal, as a result of its misconstruing the statutory description
of the kind of case in which it has jurisdiction to inquire, makes a purporteddetermination in a case of a kind into which it has no jurisdiction to inquire, itspurported determination is a nullity.
Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission destroyed the distinction
between errors of law which ‘went to jurisdiction’ (that is, deprived the
decision making body of power to determine the question) and errors of lawwithin jurisdiction. In Anisminic, the House of Lords ruled that, in effect, the
old distinctions were obsolete in relation to the decisions of administrativeand other bodies (but not necessarily inferior courts of law).
18Lord Diplock
has reasserted his support for this view in Re Racal Communications Ltd (1981)
and O’Reilly v Mackmann (1983). In the former case, Lord Diplock confirmed
the ‘breakthrough’ achieved in Anisminic . In O’Reilly, Lord Diplock went
further and asserted that the distinction had been rendered obsolete inrelation both to tribunals and inferior courts. This approach was confirmed bythe House of Lords in R v Hull University Visitor ex parte Page (1993). Professor
HWR Wade’s evaluation of these cases is that ‘it is clear now that they madean important extension of judicial review in English law ...’.
19
The House of Lords returned to the questions of jurisdictional errors in R v
Monopolies and Mergers Commission ex parte South Yorkshire Transport Ltd (1993).
Under section 64(1)(a) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Secretary of State haspower to refer a merger of companies to the Monopolies and MergersCommission (MMC). The jurisdiction of the MMC was to consider mergerswhich result in more than 25 per cent of services being supplied by onecompany ‘in a substantial part of the United Kingdom’. The merger betweentwo bus companies resulted in services being provided in an area whichcomprised 1.65 per cent of the United Kingdom, with a population of 3.2 percent of the total United Kingdom population. The companies sought judicialreview of the MMC’s investigation, on the basis that the facts relating to theland area did not amount to a ‘substantial part of the United Kingdom’. TheHouse of Lords found in favour of the MMC. The court ruled that the MMChad directed itself properly as to the meaning of ‘substantial’. However, it wasalso recognised that what amounted to ‘substantial’ could be interpreted indifferent ways, and that persons might reasonably disagree about thatinterpretation. Lord Mustill ruled that, in such a situation, a decision wouldonly be ruled unlawful if the decision ‘is so aberrant that it cannot be classedas rational’. Thus, where the statute provides broad criteria, over the meaningof which reasonable persons might reasonably disagree, the court will be slowto step in and substitute its judgment, unless the decision maker’s decisionfalls outside what the court regards as a reasonable interpretation of a wordwhich is essentially imprecise. 
87718 See Diplock, 1974; Wade, 1969; Gould, 1970; Gordon, 1971.
19 Wade and Forsyth, 1994, p 304.

Applying the South Yorkshire case, the Court of Appeal in R v Ministry of
Defence ex parte Walker (1999) ruled that the court should respect a Ministry’s
interpretation of what constituted military activity for the purpose of
excluding soldiers from criminal injuries compensation for injuries while inservice. Only if the interpretation was irrational would the court intervene,and there was no irrationality in choosing to exclude from the scheme afeature peculiar to army life abroad. There was also no unfairness in nothaving informed soldiers going into active service of the exclusionary rule.
Errors of fact raise difficult questions. As has been seen, an error of law
will be made when the decision maker acts contrary to the requirements oflegality – or, in other words, he has broken one of the rules for lawful decisionmaking. Errors of fact are more complex. If a decision maker bases hisdecision on a misunderstanding of the factual situation of the case, he willreach a decision which is wrong. The question which then arises is whetherthe courts will review such an error in judicial review proceedings. In general,the answer to that question is that the courts will be very cautious. After all,the courts will often not have the expertise to assess the factual situation, andmay have great difficulty in deciding whether a factual error has resulted inthe wrong decision. The courts have traditionally approached this matter bydividing errors of fact into two categories. The first relates to reviewable errorsof facts, which are jurisdictional, and the other category is that of non-reviewable, non-jurisdictional facts. 
Professor Wade illustrates a jurisdictional fact as follows:
A rent tribunal ... may have power to reduce the rent of a dwelling house. If it
mistakenly finds that the property is a dwelling house when in fact it is let forbusiness purposes, and then purports to reduce the rent, its order will be ultra
vires and void, for its jurisdiction depends upon the facts which must exist
objectively before the tribunal has power to act. [Wade and Forsyth, 1994,p 286]
On the other hand, other mistakes will not have this effect. Professor Wade
illustrates as follows:
Many facts on the other hand will not be jurisdictional, since they will have no
bearing on the limits of the power. A rent tribunal’s findings as to the state ofrepair of the property, the terms of the tenancy, and the defaults of landlord ortenant will probably not affect its jurisdiction in any way and will therefore beimmune from jurisdictional challenge. [p 287]
The question to be asked, therefore, is whether the mistake of fact is one which
is central to the decision maker’s power of decision. Only such crucial errorsof fact will be reviewed by the court. In addition, if a decision is reached onthe basis of facts for which there is no evidence, or based on essential factswhich have been proven wrong, or been misunderstood or ignored, the courtwill quash the decision (p 320).
Two cases further illustrate the courts’ approach to law and fact, and
demonstrate that the judges will – depending upon the circumstances of theChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
878

The Grounds for Judicial Review
case – adopt either a strict approach or a more lenient approach to the matter.
InR v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Khawaja (1984) ,the
House of Lords was required to rule on two questions. The first question waswhether the phrase ‘illegal immigrant’ in the Immigration Act 1971, covered aperson who had been granted permission to enter the country through fraudor deception as well as a person who secretly entered the country without anyleave. On this point, the House of Lords held that it could. The secondquestion concerned the standard of proof which the immigration officer hadto apply. It was argued that the correct standard to be applied was whetherthe immigration officer had reasonable grounds for his decision. The House ofLords rejected that view, holding that, because the liberty of the person wasinvolved, the standard of proof that deception had taken place was one of ahigh degree of probability. 
In R v Hillingdon London Borough Council ex parte Pulhofer (1986), the House
of Lords approached the matter rather differently. Under the Housing Act1985,
20local authorities are under a duty to provide accommodation for
homeless persons as defined by the Act. For the purposes of their decision, theHouse of Lords had to interpret the meaning of ‘accommodation’. The Houseof Lords adopted a very broad interpretation of the word, refusing to import astandard of reasonableness of accommodation which would protect theindividual from being placed in unsuitable housing. Unlike the decision inKhawaja, where the House of Lords introduced a standard of proof which was
protective of the individual against the administration, in Pulhofer, the court’s
ruling protected the administration – the housing authority – and not theindividual. The Housing and Planning Act 1986 reverses the House of Lords’decision in Pulhofer , and requires that ‘accommodation’ be accommodation
which it is reasonable for a person to continue to occupy. It can be seen fromthese two cases, that the interpretation of the question of law can dictate avery different outcome, depending upon the judicial approach taken. 
When the issue concerns individual rights, for example, the courts will be
slow to adopt an approach which has the effect of delimiting those rights. Tan
Te Lam and Others v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre and Another(1996), decided by the Privy Council, illustrates the point well.
21The
applicants were detainees in Hong Kong, having arrived there by boat fromVietnam. They were detained in detention centres, pending decisions as towhether to grant or refuse permission to remain in Hong Kong, or, if adecision to refuse permission were made, pending their removal from HongKong and repatriation to Vietnam. The applied for writs of habeas corpus totest the legality of their detention. By the time the appeal reached the PrivyCouncil, the applicants had been detained for long periods of time, the longest

from the Hong Kong courts.

being 24 months, pending determination of refugee status, followed by a
further 44 months. Citing Woolf J, as he then was, in R v Governor of Durham
Prison ex parte Singh (1984), the Privy Council endorsed the view, first, that the
power to detain could only be exercised during the period necessary, in all thecircumstances, to effect removal; secondly, that, if it becomes clear thatremoval is not going to be possible within a reasonable time, further detentionis not authorised; thirdly, that the person seeking to exercise the power ofdetention must take all reasonable steps to ensure removal within areasonable time. 
In Khawaja v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1984),discussed
above, the House of Lords had earlier considered the legality of a detentionorder pending removal, as an illegal immigrant, from the United Kingdom.
22
There was a dispute of fact as to whether the applicant had obtained leave toenter as a result of fraud. The House of Lords ruled that the issue of whetherthe applicant was an illegal immigrant was a matter which had to beestablished before it could be determined whether there was any power todetain with a view to deportation. That question ‘was a precedent orjurisdictional fact which, in the case of deprivation of liberty, had to be provedto exist before any power to detain was exercisable at all’.
In relation to Tan Te Lam and Others (1996) ,the question was analogous to
that in Khawaja. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated:
The issue therefore in the present case is whether the determination of the facts
relevant to the question whether the applicants were being detained ‘pendingremoval’ goes to the jurisdiction of the director to detain or to the exercise ofthe discretion to detain. In their Lordships’ view the facts are prima facie
jurisdictional. If removal is not pending, within the meaning of section 13D,the director has no power at all [to detain].
Further, as Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:
The case is analogous to one where a continuing discretion to detain isconferred on A if a notice has been served on B and no counternotice has beenserved by B. If there was a dispute as to whether a notice or counternotice hadbeen served, it must prima facie be for the court to determine the question: if no
notice has been served, A’s power has never arisen; if a counternotice has beenserved, A’s power has come to an end.
The detainees were ordered to be released.
Using powers for the wrong purpose
Powers conferred must be used for the purpose for which they were granted.
InAttorney General v Fulham Corporation (1921) ,the authority was empowered
under statute to establish washhouses for the non-commercial use of localresidents. The Corporation decided to open a laundry on a commercial basis.Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
88022 The power to detain in Khawaja arose from the Immigration Act 1971, Sched 2, paras 9
and 16.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
The Corporation was held to have acted ultra vires the statute. Westminster
Corporation v London and Northern Western Railway Company (1905) ,however,
represents a case where a charge of wrong purpose failed. The Corporation
had power, under section 44 of the Public Health Act 1891, to provide publicconveniences and had constructed them midway under the street with accessgained by means of a subway. The Railway Company which owned stock inadjacent buildings claimed that the power had been used improperly. TheHouse of Lords disagreed, stating that ‘the primary object of the council wasthe construction of the conveniences with the requisite and proper means ofapproach thereto and exit therefrom’.
Thus, where a public authority uses a power for the purpose intended by
parliament and reasonably provides a facility incidental to – orcomplementary to – the power conferred, the authority is acting within itspowers. It can of course be argued that the Corporation’s prime objective was,in fact, the provision of a subway; nevertheless, that objective – if it was theprimary objective – did not invalidate the action. 
The Westminster Corporation case was further considered in R v Inner
London Education Authority ex parte Westminster City Council (1986) ,which
provided an opportunity for the Divisional Court to consider the issue of twopurposes being pursued under one power. On the facts of the case, it was heldthat, in pursuing two purposes in relation to education funding, the Councilhad allowed an ‘irrelevant consideration’ to dominate its decision making andthat, accordingly, it had acted ultra vires. On the question of ‘two purposes’,
Lord Justice Glidewell cited both Professor Wade and Professor Evans.Professor Wade writes:
Sometimes, an act may serve two or more purposes, some authorised and
some not, and it may be a question whether the public authority may kill twobirds with one stone. The general rule is that its action will be lawful providedthe permitted purpose is the true and dominant purpose behind the act, eventhough some secondary or incidental advantage may be gained for somepurpose which is outside the authority’s powers. There is a clear distinctionbetween this situation and its opposite, where the permitted purpose is a merepretext and a dominant purpose is ultra vires. [Wade and Forsyth, 1994, p 388]
The test which Professor Evans prescribes is:
What is the true purpose for which the power was exercised? If the actor has intruth used his power for the purposes for which it was conferred, it isimmaterial that he was thus enabled to achieve a subsidiary object ...
Were any of the purposes pursuing an unauthorised purpose? If so, and if the
unauthorised purpose has materially influenced the actor’s conduct, the powerhas been invalidly exercised because irrelevant considerations have been takeninto account. [Cited in de Smith, 1980, pp 330–32]
Acting in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of an Act was seen inPadfield v Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968). Under the
Agricultural Marketing Act 1958, a Committee of Investigation wasestablished to make inquiries, if the minister ‘so directed’, into complaints
881

made to the minister concerning the operation of, amongst other products,
milk. South Eastern dairy farmers complained that the Milk Marketing Boardhad fixed prices in a manner prejudicial to farmers in the South Eastern regionof the country. The minister refused to refer the matter to the Committee ofInvestigation. The farmers challenged the minister’s decision. The House ofLords granted an order of mandamus, requiring the minister to considerproperly whether he should exercise his discretion to refer. The House ofLords ruled by a majority
23that, while the minister was not obliged to refer
every complaint made, neither did he have an unfettered discretion to refuseto refer a case. The result was something of a hollow victory for the farmers,since the incoming minister, having referred the matter to the committee,which upheld the complaint, rejected the committee’s recommendations.
24
In R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex parte World
Development Movement (1995), the government was held to have acted
unlawfully in relation to aid money paid to Malaysia. In 1988,25the United
Kingdom government signed an agreement with the Malaysian PrimeMinister, Mahathir Mohamed, for the sale of arms valued at £1.3 billion.
26In
1989, Britain offered £234 million towards the building of the Pergau Dam. In1991,
27the deal went ahead, despite warnings from officials that the project
was uneconomic and a waste of public funds. The monies were paid out of theOverseas Development Administration (ODA) budget. Under internationallaw, any linkage between aid monies and arms sales is prohibited. While thegovernment denied any such link, a House of Commons Foreign AffairsCommittee inquiry concluded that the government had, in effect, made such alink. Furthermore, under section 1 of the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980, the Foreign Secretary is empowered to authorisepayments only ‘for the purpose of promoting the development or maintainingthe economy of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom or thewelfare of its people’. The High Court ruled that the Foreign Secretary hadacted unlawfully, in part because the project was ‘economically unsound’, andalso because the aid did not promote the development of a country’s economyas required by law. As a result, some £55 million already spent on the projecthad to be returned to the ODA.

Relevant and irrelevant considerations in decision making

The Grounds for Judicial Review
883fine line between using powers for the wrong purpose and the relevancy of
considerations. Categorisation is a limited, although organisationally useful,device: the essential point to remember is that the heart of the matter lies inwhether or not discretionary powers have been exercised lawfully or not,irrespective of the headings under which cases may be grouped.
29One case
which straddles the boundaries of using powers for an improper purpose andtaking irrelevant considerations into account is that of R v Somerset County
Council ex parte Fewings (1995). The local authority decided to ban stag hunting
on land owned by the council and designated for recreational purposes.
30
Laws J accepted that, in some circumstances, stag hunting could legitimatelybe banned – for example, where the hunt would damage rare flora, or if theanimals themselves were rare. Here, however, the motivation behind the banwas the moral objection of the councillors to hunting. Laws J ruled that:
If the activity in question is permissible under the general law, as is the practice
of deer hunting, it is by no means to be prohibited on grounds only of thedecision maker’s distaste or ethical objection where the reach of his statutoryfunction on its face requires no more than the making of objective judgmentsfor the management of a particular regime. [p 530]
On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision was upheld, but on narrower
grounds. The Court ruled that the Council’s mind had not been directed torelevant statutory provisions, and it had not considered, as it was required todo, whether a ban of hunting would be for the general public benefit.
A case which illustrates the intermingling of grounds for review is that of
Wheeler v Leicester City Council (1985). In Wheeler , the House of Lords
thoroughly examined the concepts of unreasonableness and of fairness, andhere the interaction between bad faith, unreasonableness and proceduralimpropriety can be discerned. In 1984, the Rugby Football Union announced atour to South Africa, with a team including three members of the LeicesterFootball Club. At the time, the government was opposed to any sporting linkswith South Africa. Leicester City Council – with a 25 per cent immigrantpopulation – was virulently opposed to the proposed tour. The Leicester Clubsecretary attended a meeting with the leader of Leicester Council, at which hewas asked to support the government’s – and the council’s – policy ofopposition to the South African regime of apartheid. The club’s response wasto assert its opposition to apartheid but to stress that they were not constrainedfrom playing in South Africa as a result of governmental opposition, whichhad neither made such tours illegal nor subject to sanctions on those whovisited South Africa. As a result of the club’s refusal to comply with the CityCouncil’s request that they withdraw from the tour, Leicester City Councilresolved that the club would be suspended from using a local playing field fora 12 month period, the ban to be reviewed after a year and a new decision to be

taken based on the club’s attitude to South Africa at that time. The House of
Lords ruled that a political policy – however morally justified – could notprovide the lawful basis on which to deprive the club of engaging in its lawfulactivities.
As can be seen, the two purposes tests involves the issue of irrelevant
considerations. That is to say, a subsidiary or secondary purpose beingpursued may – if it dictates the decision making process – invalidate thatprocess. Here, attention is turned to situations where an authority fails to takeaccount of relevant considerations, or takes into account irrelevantconsiderations which materially affect the decision reached, and may be heldto be acting ultra vires. Many of the cases involve the fiduciary duty which is
owed by local authorities to their rate payers. In Roberts v Hopwood (1925), for
example, the local authority was empowered by statute to pay its workers ‘asit thought fit’.
31Nevertheless, when the council decided to pay wages which
were higher than the national average and to pay men and women equally, itwas held to have been acting beyond its powers. Its duty to its ratepayersoverrode its desire to better the lot of its workers.
32The court held that the
council was pursuing a policy of ‘philanthropic socialism’ which wasinconsistent with its duties to its ratepayers. Compare Roberts v Hopwood with
Pickwell v Camden London Borough Council (1983), in which the council had paid
additional monies to its manual workers in order to secure settlement of anindustrial dispute. It was held that the payments were reasonable. 
Similar considerations applied in Bromley London Borough Council v Greater
London Council (1983). There, the Greater London Council, wishing to increase
passenger numbers – and thereby reduce the traffic congestion on the roads –by decreasing fares on public transport, sought to pay for this by seeking ahigher level of subsidy for London Transport by increasing the rates payableby ratepayers, the burden of which would fall on the residents of Londonboroughs. The House of Lords held the Greater London Council to be actingultra vires. The House of Lords ruled that, whilst section 3 of the Transport
(London) Act 1969 conferred a wide discretion on the authority, and thatgrants could be levied to supplement the income from transport fares, thatdiscretion was limited by London Transport’s basic obligation to run itsoperations on ordinary business principles, which their fare reduction policycontravened. As in Roberts v Hopwood (1925), the council could not use its
grant making powers to achieve a social policy which was inconsistent withthose obligations: the Greater London Council (GLC) was using its powers forthe wrong purpose. Moreover, the rate reduction was also invalid in so far asit involved a breach of fiduciary duty owed by the council to its rate payers.The fact that the policy had been part of an election mandate was notsufficient justification for the policy. The members of the council wereChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Grounds for Judicial Review
representatives of the people, not delegates thereof. Accordingly, they were
not irrevocably bound to fulfil election promises but, rather, must act in theinterests of all constituents – not just those constituents who were users ofLondon Transport.
This view on the doctrine of mandate – or responsibility to electors – may
be contrasted with the decision in Secretary of State for Education v Tameside
Metropolitan Borough Council (1977), discussed above, pp 871–72. It will be
recalled that the Labour controlled Council in March 1975 proposed a schemeof comprehensive education to come into effect in 1976. In 1976, aConservative Council was elected. The Party had conducted its electioncampaign in large part on the education platform. On entering office, thecouncil reversed the education policy of the previous administration. TheSecretary of State issued a direction under section 68 of the Education Act1944, ordering the council to implement the comprehensive schooling policyof the previous local council. The House of Lords laid much emphasis on thewishes of the electorate. Lord Wilberforce declared that:
... if he [the Secretary of State] had exercised his judgment on the basis of the
factual situation in which this newly elected authority were placed – with apolicy approved by the electorate, and massively supported by the parents –there was no ground, however much he might disagree with the new policyand regret such administrative dislocation as was brought about by thechange, on which he could find that the authority were acting or proposing toact unreasonably ...
Where an irrelevant consideration does not affect the outcome of a decision,
the court may hold that the authority is acting intra vires. For example, in R v
Broadcasting Complaints Commission ex parte Owen (1985), the Broadcasting
Authority – with the statutory responsibility of ensuring fairness in theallocation of broadcasting time for political parties at election time – refused toconsider a complaint that a political party had been given too littlebroadcasting time. That decision was challenged in the courts. However,while the Commission had some good reasons for not considering thecomplaint, it had also erred by giving weight to an irrelevant consideration,namely, that the task would be burdensome. The court nevertheless held thatthe Commission was acting within its lawful discretion. 
Whether or not a local authority may not take into account considerations
relating to financial resources when assessing an individual’s needs wasconsidered by the Court of Appeal and House of Lords in R v Gloucestershire
County Council and Another ex parte Barry; R v Lancashire County Council ex parteRoyal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation and Another (1997).
33Under the
Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, a local authority is under theduty to identify the needs of disabled persons, and to meet such needs. TheCourt of Appeal held that neither a third party’s resources, nor the needs of
88533 See, also, R v Liverpool Crown Court ex parte Luxury Leisure Ltd (1998). 

others could be relevant to making the assessment of needs in relation to a
disabled person. If that were to be the correct interpretation of the statute, alocal authority with no funds to meet needs could avoid its duty to assess theneeds and make the necessary provision. That would fly in the face of theplain language of the 1970 Act. In the House of Lords, however, that decisionwas reversed. By a majority of three to two, the House of Lords ruled that theresources of the authority were a relevant consideration. Lord Nicholls ofBirkenhead conceded that the argument put forward by Lord Lloyd,dissenting, that a person’s needs were unaffected by local authority resourceswas an ‘alluring argument’, but one which he could not accept. The argument,he stated, was flawed by a ‘failure to recognise that needs for services cannotsensibly be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providingthem’.
The reasoning of the majority in the House of Lords in Barry, was followed
inR v Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council ex parte Help the Aged and Others
(1997). In that case, the needs of an elderly woman who was admitted to anursing home, and the cost of meeting those needs, were in issue. Havingconsidered the case of Barry, the Court of Appeal ruled that a local authority
was entitled to have regard to its own limited financial resources. However,where a need existed, the authority was under a statutory duty to makearrangements to meet that need and lack of resources was no excuse. Theauthority could not, from the time that a person was assessed as being inneed, fail to meet their statutory duty. Financial considerations wereuppermost in the decision in R v Cambridge Health Authority ex parte B (1995),
34
in which the Court of Appeal held that the courts could not make judgmentsabout how health authorities decide to allocate a limited budget. The healthauthority had refused to fund further chemotherapy or a second bone marrowtransplant for a ten year old girl with only a few weeks to live.Notwithstanding that decisions relating to human life had to treated with thegreatest seriousness, the court could not substitute its judgment about theallocation of financial resources for that of the authority.
In R v East Sussex County Council ex parte Tandy (1998), the House of Lords
ruled that, although a local education authority could have regard to itsresources when deciding which of two alternative ways of providing suitableeducation should be chosen, resources were irrelevant when determiningwhat sort of education was suitable under the Education Act 1993, section 298of which defines suitable education as ‘efficient education suitable to his age,ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may have’. Theeffect of taking resources into account would be to downgrade a statutoryduty to a mere power. 
In B v Harrow London Borough Council (2000), the House of Lords ruled
that, when considering the impact of the cost of meeting special educationalChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Grounds for Judicial Review
887needs to the pupil’s own local authority and another authority to which the
parents had expressed a preference, it was to the home authority’s resourcesthat attention must be paid.
The question of a local authority’s financial resources came before the
Court of Appeal again in R v Camden and Islington Health Authority ex parte E
(2001). The applicant had been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983,and a tribunal ordered her conditional discharge. The health authority tried,but could not provide, the specified psychiatric care. The 1983 Act imposed aduty on health authorities to provide after-care facilities for the benefit ofdischarged mental patients. The ‘nature and extent’ of those facilities had tofall within the discretion of the health authority, having regard to otherdemands on its budget. The court considered the right to liberty guaranteedunder Article 5 of the Convention. Whether it was necessary to detain apatient in hospital might well depend on the level of facilities available fortreatment within the community; Article 5 did not lay down any criteria overthe state’s duties to provide facilities, nor had the European Court. If releasewas conditional on the provision of treatment which a health authority couldnot reasonably meet, the continued detention of the patient did not violateArticle 5.
Acting in bad faith
In Cannock Chase District Council v Kelly (1978), Megaw LJ cited Lord Greene in
Wednesbury : ‘... bad faith, dishonesty – those of course stand by themselves.’
Megaw LJ went on to say that: 
... bad faith or, as it is sometimes put, ‘lack of good faith’, means dishonesty;
not necessarily for a financial motive, but still dishonesty. It always involves agrave charge. It must not be treated as a synonym for an honest, thoughmistaken, taking into consideration of a factor which is in law irrelevant ... [p 6]
To some extent, any decision which is ultra vires may involve ‘bad faith’
whenever there has been a failure to decide a case in the manner required by
law. Some decisions however, may have inadvertently breached therequirements of legality, whereas others will reveal an improper motive andunreasonableness, and more clearly demonstrate that the decision makeracted in ‘bad faith’. 
Fettering discretion
An authority may act ultra vires if, in the exercise of its powers, it adopts a
policy which effectively means that it is not truly exercising its discretion atall. This principle is explained in R v Port of London Authority ex parte Kynoch
(1919),
35in which it was held that an authority could not adopt a rigid policy
35 See Galligan, 1976.

which had the effect of ensuring that applications of a certain category would
invariably be refused. In Kynoch, the applicant sought judicial review of the
decision of the Port of London Authority to refuse him permission toconstruct a wharf on land he owned adjoining the Thames river. Permissionwas refused on the basis that the Authority itself had a duty to provide thefacilities. The challenge to the Authority’s decision failed, on the basis that itappeared to the court that the Authority had given genuine consideration tothe application on its merits. 
Compare Kynoch with British Oxygen Co v Board of Trade (1971) in which
Kynoch was judicially considered. In BOC, the House of Lords upheld the right
of the Board of Trade to have a general policy, provided that the policy didnot preclude the Board from considering individual cases. Lord Reidconsidered the scope of discretion, asserting that:
There are two general grounds on which the exercise of an unqualified
discretion can be attacked. It must not be exercised in bad faith, and it must notbe so unreasonably exercised as to show that there cannot have been any realor genuine exercise of the discretion. But, apart from that, if the minister thinksthat policy or good administration requires the operation of some limiting rule,I find nothing to stop him ...
What the authority must not do is to refuse to listen at all.
The application failed. The Board of Trade had not adopted a rigid and
invariable policy which rendered the consideration of applications a meresham exercise in which there was no possibility of a fair consideration of themerits because of the adoption of a rigid policy.
However, in H Lavender & Sons Ltd v Minister of Housing and Local
Government (1970), a different conclusion was reached. Lavender had applied
for planning permission to extract sand and gravel from high gradeagricultural land. The local planning authority refused permission andLavender appealed to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. Theappeal was dismissed, the Minister of Housing and Local Government beingpersuaded by the Minister of Agriculture that such land should be preservedfor agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the minister ruled that:
It is the minister’s present policy that land should not be released for mineral
working unless the Minister of Agriculture is not opposed. In the present case,the agricultural objection has not been waived and the minister has thereforedecided not to grant planning permission for the working of the site. 
The decision was set aside. The minister was entitled to have a policy but, in
reality, in this instance, the minister’s decision had been based solely onanother minister’s objection. The minister, therefore, did not open his mind toLavender’s application and thereby fettered his discretion. In reality, thedecision to refuse planning permission was that of the Minister of Agriculturewho had no power to determine such matters.
In Stringer v Minister of Housing and Local Government (1970), the court
considered the legality of a minister’s policy to restrict development of landwhich could interfere with the Jodrell Bank telescope. The court held that theChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
888

The Grounds for Judicial Review
minister’s general policy was lawful, provided that the policy did not result in
his failing to take into account relevant issues in each individual applicationfor planning permission. 
Sagnata Investments v Norwich Corporation (1971) illustrates the same point.
The Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1963 provided that the grant orrenewal of a permit to run amusement arcades was to be ‘at the discretion ofthe local authority’. Sagnata Investments applied for a licence which wasturned down on the basis that the council had a policy never to grant permitsfor arcades in Norwich. There was no objection to Sagnata Investments itself;rather, no application – whatever its merits – would have succeeded becauseof the council’s policy. The court held that the council had failed to exercise itsdiscretion under the Act and had paid no regard whatsoever to the merits ofthe application. The council’s decision was therefore quashed.
36
In R v Chief Constable of North Wales Police and Others ex parte AB and
Another (1997),37the Queen’s Bench Division ruled that the policy of the
North Wales police to disclose information to members of the publicconcerning the presence of a former paedophile offender was not unlawful.The court recognised that, in general, good public administration involved notdisclosing damaging information about individuals unless there was soundjustification for so doing. The applicants for judicial review, who weremarried, had both been convicted of serious sexual offences against children,and had served long prison sentences. The Lord Chief Justice recognised thetension between the rights of former offenders and the interests of thecommunity. The police had not adopted a policy of blanket disclosure, buthad carefully considered the case on its merits, and accordingly had notfettered its discretion. The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
38The
Master of the Rolls, Lord Woolf, recognised that, in such cases, there was abalance to be struck between providing protection for children who might beat risk, and the position of the offender who had already served his sentenceand wished to re-establish himself in the community. There was also a need toavoid driving offenders ‘underground’. The position of the police was‘difficult and sensitive’. Disclosure should only be made when there was a‘pressing need for such disclosure’. The action of the police had been neitherirrational, nor was the policy unlawful. 
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Dinc (1998), the
applicant had been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and the judge hadrecommended that he be deported at the end of his term of imprisonment. In
88936 See, also, Stringer v Minister of Housing and Local Government (1970) on fettering
discretion.
37 See Barber, 1998. See also R (H) v Ashworth Hospital Authority; R (Ashworth Health
Authority) v Mental Health Review Tribunal for West Midlands and North West Region
(2002).

Another (1998), and see the government’s proposals for arrangements on release of
paedophiles from prison, HL Deb, Vol 589, Col 479, 5 May 1998.

1995, the Secretary of State accepted the recommendation and made the
deportation order. The applicant sought judicial review of that decision. Thecourt ruled that the Secretary of State had fettered his discretion by relying onthe judge’s view and had given disproportionate weight to it. This had ledhim to leave out of account relevant factors.
39In R v North West Lancashire
Health Authority ex parte A (1999), the Court of Appeal ruled that a health
authority had adopted a policy which was invalid, by allocating low priorityfor the public funding of procedures which it considered to be clinicallyineffective, which included gender re-assignment surgery. The Court ofAppeal stated that the policy was over-rigid and did not amount to a genuinepolicy subject to individually determined exceptions.
The House of Lords’ decision in R v Secretary of State for the Home
Department ex parte Simms (1999) is also significant in demonstrating the
courts’ refusal to allow a strict policy to undermine individual rights. Thedecision in Simms was reached on common law principles and before the
Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, but nevertheless the approach takenis consistent with post-Human Rights Act cases. It may be compared with theHouse of Lords’ decision in Daly, discussed below, in which a prison policy
was held to violate a Convention right.
40In Simms, the applicants had been
convicted of murder but continued to plead their innocence; they had beenrefused permission to appeal against their convictions. The prisoners wishedto pursue their claim to justice through the press. The Home Secretary hadadopted a policy which imposed a blanket ban on journalists interviewingprisoners with a view to publication, on the basis that such publicity couldundermine prison control and discipline. The House of Lords overruled theCourt of Appeal’s decision upholding the ban. Lord Steyn concluded – in thelanguage of proportionality and human rights
41– that ‘these provisions are
exorbitant in width in so far as they would undermine the fundamental rightsinvoked by the applicants in the present proceedings and are therefore ultra
vires’.
The decision of the House of Lords in R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department (2001)
42is also important in demonstrating the movement
away from the traditional test of Wednesbury unreasonableness towards the
doctrines of necessity and proportionality. The House of Lords ruled that thepolicy of excluding prisoners from their cells while prison officers conductedsearches – which included scrutinising privileged legal correspondence – wasunlawful. Lord Bingham stated that the conclusion had been reachedaccording to common law principles, but accepted that the same result couldChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
89039 On judicial review of immigration and asylum decisions, see Chapter 22.
40 In Daly, the right in question was the right to privacy. In Simms – had it been heard after
the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, the issue would have been freedom of
expression under Article 10.
41 On which see below.
42 Discussed further at p 653.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
have been achieved if the analysis had proceeded on the basis of the European
Convention.43Lord Cooke was explicit in recognising the limitations of the
traditional Wednesbury approach, stating that before long it would be accepted
that the Wednesbury case was an unfortunately retrogressive decision in
English law. 
The dicta in Simms and Daly both illustrate the willingness of the judges in
the House of Lords to develop and expand common law doctrines in amanner which brings them into line with the European concepts of necessityand proportionality. It may be said that the conventional Wednesbury test is
dead, or nearly so – superseded by proportionality, as discussed furtherbelow. That this is a more vigorous form of scrutiny was recognised by LordSteyn in Daly. This, however, does not mean that the courts are moving away
from the review of the decision making process and towards a review on the
merits of decisions: rather it suggests that the ‘more sophisticated’ approach
will lead to the ‘intensity of review’ being ‘somewhat greater’ ( perLord Steyn
in Daly ).
Unauthorised delegation
Where powers are conferred by statute, the general rule is that they may notbe delegated unless that delegation is authorised by law. Not all delegationswill be unlawful. The courts will not hold, for instance, that a minister mustexercise each and every power personally. It is accepted that that, wherestatute confers powers on ministers, the powers are, in fact, exercisable on hisbehalf by the personnel of his department. As explained in Local Government
Board v Arlidge (1915), ‘a minister cannot do everything himself’.
44In Arlidge –
an early and seminal case which ensured the conduct of government underthe supervision of the courts – the court held that, whilst a minister couldlawfully delegate his power of determination to a subordinate, he,nevertheless, remained constitutionally and personally accountable toparliament for the conduct of his department.
45
This principle was well illustrated in Carltona v Works Commissioners
(1943). The Commissioners were given powers, under wartime regulations, torequisition property. Carltona’s property was requisitioned, the order forrequisition being signed, for and on behalf of the Commissioners, by a civilservant with the rank of assistant secretary. Lord Greene MR stated that:
It cannot be supposed that the particular statutory provision meant that in
every case the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter.Constitutionally the decision of such an officer is the decision of the minister;
89143 The relevant Convention right being the right to privacy under Article 8.
44 Note, also, that this case is also an early authority for the proposition that the rules of
natural justice do not necessarily require an oral hearing in every case: perTaylor LJ in R
v Army Board of the Defence Council ex parte Anderson (1991).
45 See Dicey (1898), 1959, Appendix 2.

the minister is responsible to Parliament. If the minister delegated to a junior
official then he would have to answer to Parliament ... 
The decision in Arlidge may be compared with that of Barnard v National Dock
Labour Board (1953). In Barnard, disciplinary powers delegated by statute to the
London Dock Board were subdelegated to a port manager. That delegation
was held to be ultra vires, on the basis that such a disciplinary function could
not lawfully be delegated to another and must be exercised by the Board towhom the power was granted. Similarly, in R v Talbot Borough Council ex parte
Jones (1988), where a local councillor applied for local authority housing. The
housing tenancy committee resolved that the applicant should be givenpriority status and that her rehousing, subsequent to divorce, should bedecided by the chairman and vice chairman of the committee, according to theCouncil’s Standing Orders,
46in consultation with the Borough Housing
Officer. In 1986, the Housing Officer allocated her a house. In proceedings forjudicial review, it was held that the decision to allocate housing could notlawfully be subdelegated from the chairman and vice chairman of thecommittee to the Housing Officer. The decision was also void on the groundsthat irrelevant considerations had been taken into account and that relevantconsiderations – the needs of others on the waiting list – had been ignored.
In Oladehinde v Secretary of State for the Home Department (1990) ,the
question of authorised delegation came before the House of Lords. Theapplicants wished to challenge notices of intention to deport them. The noticeswere issued by immigration inspectors. The applicants argued that the powersunder the Immigration Act 1971 were conferred upon the Secretary of Stateand could not be delegated. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal. TheAct provided specific matters which could not be delegated by the minister,and the court would not infer further restrictions. Provided that the decisionwas taken by officials of suitable grading and experience, they wereunchallengeable .
Failure to act
An authority may be under a statutory duty to take action and, dependingupon the specificity of that duty, may be held to be acting unlawfully if it failsto act. This is a difficult area of law, in that some duties imposed by statute areclear and precise, and hence enforceable by the courts, whereas others may beof a general, non-specific nature and thus not court-enforceable: all will turnon the wording of the statute. Statute may stipulate the objective to beachieved but leave it to a local authority or other public body to determine themanner in which the objective should be achieved. Furthermore, in manycases, statute will provide that the Secretary of State shall have defaultpowers, by the use of which he can compel a local authority to act should itChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
89246 Under the Local Government Act 1972, s 101.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
fail so to do, in which case, the courts may be reluctant to permit the pursuit of
an alternative remedy.47InR v Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte
Norwich (1982), the authority had the duty to sell council housing to tenants48
at a discounted rate. If a tenant exercised his or her right to buy, and thecouncil did not respect that right, the minister could exercise his powers toensure compliance with the legislation, if satisfied that a tenant’s right had‘not effectively and expeditiously’ been recognised. The council argued thatthis policy was reasonable. However, the Court of Appeal rejected thatargument, since the council had no discretion in light of the statutory right tobuy. The failure of the council to implement the ‘right to buy’ legislation wasto be controlled by the minister. Should the minister, in the exercise of hispowers, act ultra vires, the court will control the exercise of power by judicial
review. However, the courts may not be willing to rule against the ministermerely because the court takes a different view of the merits of the case ( per
Lord Denning).
An example of powers which are inextricably linked to resource
availability can be seen in relation to health care provision. The Secretary ofState for Health is under an obligation to provide hospital beds for those inneed. If, in contravention of this clear requirement, a patient is denied ahospital bed, an action for judicial review will lie but, if the minister claimsinadequate resources, the judges may be reluctant to hold a minister to be inbreach of his duties. A more appropriate avenue of redress for a complainantmay be to the Health Service Commissioners.
49
Judicial review of Home Secretary’s powers in relation to penal
elements in mandatory life sentences
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Pierson (1995),the
Court of Appeal ruled on the legality of the Home Secretary’s decision to fix
the penal element of a mandatory life sentence at twenty years, havingrejected the recommendation of the judges that the term should be fifteenyears. An incoming Home Secretary adhered to his predecessor’s decision.The Home Secretary had the power, under section 35 of the Criminal JusticeAct 1991, to release on licence a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentencewhich he could exercise after consulting the trial judge and the Lord ChiefJustice and if release was recommended by the Parole Board. On anapplication for judicial review, the Court held that the decision was notirrational and that there was nothing in law to stop the Secretary of Stateexceptionally revising upwards the period originally determined, on the

ground that it did not adequately meet the requirement of retribution and
deterrence. On appeal to the House of Lords, however, the decision of theCourt of Appeal was reversed. By a majority of three to two, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd of Berwick dissenting, the House of Lords ruledthat the Home Secretary had not been entitled to set the appellant’s tariffperiod at 20 years when it had been shown that his predecessor in office hadproceeded on the wrong basis by taking into account aggravatingcircumstances, in particular premeditation, when originally fixing the tariff. Indoing so, the former Home Secretary had exceeded his powers for, by takinginto account aggravating circumstances, the Home Secretary had not left thetariff period unchanged but had, in effect, increased the penal element in thesentence. Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead asserted that, once the tariffis set and communicated to the prisoner, the tariff cannot be raised. 
Lord Goff asserted that the Home Secretary had exceeded his powers
because the policy statement relied on by the Home Secretary could not haveretrospective effect and, therefore, could not apply to the appellant’s casewhere the tariff period for retribution and deterrence had already been fixedand under the earlier policy statement was not liable to be increased. Giventhe differing bases for the decision, and the narrow majority in the House ofLords, there is no firm proposition as to the Home Secretary’s right to increasethe tariff. The current Home Secretary, Jack Straw, has restated that in hisview he still has this power.
The Home Secretary’s power to set a tariff period of imprisonment again
came under scrutiny in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte
Venables; R v Same ex parte Thompson (1996).
50In this case, two child killers of a
child aged two and a half applied for judicial review of the Home Secretary’sdecision to fix a tariff period of 15 years for each child, on the basis that thisreflected the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The two boys hadbeen detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure following their conviction. 
The House of Lords ruled, by a majority of three to two, that there was a
distinction between a sentence of detention at Her Majesty’s pleasure and alife sentence imposed on an adult murderer. The order for detentionconcerned the authority to detain indefinitely and, accordingly, the HomeSecretary had to decide from time to time, taking into account the punitiveelement, whether detention was still justified. A mandatory life sentence, onthe other hand, involved an order of custody for life which meant that theHome Secretary had to decide whether and when release was justified.Furthermore, the Home Secretary was under a duty
51to take into account the
welfare of the child when exercising his discretion in relation to childoffenders. It was, accordingly, unlawful for the Home Secretary to adopt aChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
89450 But see V and T v United Kingdom , wherein the Court of Human Rights found
Convention violations, discussed in Chapter 19.
51 Imposed under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, s 44(1).

The Grounds for Judicial Review
policy which treated as irrelevant the progress and development of the
detained child. Secondly, the court ruled by a majority of three, that, in fixinga tariff, the Home Secretary was under the same duty as a judge, and wasrequired to remain detached from public opinion. The Home Secretary hadaccordingly misdirected himself and his decision was tainted with proceduralunfairness as a result.
52
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Hindley (2000),
however, the right of the Home Secretary to determine the length of the penalelement of a prison sentence to be served by a person convicted of murderwas upheld by the House of Lords. As noted above, the Home Secretary’spowers derive from the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which makes it clear thatthe Home Secretary has discretion as to the length of the penal element. Thequestion which arose was whether the Home Secretary had the right to set awhole life tariff, which had the effect that Hindley’s case could not beconsidered by the Parole Board. Hindley had been convicted in 1965. In 1982,the then Lord Chief Justice stated that a term of not less than 25 years wasappropriate. In 1985, the Home Secretary reached the decision that theapplicant should serve 30 years. In 1990, the Home Secretary decided that theapplicant’s sentence should be for her whole life, a decision upheld in 1997 bythe new Home Secretary. The House of Lords ruled that there was no reasonof principle which stated that crimes which were ‘sufficiently heinous’ shouldnot be met with a whole life tariff. The Home Secretary was prepared toconstantly re-assess the decision in light of further information and it couldnot be said that he had unlawfully fettered his discretion.
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Stafford (1997), the
Court of Appeal ruled that section 29 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997conferred an ‘extraordinary, wide discretion’ on the Home Secretary. Thatdiscretion permitted the Home Secretary to refuse to release a mandatory lifesentence prisoner, after the expiry of the term of imprisonment imposed, onthe basis that the prisoner, once released, might commit some imprisonableoffence, or not comply with the terms of his life sentence, even though the riskof him committing serious sexual offences for which he had been sentencedwas thought to be low. The court declared that the imposition, in effect, of afurther substantial term of imprisonment, by the exercise of executivediscretion, without trial, ‘lay uneasily with ordinary concepts of the rule oflaw’. On appeal to the House of Lords, the Court of Appeal’s decision wasaffirmed.
The power of the executive to determine the length of a sentence which
should be served in order to satisfy the needs of ‘retribution and deterrence’ inlight of the seriousness of a crime has been a long standing feature within thelegal system. It is one, however, which has come increasingly under review bythe courts in judicial review proceedings and by the Court of Human Rights
89552 See, also, R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Furber (1997).

in Strasbourg. The power to determine the length of a sentence is one which
confuses the executive and judicial role. From the executive’s point of view, itis a power which is exercised on behalf of society – and in relation to which heor she is answerable to the democratically elected House of Commons – togive recognition to the needs of justice where particularly serious crimes havebeen committed. The most high profile case is that of Myra Hindley, discussedabove, who by 2002 had served 37 years in prison and had repeatedly beenrefused release.
53From the point of view of the separation of powers, the
executive’s power is incompatible with the need to keep judicial and executivefunctions separate.
PROCEDURAL IMPROPRIETY
Under statute
Failure to comply with procedures laid down by statute may invalidate adecision. The courts distinguish between those procedural requirementswhich are mandatory, the breach of which will render a decision void, andthose which are directory, which may not invalidate the decision taken. InLondon and Clydesdale Estates Ltd v Aberdeen District Council (1979), the House
of Lords emphasised the inherent vagueness in the distinction and stressedthat the court would not draw a hard and fast line: it is all a matter of degreeand the particular circumstances of the case must be examined. However, insome cases, the requirement to adhere to procedural correctness is clear. Forexample, in Bradbury v Enfield London Borough Council (1967) ,the Education
Act 1944 provided that, if a local education authority intends to establish newschools or cease to maintain existing schools, notice must be given to theminister, following which, public notice must be given in order to allowinterested parties to comment.
54The Council breached the requirement of
public notice and the plaintiffs sought an injunction. The Council claimed thateducational chaos would occur if they were required to comply with theprocedural requirements. That plea met with little sympathy in court. LordDenning stated that:
... if a local authority does not fulfil the requirements of the law, this court will
see that it does fulfil them. It will not listen readily to suggestions of ‘chaos’.The department of education and the council are subject to the rule of law andmust comply with it, just like everyone else ... I can well see that there may be aconsiderable upset for a number of people, but I think it far more important touphold the rule of law. Parliament has laid down these requirements so as toensure that the electors can make their objections and have them properlyconsidered. We must see that their rights are upheld. [p 1324]Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
89653 In total, there are 22 convicted killers who are expected to die in prison unless there is a
change in the law.
54 Education Act 1944, s 13.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
Further, as has been seen earlier, in the Aylesbury Mushroom case,55the court
ruled that the statutory requirements of consultation56with organisations or
associations which represented substantial numbers of people could not be
avoided by consultation with the largest representative body of allagricultural horticultural and forestry industry, workers – the NationalFarmers’ Union. The Board claimed that consultation with the NationalFarmers’ Union involved consultation with all smaller representative bodies; aclaim rejected by the court. For true consultation to take place in accordancewith law, there must be communication with the representative organisationsand the opportunity given of responding thereto, without which ‘there can beno consultation’. 
However, on occasion, although an authority is under a duty to act, and
fails to act, the court may nevertheless uphold the decision made, providedthat the decision making process was otherwise fair and the failure to act doesnot affect the quality of the decision reached. This was the position in Berkeley
v Secretary of State for the Environment and Another (1998). In this case, in a
planning application by Fulham Football Club to redevelop part of its land toprovide apartments and a riverside walk, the Secretary of State wasrequired
57to consider the environmental impact of the proposed
development, and to issue an ‘environmental statement’. Notwithstanding thefailure of the Secretary of State to comply with the regulations, planningpermission was granted. On appeal to the Court of Appeal against the refusalof the court below to quash the planning permission, the Court of Appealruled that the Secretary of State’s failure to act did not invalidate the decision.The planning application had been referred to the Secretary of State who hadappointed an inspector. A public hearing had been held, at which theapplicant had been heard and at which the environmental impact of theproposed development had been fully considered. The court found that ‘theprocedures adopted, although flawed, had been thorough and effective [so as]to enable the inspector to make a comprehensive judgment on all theenvironmental issues’. 
The Court of Appeal re-examined the effect of non-compliance with
procedural requirements laid down in statute in R v Secretary of State for the
Home Department ex parte Jeyeanthan ; Ravichandran v Secretary of State for the
Home Department (1999). The Home Secretary had failed to comply
substantially with the requirements of the Asylum Appeals Rules by notincluding a declaration of truth in an application for leave to appeal from aspecial adjudicator to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. However, the asylum

seeker had not been affected by the omission, which was treated as an
irregularity capable of being cured by the Tribunal. The court ruled that, indetermining the effect of non-compliance with a procedural requirement, thecourt should consider what the legislator had intended to be the consequencesof non-compliance, rather than merely whether the requirement wasmandatory or directory. Neither of the applicants had in any way beenaffected by the omission and, other than to discipline the Secretary of State,there could be no reason to treat his successful application for leave as anullity.
Breach of natural justice
Of course, there is a wealth of authority on what are and what are not the rules
of natural justice. The rules have been described in various ways, as an ‘unrulyhorse’, I think, in one decision, and there is no doubt that what may be therules of natural justice in one case may well not be the rules of natural justice inanother. As has frequently been said, and there is no harm in repeating it, allthat the rules of natural justice mean is that the proceedings must be conductedin a way which is fair ... fair in all the circumstances.
58
That the rules of natural justice are not rigid and determinate is emphasised
by Lord Bridge in Lloyd v McMahon (1987):
... the so called rules of natural justice are not engraved on tablets of stone. To
use the phrase which better expresses the underlying concept, what therequirements of fairness demand when any body, domestic, administrative orjudicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of individualsdepends on the character of the decision making body, the kind of question ithas to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates.
The rules of natural justice are common law rules – although, in many
instances, their requirements may be made statutory. The fundamental dictateof justice is that those affected by decision makers should be dealt with in afair manner. In order for this to be achieved, there may be severalrequirements which must be fulfilled. 
The rule against bias: nemo iudex in causa sua59
The essence of justice lies in a fair hearing. The rule against bias is strict: it isnot necessary to show that actual bias existed, the merest appearance orpossibility of bias will suffice: ‘... justice should not only be done but shouldmanifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.’
60The suspicion of bias must,
however, be a reasonable one. Both financial or personal interest in a case maydisqualify a person from adjudicating. Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
89858 Lord Lane CJ in R v Commission for Racial Equality ex parte Cottrell and Rothon (1980),
p 1586.
59 See Rawlings, 1980. On the independence of the judiciary see, also, Chapter 5.
60 See R v Sussex Justices ex parte McCarthy (1924), p 259, discussed below.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
Financial bias
In Dr Bonham’s Case (1609) ,Lord Coke held that members of a board which
determined the level of physicians’ fines could not both impose and receive
the fines, thus giving early judicial expression for the requirement of freedomfrom bias. An early expression of the absolute requirement not only to beimpartial in fact, but also to be demonstrably and clearly free from the merestsuspicion of bias is found in Dimes v Grand Junction Canal Ltd (1852). In Dimes ,
Lord Cottenham LC held shares in the canal company involved in litigation.The House of Lords set aside the decision in which he had adjudicated despitethe fact that:
No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be in the remotest degree
influenced by the interest ... It is of the last importance that the maxim that noman is to be judge in his own cause should be held sacred.
Thus, the mere existence of a financial interest, even where it does not, in fact,
result in actual bias but may present the appearance of bias will be sufficientto disqualify a judge from adjudication.
In R v Sussex Justices ex parte McCarthy (1924), the applicant had been
charged with dangerous driving and convicted. On discovering that the clerkto the magistrates’ court was a solicitor who had represented the person suingMcCarthy for damages, McCarthy applied for judicial review based on bias onthe part of the clerk. The clerk had retired with the magistrates when theywere considering their verdict. It was accepted that the magistrates neithersought advice nor were given advice by the clerk during their retirement.Nevertheless, McCarthy’s conviction was invalidated on the basis of thepossibility of bias. 
The question of financial bias again arose in Metropolitan Properties Co v
Lannon (1969), where an application was lodged by a property company in
order to challenge a decision of a rent assessment committee on the basis thatLannon, a member of the committee had, in his professional capacity as asolicitor, given advice to tenants of a close business associate of the propertycompany. Lord Denning MR ruled that, while there was no actual bias:
... the court looks at the impression which would be given to other people.
Even if he was as impartial as could be, nevertheless, if right minded personswould think that, in the circumstances, there was a real likelihood of bias onhis part, then he should not sit. And, if he does sit, his decision cannot stand ...
The court will not inquire whether he did, in fact, favour one side unfairly.
Suffice it that reasonable people might think he did. The reason is plainenough. Justice must be rooted in confidence: and confidence is destroyedwhen right minded people go away thinking: ‘The judge was biased.’ [p 599]
A financial interest in a case which does not go beyond the financial interest of
any citizen does not disqualify judges from sitting. Thus, for example, in
899

Bromley London Borough Council v Greater London Council (1983), the fact that all
the judges in the Court of Appeal were themselves both taxpayers and users
of public transport in London did not disqualify them from hearing the case. 
The same position prevails in the United States of America61but, there, the
issue of the financial interests of federal judges is expressly covered by statute.The Ethics in Government Act 1978 requires that Supreme Court and Federaljudges must make a public declaration of ‘income, gifts, shares, liabilities andtransactions in securities and real estate’.
62
Other bias
Judges – as with any other person – may exhibit bias by virtue of race, sex,politics, background, association and opinions.
63When adjudicating,
however, they must be demonstrably impartial. This impartiality involves:
... the judge, listening to each side with equal attention, and coming to a
decision on the argument, irrespective of his personal view about the litigants...
and, further, a requirement that:
Whatever his personal beliefs, the judge should seek to give effect to thecommon values of the community, rather than any sectional system of valuesto which he may adhere.
64
The seminal case on bias is the Pinochet case.65In Pinochet, extradition
proceedings against the former Chilean Head of State were challenged on the
basis that one of the Law Lords, Lord Hoffmann, had links with AmnestyInternational, the charitable pressure group which works on behalf of politicalprisoners around the world, which had been allowed to present evidence tothe court. It was accepted that there was no actual bias on the part of LordHoffmann, but there were concerns that the public perception might be that asenior judge was biased. As a result, the proceedings were abandoned and re-heard by a new bench of seven judges.
The Court of Appeal reconsidered judicial bias in the Locabail (UK) Ltd v
Bayfield Properties Ltd (2000) cases. The court distinguished the two rules
relating to disqualification, the first being where the judge had an interest in acase which he decided, as in Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852), and where he
would be automatically disqualified. The second rule was that based onexamination of all the relevant circumstances, where there was a real dangeror possibility of bias, as in R v Gough (1993). In relation to the circumstances
surrounding Timmins v Gormley , one of the Locabail cases, which concerned theChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Grounds for Judicial Review
publication, by the Recorder who adjudicated in a personal injury case, of
articles which were allegedly biased in favour of claimants and againstinsurers, the court ruled that, taking a broad common sense approach, a layobserver with knowledge of the facts could not have excluded the possibilitythat the Recorder was biased. While it was not inappropriate for a judge topublish in his area of expertise, and that such contributions could furtherrather than hinder the administration of justice, nevertheless, it was alwaysinappropriate for a judge to use intemperate language about subjects onwhich he had adjudicated or would have to adjudicate. The appeal wasallowed and a retrial ordered.
66
Uncertainty in the test for bias
There has been uncertainty and inconsistency in the interpretation of ‘bias’. InR v Gough (1993), opposing counsel presented two different tests for bias. The
first suggested criterion was whether a reasonable and fair minded personsitting in the court and knowing all the relevant facts would have had areasonable suspicion that a fair trial of the defendant was not possible – the‘reasonable suspicion’ test. The second suggested test was whether there wasa real likelihood of bias. The question to be asked is whether there was a ‘realdanger’ that a trial may not have been fair as a result of bias – the ‘reallikelihood’ test.
67The House of Lords declared that the correct test was
whether there was a real likelihood, in the sense of a real possibility, of bias ofthe part of a justice or member of a tribunal. 
Where a judge feels that he has a bias against one of the parties to litigation
he may disqualify himself from sitting on the case, as did Lord Denning MRin Ex parte Church of Scientology of California (1978). There, counsel for the
Church requested that he disqualify himself as a result of eight previous casesinvolving the Church on which he had sat. 
The right to a fair hearing:68audi alteram partem
It is a fundamental requirement of justice that, when a person’s interests areaffected by a judicial or administrative decision, he or she has the opportunityboth to know and to understand any allegations made, and to makerepresentations to the decision maker to meet the allegations. By way ofexample, a fair determination of a case may involve one or more of thefollowing:
(a) the right to being given notification of a hearing; 
(b) the right to be given indications of any adverse evidence;(c) the right to be given an opportunity to respond to the evidence;
90166 See, also, R v Local Commissioner for Administration in North and North East England ex
parte Liverpool City Council (2000), discussed in Chapter 26.
67 At p 727; see, also, R v Spencer (1987).
68 See Rawlings, 1986.

(d) the right to an oral hearing;
(e) the right to legal representation at a hearing;(f) the right to question witnesses.
The basic requirement is that – irrespective of the decision making body,
whether ‘judicial’, ‘quasi-judicial’ or ‘administrative’ – the individual shouldbe treated fairly in the decision making process.
‘Judicial’, ‘quasi-judicial’ and ‘administrative’ functions: the distinctions
The courts have long been struggling with the distinction between ‘judicial’,‘quasi-judicial’ and ‘administrative’ functions in an attempt to bring the ever-expanding administration of government departments under judicial control.Two lines of thought were apparent. The first emphasised the distinctionbetween a body which was exercising powers under restrictive rules and abody which was conferred with a wide measure of administrativediscretionary power.
69The second line of thought placed great weight on the
absence of any true distinction between judicial and administrative functions,regarding the former as but a specialised form of the latter.
70As a result of
conceptual confusion, the phrase ‘quasi-judicial’ came to be used to coverthose functions which were not easily compartmentalised into either one orother concept. As a result, differing legal consequences would follow from theclassification: the rules of natural justice being less rigorous in the case of theexercise of power by those bodies which were deemed to exercise ‘quasi-judicial’ or ‘administrative’ functions.
An early expression of the requirement of a hearing is to be found in
Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works (1893). There, Cooper had – without
giving notice to the Board, as required by law – started to erect a house. TheBoard had the power to demolish buildings built without the requisitepermission, and exercised their power so to do. Cooper applied for – andrecovered – damages from the Board for trespass to his property. Byles J heldthat the plaintiff should have been given a hearing before the Board exercisedtheir powers, even though there was no express statutory requirement thatthey do so:
... although there are no positive words in a statute requiring that the party
shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law shall supply the omission ofthe legislature.
71
However, such a dynamic and protective judicial attitude was not to be found,
for example, in Nakkuda Ali v Jayaratne (1951). In Nakkuda Ali , the Privy
Council held that there was no duty to give a hearing to a dealer when hisChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
90269 See Gordon, 1933.

71 See Steeple v Derbyshire County Council (1984); but cf R v Amber Valley District Council ex
parte Jackson (1984). See, also, R v Hendon Rural District Council ex parte Chorley (1933).

The Grounds for Judicial Review
licence was under consideration – and was revoked – because the statute
made no such express provision and the court concluded that there was noduty on the licensing board to ‘act judicially’. 
Judicial rejection of the classifications
Ridge v Baldwin (1964) represents a classic case which reveals judicial
insistence on procedural fairness irrespective of the type of body determininga question.
72Ridge, the Chief Constable of Brighton, had been suspended
from duty following charges of conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice.Despite Ridge having been cleared of any allegations against him, the judgemade comments which were critical of Ridge’s conduct. Subsequently, Ridgewas dismissed from the force.
73Ridge was not invited to attend the meeting
at which the decision to dismiss him was reached, although he was later givenan opportunity to appear before the committee which confirmed its earlierdecision. Ridge appealed to the Home Secretary,
74who dismissed his appeal.
Ridge then sought a declaration that the dismissal was ultra vires, on the basis
that the committee had violated the rules of natural justice. The followingextract is taken from Lord Reid’s judgment, in which the opportunity wastaken to review the doctrine.
The principle of audi alteram partem goes back many centuries in our law and
appears in a multitude of judgments of judges of the highest authority. In
modern times opinions have sometimes been expressed to the effect thatnatural justice is so vague as to be almost meaningless ... It appears to me thatone reason why the authorities on natural justice have been found difficult toreconcile is that insufficient attention has been paid to the great differencebetween various kinds of cases in which it has been sought to apply theprinciple. What a minister ought to do in considering objections to a schememay be very different from what a watch committee ought to do in consideringwhether to dismiss a chief constable ... [p 64]
... I would think that the authority was wholly in favour of the appellant, but
the respondent’s argument was mainly based on what has been said in anumber of fairly recent cases dealing with different subject matter. Those casesdeal with the decisions of ministers, officials and bodies of various kinds whichadversely affected property rights or privileges of persons who had noopportunity or no proper opportunity of presenting their cases before thedecisions were given ... [p 68]
Lord Reid proceeded to discuss the authorities in relation to differing
functions which had led to the judicial conclusion that differing cases required

Commission for Racial Equality ex parte Cottrell and Rothon (1980).

different levels of respect for the requirement of a hearing, and concluded
that:
... So I would hold that the power of dismissal in the Act of 1882 could not then
have been exercised and cannot now be exercised until the watch committeehave informed the constable of the grounds on which they propose to proceedand given him a proper opportunity to present his case in defence ... [p 79]
75
The right to a hearing founded a challenge in Re Pergamon Press Ltd (1971),76
in which the directors of two companies refused to answer questions unless
given a judicial-style hearing. The court ruled, however, that, although theinspectors appointed to investigate the companies were under a duty to actfairly, this must be weighed against the interests of good administration.
The duty to act ‘fairly’ and concept of ‘legitimate expectation’
Irrespective of the labelling attached to the body in question, there exists aduty to ‘act fairly’. This principle can be clearly seen in the case of Re HK (An
Infant) (1967), wherein it was held that, whilst immigration officers were notobliged to hold a hearing before deciding an immigrant’s status, they werenevertheless under an obligation to act fairly. The duty to give a hearing willbe higher if a ‘legitimate expectation’ has been created in the mind of thecomplainant by the public body concerned.
77
A legitimate expectation will arise in the mind of the complainant
wherever he or she has been led to understand – by the words or actions ofthe decision maker – that certain procedures will be followed in reaching adecision. The complainant may have been led to believe, for example, thatthere would be an oral hearing, or that he would be able to make formalrepresentations. Where such expectations have been created, the decisionmaker is not free simply to ignore the procedures which have been indicated.Two considerations apply to legitimate expectations. The first is where anindividual or group has been led to believe that a certain procedure willapply. The second is where an individual or group relies upon a policy orguidelines which have previously governed an area of executive action. 
The Court of Appeal ruled in R (Bibi) v Newham LBC (2001) that a local
authority which made promises which gave rise to legitimate expectationsthat the applicants would be provided with accommodation with security oftenure had to be honoured to the extent that the expectation was taken intoaccount when allocating the applicants’ position on the housing list. TheChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
90475 See, further, Craig, 1994, Chapter 8.3; Wade and Forsyth, 1994, pp 494–575.
76 See, also, Maxwell v Department of Trade (1974).
77 The courts are also concerned to ensure that government proposals which will affect
individual citizens are fairly presented in order to enable objectors to address the issue
in question. In R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Richmond upon Thames London
Borough Council and Others (No 4) (1994), the Court of Appeal ruled that the
government’s proposals to restrict night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted hadbeen fairly set out in consultations documents.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
applicants were refugees and accepted by the authority as homeless. The
authority wrongly thought that it was under a duty to provideaccommodation with security of tenure. However, the promise that suchaccommodation would be provided founded a legitimate expectation whichhad to be considered.
However, while the concept of legitimate expectation has, according to the
Court of Appeal, achieved an important place in developing the law ofadministrative fairness, whether such an expectation has been raised isdependent upon the circumstances in which statements are made, andwhether in an instant case they could be taken as propounding a policy ormerely statements applicable to particular cases. In R v Secretary for the Home
Department ex parte Behluli (1998), the Home Secretary had ordered the
removal of the applicant to Italy under section 2 of the Asylum andImmigration Act 1996. The applicant argued that he had a legitimateexpectation that his case would be dealt with in accordance with the DublinConvention.
78The Court of Appeal ruled, however, that the statements relied
on by the applicant fell short of the requirements necessary to establish to therequisite degree of clarity and certainty that the Secretary of State would dealwith all applications for asylum in accordance with the Convention and not inaccordance with the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and rules madethereunder.
The giving of assurances
By way of illustration, in Attorney General for Hong Kong v Ng Yuen Shiu (1983),
the applicant had been an illegal immigrant for some years. He waseventually detained and an order was made for his deportation. The Directorof Immigration had given a public undertaking that illegal immigrants such asNg Yuen Shiu would not be deported without first being interviewed. Theassurance was also given that ‘each case would be treated on its merits’. LordFraser of Tullybelton in the Privy Council ruled that there was no generalright in an alien to have a hearing in accordance with the rules of naturaljustice. Nevertheless, a ‘legitimate expectation’ had been created in the mindof the immigrant and, accordingly, breach of the requirement of fairnessjustified the order for his removal from Hong Kong to be quashed. A publicbody cannot give undertakings which conflict with its statutory duty. In R v
Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte Preston (1985),
79the House of Lords
ruled that if it should do so, it was in principle entitled to go back on itsundertaking. However, if the authority made an assurance and then exercisedits statutory power in a manner which caused unfairness, that exercise couldbe viewed as an abuse of power and the undertaking upheld by the courts.
90578 Relating to the removal of persons to safe third countries.
79 See, also, R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd
(1990).

Fairness may involve the due consultation of interested parties before their
rights are affected by decisions. For example, in R v Liverpool Corporation ex
parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators Association (1972), the corporation had given
undertakings to the taxi drivers to the effect that their licences would not be
revoked without prior consultation. When the corporation acted in breach ofthis undertaking, the court ruled that it had a duty to comply with itscommitment to consultation.
80
On legitimate expectations, the Court of Appeal considered the power of
the Home Secretary to re-certify a country as safe for asylum seekers in R
(Zeqirl) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2001). The Home Secretary
decided to remove an asylum seeker to Germany, and the Court of Appealruled that although he had power to re-certify Germany as a safe country, toremove the asylum seeker to Germany was unlawful since it frustrated theasylum seeker’s legitimate expectation that his application would besubstantively determined in the United Kingdom.
81
The Court of Appeal in R v North and East Devon Health Authority ex parte
Coughlan (1999)82ruled that a decision by a health authority to close a home
for the severely disabled at which the applicant resided, and to transfer her tothe care of a local authority, was unlawful. The applicant had been assured bythe predecessor to the health authority that the home was her home for life,thus creating a legitimate expectation which no public interest overrode.Furthermore, under Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights, everyonehad a right to respect for his home and the judge had been entitled to treat thecase as one in which there would be an unjustifiable breach of Article 8.
The Coughlan decision has significant implications for judicial review. The
Court of Appeal moved beyond the traditional test of procedural impropriety,thereby developing the law relating to legitimate expectations. The Court ofAppeal identified three differing situations which would give rise to differingapproaches to review. The first related to a public body which had to considerprevious policy or representations before changing that policy. Here, reviewon Wednesbury grounds was appropriate. The second class of case concerned
the legitimate expectation of being consulted, in which case the court wouldlook closely at the reasons for the change of policy and whether that decisionwas fair. The third class of case is where a promise by a public body hadbrought about a ‘substantive legitimate expectation’ on the part of theapplicant. Here the court’s approach would be more intensive. It would, inChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
90680 See, also, R v Ministry of Defence ex parte Walker (2000) in which the House of Lords ruled
that a soldier injured in action in the former Yugoslavia was not entitled to
compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. A policy adopted in1994 excluding compensation for death or injury resulting from war operations ormilitary action in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia was not irrational. The applicanthad been given no assurances and the only legitimate expectation he had was that theMinistry of Defence would apply the policy in force at the time of his injury.
81 Relying on R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Besnik Gashi (1999).
82 See Craig and Schonberg, 2000; Roberts, 2001; Elliott, 2000; Hilson, 2002.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
Craig and Schonberg’s analysis, ‘decide whether the frustration of the
expectation was so unfair that to take a new and different course of actionwould amount to an abuse of power’, and once the legitimate expectation hadbeen established, ‘the court would have the task of “weighing therequirements of fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for thechange of policy”’.
83Accordingly, there are two standards of review, one
where the decision was irrational in the Wednesbury sense, and one on the
basis of abuse of power, which was for the court to determine. Policy changeson the part of public authorities are not unusual nor unlawful in the generalcase, nor should the courts, as the Court of Appeal recognised, jeopardise ‘theimportant principle that the executive’s policy making powers should not betrammelled’. Where, however, a substantive legitimate expectation has arisen– as in Coughlan – through the express promise made in precise terms, and
was relied on by the applicant, the decision was unlawful.
Acting in a manner so as to create an expectation
A public body may act in a manner which creates an expectation in the mindof a person or body. For example, in R v Secretary of State for Health ex parte US
Tobacco International Inc (1992), the company had opened a factory in 1985,
with a government grant, for the production of oral snuff. The governmentmade the grant available notwithstanding its awareness of the health risks ofthe product. In 1988, however, the government – having received furtheradvice from a committee – announced its intention to ban snuff. The companysought judicial review, relying on a legitimate expectation based on thegovernment’s action. The court ruled, however, that, even though theapplicant had a legitimate expectation, that expectation could not override thepublic interest in banning a harmful substance.
The existence of policies and/or guidance
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Asif Mahmood Khan
(1984), the Home Office had published a circular stating the criteria to be used
for determining whether a child could enter the United Kingdom. When theapplicant sought to bring his nephew into the United Kingdom from Pakistan,entry was refused. In judicial review proceedings, it was established that theimmigration rules did not specify any particular criteria, but that the HomeDepartment’s circular did so specify. It was also established that the criteriaused in determining whether to allow the child into the country were differentfrom that provided under the circular. The Home Secretary had acted ultra
vires : he had created legitimate expectation and was not free to employ
different criteria.
84
90783Coughlan , para 57, cited in Craig and Schonberg, 2000.
84 Cf Re Findlay (1985), wherein the doctrine was limited merely to an expectation that
prisoners would have their cases individually considered according to whatever policy
the minister chose to adopt.

A further challenge to the powers of the Home Secretary can be seen in R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Ruddock (1987). The Home
Secretary had authorised the interception of telephone calls without statutory
authority.85The basis on which the Home Secretary decided to intercept calls
was provided in a circular. The applicant claimed that the Home Secretaryhad failed to follow the criteria laid down in the circular. The court held thatthe applicant had a legitimate expectation that the criteria would be followedbut, nevertheless, the applicant lost the case because it was held that theminister could have come to the judgment that the criteria were applied andthat he was not acting unreasonably. The decision, which appears to weakenthe binding nature of legitimate expectations, is explainable in light of thealleged national security aspects of the case. The applicant had been a leadingmember of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which the governmentfeared was being influenced by the Communist Party.
The concept of legitimate expectation based on the existence of procedural
guidelines may also be seen in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil
Service (1985), where it was clear that, had issues of national security not been
involved, the courts would have protected the legitimate expectations ofemployees at GCHQ not to have their right to be members of a trades unionremoved without consultation. However, there remains uncertainty about theextent to which judges will accept and apply the concept of legitimateexpectation.
A change made to a policy which had been embedded in an agreement
between prison inmates and prison authorities was considered by the Court ofAppeal in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another ex parte
Hargreaves and Others (1996). The agreement stated that prisoners could apply
for home leave after serving one third of their sentence, subject to goodbehaviour. The Secretary of State decided, however, that only prisoners whohad served half their sentence could apply for home leave. Hargreaves andothers unsuccessfully applied for judicial review. They subsequently appealedto the Court of Appeal. 
The Court of Appeal held that the agreement between the prison inmates
and the prison authorities did not give rise to a legitimate expectation whichcould be enforced by judicial review. Furthermore, the Home Secretary’sdecision to change the policy was not to be tested against the overall fairnessof that decision, but rather whether the policy was unreasonable in theWednesbury sense. On that test, the Home Secretary’s decision was not
unlawful. The Court of Appeal expressed regret, however, that the documentson which the prisoners relied were ‘other than completely clear andunambiguous’, and called for greater clarity in the future.Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
90885 The case was decided before the Interception of Communications Act 1985 was
implemented.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
Uncertainty in the doctrine of fairness
The principles of fairness have not, as can be seen above, been given either
universal or consistent interpretations. For example, in McInnes v Onslow Fane
(1978) ,Megarry VC stated that:
... the further the situation is away from anything that resembles a judicial or
quasi-judicial decision, and the further the question is removed from what mayreasonably be called a justiciable question, the more appropriate it is to rejectan expression which includes the word justice and to use instead terms such as‘fairness’ or the ‘duty to act fairly’. [p 1530]
In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (1985), the House
of Lords once again turned to the apparent differences in the concepts, Lord
Roskill seemingly rejecting the phrase ‘natural justice’ in favour of the duty to‘act fairly’. Lord Roskill asserted that:
The phrase [natural justice] might now be allowed to find a permanent resting
place and be better replaced by speaking of a duty to act fairly. But the latterphrase must not in its turn be misunderstood or misused. It is not for thecourts to determine whether a particular policy or particular decisions taken infulfilment of that policy are fair. They are only concerned with the manner inwhich those decisions have been taken and the extent of the duty to act fairlywill vary greatly from case to case as indeed the decided cases since 1950consistently show. Many features will come into place including the nature ofthe decision and the relationship of those involved on either side before thedecision was taken. [p 414]
In Hardie v City of Edinburgh Council (2000), a teacher who was informed that
he would be removed from the list of supply teachers and not employed again
following allegations by a pupil of professional misconduct, and considerationof reports concluding that such misconduct had taken place, was entitled tojudicial review. Natural justice required that fair notice of the allegationsmade and an opportunity to comment on the reports should have been given,and that the report should have been communicated to the applicant before adecision was reached.
In Director General of Fair Trading v Proprietary Association of Great Britain
(2000), the Court of Appeal took the opportunity to review the test of bias aslaid down by the House of Lords in R v Gough (1993) to determine whether
that test was in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights. Thecourt ruled that a ‘modest adjustment’ of the Gough test would bring it into
line with the European Court. The correct approach to be applied was, first,for the court to ascertain all the circumstances which had a bearing on thesuggestion that a judge was biased. It then had to ask whether thosecircumstances would lead a ‘fair-minded and informed observer’ to concludethat there was a real possibility, or a real danger – the two being the same –that a tribunal was biased.

The right to make representations
Inevitably, the extent to which the individual is enabled to make
representations to a decision making body will be inextricably linked to thequestion of the right to a hearing. Where there exists no right to an oralhearing, the question becomes one of the extent to which – and means bywhich – the view of the individual can be put to the decision makingauthority. It may well be the case that the opportunity to make writtensubmissions will satisfy the requirements for justice and fairness. For example,in Lloyd v McMahon (1987), local government councillors were in breach of
their statutory duty to set the level of local rates. When the district auditorcame to determine the issue, the applicants claimed the right to an oralhearing, and that the absence of such a hearing amounted to a breach of therules of natural justice and was, accordingly, ultra vires. The court disagreed,
holding that, since the auditor had given notice of the case against them andhad considered written representations from them, he had acted fairly and,accordingly, lawfully. 
The requirements of fairness mean that where a body was exercising penal
powers which involved the imposition of a penalty which was more severethan would normally be expected, it had to give the person affected theopportunity of making representations on the issue. The High Court so heldinR (Gutta) v General Medical Council (2001). The Medical Council had found
Dr Gutta guilty of serious professional misconduct and resolved to have hername erased from the register and that her suspension should take effectimmediately, rather than after an appeal had been heard, as was normal. TheCouncil was under a duty to give notice of its intention to make such an order,give the opportunity to make representations and give adequate reasons forreaching its conclusion.
The right to question the ‘other side’
It is not invariably the case that, where there is to be an oral hearing, it shouldbe conducted according to the strict rules which would apply in a court oflaw. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that a party will be entitled tocross-examine the ‘other side’. However, in Errington v Wilson (1995) ,it was
made clear that Justices of the Peace must observe the rules of natural justiceand, in particular, allow cross-examination under certain circumstances. Afood authority had seized batches of cheese which it believed to becontaminated with listeria monocytogenes. The authority then sought adestruction order from the justice of the peace. The magistrate refused toallow cross-examination of witnesses called by the authority. The court heldthat, given the nature of the proceedings, the magistrate was required to allowcross-examination if the proceedings were to be fair; and that, given thedifference of opinion between experts on crucial points, Errington had beendenied natural justice.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
The admissibility of evidence and attendance of witnesses
In R v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison ex parte St Germain (No 2) (1979), prisoners
who had been involved in a prison riot were charged with breaches of the
Prison Rules. In the course of the hearing, hearsay evidence was given to thecourt on behalf of a number of officers who were unable to attend the hearing.The decision of guilt on the charges was challenged by judicial reviewproceedings, on the basis that the Board of Visitors had breached the rules ofnatural justice. Lane LJ, while not ruling that hearsay evidence could never beadmissible, nevertheless ruled that, in the particular circumstance of the case,the Board should have ruled the hearsay evidence inadmissible. The decisionof the Board was quashed by order of certiorari. Similar issues were underscrutiny in R v Commissioner for Racial Equality ex parte Cottrell and Rothon
(1980). The Commissioner had received a complaint of unlawfuldiscrimination by Messrs Cottrell and Rothon, a firm of estate agents. Thecompany had been given the opportunity to make representations – bothwritten and oral – to the commissioners. No witnesses were available at thehearing. Nevertheless, the Commission issued a non-discrimination notice.
86
The company sought to have the decision quashed, relying in part on R v
Board of Visitors of Hull Prison ex parte St Germain (No 2) (1979) .Noting the
absence of any statutory requirement to provide an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses in the course of a hearing, and distinguishing between thefacts of St Germain , the Court of Appeal ruled that there was no breach in the
rules relating to fairness.
In R v Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ex parte Guinness plc (1990), the
Takeover Panel refused to grant an adjournment of the inquisitorialproceedings in order to allow witnesses to attend. The court expressed anxietyabout this refusal, but declined to hold that the Panel had acted unlawfully. 
A different conclusion was reached, in R v Army Board of the Defence
Council ex parte Anderson (1991). The applicant for judicial review had made
allegations of racial discrimination
87which resulted in him taking absence
without leave. Members of the Board considered his allegation ofdiscrimination on the basis of circulated papers, and did not meet for thepurpose of reaching its decision. The complainant had requested, but beenrefused, an oral hearing, and had also requested, but been refused, thedisclosure of documents relating to his case. The Board decided that whilstthere was some prima facie evidence of discrimination, it was insufficient to
warrant either an apology or an award of compensation. Anderson soughtjudicial review of the Army Board’s decision. Counsel for the Board revertedto the distinction between administrative and judicial functions. Taylor LJ, inthe course of ruling that such a distinction was unnecessary, held that, should

87 Under ibid.

the distinction have been a necessary one, he would characterise the role of
the Army Board, in connection with the complaint, as judicial rather thanadministrative. Applying the principles established in Lloyd v McMahon
(1987), and rejecting the arguments advanced by the Army Board, Taylor LJruled that four principles applied to the standard of fairness required in ahearing such as that of the Board: 
(1) There must be a proper hearing of the complaint in the sense that the
board must consider ... all the relevant evidence and contentions before
reaching its conclusion. This means, in my view, that the members of theBoard must meet ...
(2) The hearing does not necessarily have to be an oral hearing in all cases ...
Provided that they [the board] achieve the degree of fairness appropriateto their task it is for them to decide how they will proceed and there is norule that fairness always requires an oral hearing ...What it [the board] cannot do ... is to have an inflexible policy not to holdoral hearings. The board fettered its discretion and failed to consider the requirements foran oral hearing in the present case on its own merits.
(3) The opportunity to have the evidence tested by cross-examination is again
within the Army Board’s discretion. The decision whether to allow it willusually be inseparable from the decision whether to have an oral hearing.The object of the latter will usually be to enable witnesses to be tested incross-examination, although it would be possible to have an oral hearingsimply to hear submissions.
(4) Whether oral or not, there must be what amounts to a hearing of any
complaint under the 1976 Act. This means that the Army Board must havesuch a complaint investigated, consider all the material gathered in theinvestigation, give the complainant an opportunity to respond to it andconsider his response.
On the duty of disclosure of documents, Taylor LJ ruled that:
Because of the nature of the Army Board’s function pursuant to the 1976 Act, ...I consider that a soldier complainant under that Act should be shown all thematerial seen by the board, apart from any documents for which publicinterest immunity
88can properly be claimed.
The decision of the board was quashed by order of certiorari.
The rights of prisoners have also been scrutinised in relation to the
requirement that they have sufficient information in order to challenge a
Home Secretary’s decision as to their detention or release. Under the CriminalJustice Act 1991, the Home Secretary has a statutory duty to release, on thedirection of the Parole Board, discretionary life prisoners after they haveserved a ‘tariff period’ (section 34). The period to be served is considered bythe trial judge. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody
(1993), the House of Lords ruled that the prisoner was entitled to know thelength of the tariff period recommended by the trial judge, and other relevantChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
91288 On public interest immunity, see Chapter 11.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
factors, in order that he may make written representation to the Home
Secretary concerning the date fixed for consideration by the Parole Board ofhis sentence.
89The failure to respect the entitlement to know the period
recommended in order to make written submissions, led to the HomeSecretary’s decision being quashed. 
In R v Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Slot (1997), a property
owner was denied natural justice where a planning authority determining herapplication did not allow her to make independent representations, andrefused to give the applicant a copy of objections lodged. The decision wasquashed. Further, in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte
McAvoy (1997), a prisoner whose security status was under review, had the
right to the ‘gist’ of the reports to the review body, in order that he couldmake representations knowing the case he had to meet. 
The availability of legal representation
Whether or not legal representation is available as of right will also dependupon the nature of the hearing and the nature of the rights affected. There isno general right to legal representation and, in some cases, it may prove to beeither unnecessary or counterproductive to the proceedings and, accordingly,the courts have been unwilling to concede a general right to representation.
90
Where the proceedings are before a tribunal, the right to be represented is atthe discretion of the tribunal.
91The general principle, according to the Royal
Commission on Legal Services, is that ‘it is desirable that every applicantbefore any tribunal should be able to present his case in person or to obtainrepresentation’.
92
Whereas legal representation is rarely denied before tribunals,93such
representation is inextricably linked to the financial means of the applicant orto the availability of Legal Aid (now referred to as Legal Help). It may bemore appropriate, in many instances, for applicants to be represented by non-lawyers. A range of organisations offer representation. The Citizens AdviceBureaux, trades unions, social workers, specialist agencies,
94the Free
Representation Unit, friends or relatives may all be allowed to appear beforetribunals. The essential criterion for representation is that the tribunal should

not adopt a rigid policy, but rather should exercise a genuine discretion in
relation to the availability of representation.95
Failure to give reasons96
According to Lord Denning MR, the giving of reasons is ‘one of thefundamentals of good administration’.
97Unless a decision maker provides
adequate information as to the basis on which a decision has been reached,any possible protection which could be given to an aggrieved person isadversely affected. 
Under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992, there exists a statutory duty to
give reasons, on request, where decisions are reached by tribunals, publicinquiries, or under specific statutes. Under common law, however, there is nosuch duty,
98although the argument that there should be such a duty is strong.
A decision making body is under a ‘general duty’ to give reasons, and anydeparture from the requirement to give reasons will require soundjustification. Where an authority fails to give reasons for a decision which ischallenged subsequently by judicial review proceedings, the failure to givereasons may cause the court to consider that there were no good reasonswhatsoever for the decision. Lord Keith expressed it thus:
... if all other known facts and circumstances appear to point overwhelmingly
in favour of a different decision, the decision maker who has given no reasonscannot complain if the court draws the inference that he has no rational reasonfor his decision.
99
The courts have developed a number of exceptions to the general rule that no
reasons need be given at common law. The courts may hold, for example, thata failure to give reasons will prejudice an applicant’s chances of successfullyapplying for judicial review,
100or that a failure to give reasons amounts to
arbitrariness,101or that legitimate expectations have been created which
demand that any departure from that expectation be explained or, moresweepingly, that in the interests of fairness, reasons must be given.
In R v Civil Service Appeal Board ex parte Cunningham (1991), for example,
the Court of Appeal, while again stating that there was no general duty togive reasons, held that the Civil Service Appeal Board – which determined theapplicant’s compensation for unfair dismissal – was under a duty to givereasons, for its powers were analogous to the judicial powers of an industrialChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Grounds for Judicial Review
tribunal. Fairness demanded that the Board give reasons, in the same manner
as required for tribunals.102
The duty to give reasons must now be evaluated in light of the House of
Lords’ decision in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody
(1993). As seen above, pp 912–13, in Doody, the applicants, who were serving
mandatory life sentences, sought information as to the basis on which thedecision concerning the period for their mandatory detention had beenreached. The House of Lords laid down two justifications for the requirementthat information be given. First, if reasons were not given to the applicants,the possibility of their successfully applying for judicial review would befrustrated. Secondly, a failure to give reasons adversely affected the concept offairness. Lord Mustill, while acknowledging that there remained no generalduty to give reasons, stated that a duty would be implied under certaincircumstances. Where, as in Doody , the applicant did not know the reasons for
a decision, it was impossible to make any effective representations in supportof his case. Without the knowledge of any case against him, the applicant wasdenied the very information which would found the basis of makingrepresentations in support of his case. The Home Secretary was, accordingly,under a duty to provide reasons both on the basis that the giving of reasonswas a prerequisite to an application for judicial review, and on the basis ofrequirements of fairness. 
InR v Ministry of Defence ex parte Murray (1997), the Divisional Court ruled
that, although there was no general overriding principle of law whichrequired decision makers to give reasons for their decisions, the duty offairness required that reasons be given, where demanded by thecircumstances of the case. The applicant had been convicted by court martialof wounding. The court martial reached its conclusion and passed sentencewithout giving reasons. The applicant’s conduct, which was ‘entirely out ofcharacter’, and to which he pleaded guilty, was caused by ingestion of an anti-malarial drug. Where there was no explicit duty of fairness in statute, thecourts would require that reasons be given where fairness demanded it. Inthis case, the applicant, his regiment and his family were entitled to reasons. 
In R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ex parte Leatherland and
Others (2000), the High Court ruled that the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Authority was obliged as a matter of procedural fairness to provide properreasons, together with at least the gist of any supporting evidence, for itsdecisions to reduce or refuse claims for compensation. A practice ofwithholding such material until the day of any appeal hearing was badadministration and unfair. 
However, not all bodies will be under a duty to give reasons on the basis
of fairness. In R v Universities Funding Council ex parte Institute of Dental Surgery
915102 See, also, R v Parole Board ex parte Wilson (1992).

(1994) ,for example, the Divisional Court ruled that the Higher Education
Funding Council was not under a duty to give reasons as to why an academic
institution was given a downgraded research grading which resulted in a lossto the Institute of research funds. Such matters were, in the court’s opinion,matters of academic judgment, and a duty to give reasons for a decision couldnot, in this case, be founded on the requirements of fairness alone.
103Sedley J
stated that there were two classes of case emerging. The first class wasexemplified in the Doody case, where the nature of the process requires, in the
interests of fairness, reasons to be given. The second class is illustrated by Ex
parte Cunningham (1992), in which the majority of the court held that there was
something peculiar to the case which required reasons to be given in theinterests of fairness. In the Institute of Dental Surgery case, provided the
decision was based purely on academic judgment, and did not involve anyirrelevant or improper factors being taken into account, the decision wouldnot be impugned on the basis that reasons had not been given for the decision.TRS Allan is critical of the decision. In his view, ‘if the requirement of reasons,where it exists, reflects the demands of fairness and reasonableness, its denialin the present case must cause one to doubt whether the Institute was treatedeither fairly or reasonably’ (1994, p 210).
In Selvanathan v General Medical Council (2000), the court ruled that the
Professional Conduct Committee of the General Medical Council shouldalways give a brief explanation for their determination, whether or not theyfound a medical practitioner guilty of serious professional misconduct, andtheir decision on the question of penalty. Fairness required that reasons begiven, so that the losing party could decide in an informed fashion whether ornot to accept the decision to appeal against it. Given that the Committee wascomposed of medical practitioners and lay members, it was not expected thatdetailed reasons for their findings of fact be given, and a general explanationof the basis for their determination would be sufficient in most cases.
The duty of the Crown Prosecution Service to give reasons for its decisions
was considered by the Divisional Court in R v Director of Public Prosecutions ex
parte Manning (2000). The applicant’s brother had died of asphyxia while
being restrained by prison officers whilst on remand in prison. At a coroner’sinquest, the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. However, the CrownProsecution Service concluded that, while there was a prima facie case against a
prison officer, there was no realistic prospect of a successful prosecution. Theapplicant then requested the reasons for the Crown Prosecution Service’sdecision, but was refused. He then sought judicial review. It was held thatwhile there was no absolute obligation on the Service to give reasons for aChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
916103 See, also, R v University College London ex parte Idriss (1999), in which it was held that it
was ‘very doubtful’ whether a university’s refusal to admit an applicant for entry to a
course was susceptible to judicial review and that there was no duty to give reasonseither at common law or under the university’s own statutes.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
decision not to prosecute, a violent death in custody gave rise to great
concern. Further, since a jury had returned a verdict of unlawful killingimplicating an identifiable person, there was an expectation of a plausibleexplanation for the decision and of solid grounds to support the decision. 
In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Al Fayed (1997) ,the
court of first instance ruled that there was no duty to give reasons for refusingapplications for naturalisation under section 44(2) of the British NationalityAct 1981. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeal ruled that the HomeSecretary had a duty to indicate to the applicant the area(s) of concern onwhich he was basing his refusal, in order that the applicant may have anopportunity to allay the Home Secretary’s concerns. The Home Secretary’sdecision was quashed. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte
Moon (1995), the court ruled that the Secretary of State’s refusal to explain his
reasons for concluding that the entry of the Reverend Sun Myung Moonwould not be conducive to the public good was unfair and contrary to therules of natural justice. 
The duty of a professional judge to give reasons was upheld by the Court
of Appeal in Flanner v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000), setting aside the
judgment of the court in a claim for damages for professional negligence. Ingeneral, it was the duty of a judge to give reasons; the extent of the dutywould depend on the circumstances, but, where the dispute involvedopposing reasons and analysis, the judge must explain why he preferred onecase over the other.
104In Stefan v General Medical Council (1999), the health
committee of the General Medical Council had suspended the applicantindefinitely because of her medical condition. No reasons were given. Thecourt stated that the common law rule against a general duty to give reasonswas changing and might have to be reconsidered in light of the Human RightsAct 1998 (on which, see below). Although there was no general duty to givereasons, nevertheless, in light of the nature of the appeal and the importancefor the practitioner, they ought to have done so. 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND JUDICIAL REVIEW105
The doctrine of proportionality106
From a judicial review perspective, the Human Rights Act 1998, whichincorporates Convention rights into domestic law, presages significant
917104 See Practice Direction [1999] 1 WLR 2.
105 See Jowell, 2000; Craig, 2001.
106 See Jowell and Lester, ‘Proportionality: neither novel nor dangerous’, in Jowell and
Oliver, 1988; Jowell, 2000; Wong, 2000.

developments.107The Human Rights Act provides an additional basis on
which the legality of actions of public authorities will be tested. The Act
provides for judicial review to extend to the review of administrative action todetermine its compatibility with Convention requirements. As has been seenabove, a fundamental concept utilised in domestic judicial review cases hasconventionally been that of ‘reasonableness’.
108At issue is whether a public
body, in its exercise of administrative discretion, has acted within the boundsof reasonableness conferred by the legislation, under which are subsumed theconcepts of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Both theEuropean Court of Justice of the European Community and the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights – which are separate institutions and operate underseparate jurisdictions
109 – have long employed the concept of
‘proportionality’, and it is this concept – traditionally been regarded withsome suspicion by domestic judges – which has now become applicable.
110
The doctrine of proportionality is one which confines the limits of the
exercise of power to means which are proportional to the objective to bepursued. The doctrine has taken firm roots in the jurisprudence of, forexample, the United States of America, Canada and the law of manycontinental European countries. Both the European Court of Justice of theEuropean Community
111(ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights112
adopt proportionality as a test against which to measure the legality of actionsof authorities.
113InR v Home Secretary ex parte Brind (1991), the House of
Lords was not yet prepared to accept that the concept represented a separateand distinct head of judicial review.
Where issues of European Community law or the European Convention
on Human Rights are involved, the doctrine is one which must be consideredif the English interpretation of European law is to be consistent with that ofthe European Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights. In Stoke-on-
Trent City Council v B & Q plc (1984), for example, Hoffmann J was prepared to
adopt the ECJ’s proportionality test when considering the compatibility of theShops Act 1950 and the free trade provisions of the EC Treaty.
Consistent with the requirements of the Convention, any action which
prima facie violates protected rights, must be justified on the basis that the
infringement is justifiable on the grounds set out in the Convention Articles:Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law
918107 On the status of the Convention before the Human Rights Act came into force, see
Chapter 19. See, also, R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Hussain
Ahmed (1999).
108 See Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation (1948).
109 See, further, Chapter 8.
110 Proportionality has, however, been recognised by the Court of Appeal. See, eg , R v
Barnsley Metropolitan BC ex parte Hook (1976); Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd (1976).
111 See Chapters 8 and 9.
112 See Chapter 19.
113 See, eg, Dudgeon v United Kingdom (1982), discussed in Chapter 19.

The Grounds for Judicial Review
thus, the action taken must be judged according to whether or not that action
was proportionate to the objective behind the action. The Convention isreplete with state discretion – the ‘margin of appreciation’ – allied to criteriasuch as ‘necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security,public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention ofdisorder or crime for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection ofrights and freedoms of others’.
114
The time has now been reached and the doctrine of proportionality has
been adopted in domestic courts of law. In Brind , Lord Ackner asked pithily
whether the Secretary of State had ‘used a sledgehammer to crack a nut’. Inseveral pre-Human Rights Act cases, it is clear that the courts have been usingthe doctrine of proportionality but without making explicit references thereto.For example, in R v Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council ex parte Hook (1976),
a market stall holder had had his licence revoked for urinating in public. LordDenning MR quashed the decision, partly on the basis that the penalty – theloss of the licence – was disproportionate to the ‘offence’.
115
Proportionality was also evident in R v Chief Constable of Sussex ex parte
International Trader’s Ferry Ltd (1999). In that case, judicial review had been
sought regarding the Chief Constable’s decision to restrict the deployment ofpolice officers to assist the exporters, who were being obstructed bydemonstrators. In the House of Lords, Lord Slynn stated that when answeringthe question of whether ‘appropriate measures’ had been taken, the correctapproach was to ask ‘whether the steps taken were proportionate’, and thatthe Chief Constable had ‘shown here that what he did in providing policeassistance was proportionate to what was required’. In his judgment, LordCook took the opportunity to consider proportionality and the Wednesbury
test of unreasonableness, stating that ‘the European concepts ofproportionality and margin of appreciation produce the same result as whatare commonly called Wednesbury principles’, and re-defined the
reasonableness test to the more simple formula of ‘whether the decision inquestion was one which a reasonable authority could reach’.
With the Human Rights Act 1998, proportionality moves centre stage. In
interpreting the Act, section 2 requires that domestic courts and tribunals‘must take into account’ the judgments and decisions of the Court of HumanRights. Under section 6, courts and tribunals are public authorities under theAct and are therefore under a duty not to violate Convention rights.Furthermore, most Convention rights are not absolute and unqualified, butallow states to impose limitations on specified grounds, commonly in theinterests of ‘public safety’ or ‘national security’. Restrictions on the exercise ofrights – derogations – must also commonly be ‘prescribed by law’ and‘necessary in a democratic society’.
116The combined effect of these provisions
919114 ECHR, Article 8(2).
115 Consider, also, Wheeler v Leicester City Council (1985), discussed below.
116 See Chapter 19 for the text of Convention Articles.

necessitates that courts follow the reasoning of the Court of Human Rights,
and that includes the doctrine of proportionality. The domestic courts havetraditionally been wary of the doctrine, on the basis that it requires judges togo beyond an analysis of the legality of the decision making process on thegrounds of legality, rationality and procedural propriety, and to address twofurther questions. The first is, where a breach of a right is found to haveoccurred, was the offending action justified as being both necessary andproportionate to the objective being sought? This requires the courts not onlyto look at the processes involved in reaching decisions, but to evaluatewhether on the facts the decision maker adopted the approach which leastundermined the right in question. That exercise involves the judges looking tothe merits of decisions, rather than the process of decision making – which hasbeen the conventional concern of judicial review – and blurs the line betweenreview and appeal. Constitutionally, that alters the position of the judges vis àvis the executive. 
However, the question arises as to whether the doctrine of proportionality
applies only where fundamental human rights are in issue, or whether it willcome to pervade all aspects of judicial review. Any judgment on that issuewould be premature and must await further case law. However the issue wasaddressed by Lord Slynn in R (Alconbury Developments Ltd and Others) v
Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (2001), where he
stated that:
I consider that even without reference to the Human Rights Act the time has
come to recognise that this principle [proportionality] is part of English law,not only when judges are dealing with [European] Community acts, but alsowhen they are dealing with acts subject to domestic law. Trying to keep theWednesbury principle and proportionality in separate compartments seems to
me to be unnecessary and confusing.
On the other hand, Jeffrey Jowell QC has stated that ‘The new constitutional
approach will not affect all our judicial review. There will no doubt remainareas where traditional techniques of reasoning and justification will suffice toensure standards of legal, fair and reasonable administration based upon thepractical morality familiar to our common law’ (2000, p 682).
The giving of reasons, whether by courts or administrative bodies,
assumes increased importance in light of the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 5of the Convention (the right to liberty and security) expressly states thatpersons arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he or sheunderstands, of the reasons for the arrest. Article 6 of the Convention protectsthe right to a fair trial in the determination of civil rights and obligations or ofcriminal charges. While the giving of reasons is not an explicit requirement inArticle 6, it is implicit in facilitating the right of appeal. 
The judicial review process was scrutinised by the European Court of
Human Rights in Kingsley v United Kingdom (2001). The Court ruled that the
applicant’s right to fair trial, guaranteed by Article 6, had been violated. Theapplicant had been refused a certificate to hold a management position in theChapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Grounds for Judicial Review
gaming industry, by the Gaming Board of Great Britain. He sought judicial
review, alleging bias on the part of a supervisory board. The nature of judicialreview proceedings which restricted the court to examining the quality of thedecision making process rather than the merits of the decision meant that theapplicant had not received a fair trial as required by the Convention. 
The Court examined the composition of the panel which decided that the
applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold a certificate, and concludedthat it did not present the necessary appearance of impartiality to amount toan independent and impartial tribunal. However, the Court went on to assertthat even where an adjudicatory body did not comply with the requirementsof Article 6, there would be no breach of the Article if the proceedings weresubject to ‘subsequent control by a judicial body that had full jurisdiction anddid provide the guarantees of Article 6(1)’. In the judicial review proceedingsthe court considered that even if there had been unconscious bias on the partof the board, its decision had to stand because of the application of thedoctrine of necessity. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the court acceptedthat the applicant had an arguable case, and that there was a real risk of bias,but concluded that the decision had to stand, since the decision could only bemade by the board and could not be delegated to an independent tribunal.The Court of Human Rights ruled that where a complaint was made of a lackof impartiality, the concept of full jurisdiction required that the ‘reviewingcourt not only considered the complaint but had the ability to quash theimpugned decision and to remit the case for a new decision by an impartialbody’. In the present case, the domestic courts were unable to remit the case toan impartial tribunal; neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal had ‘fulljurisdiction’ within the meaning of Article 6 and there was a violation of theConvention.
The Freedom of Information Act 2000
As discussed in Chapter 11, the Freedom of Information Act gives legislativeforce to the Labour government’s commitment to more open government. AnInformation Commissioner has been appointed, with jurisdiction toinvestigate allegations that public authorities and bodies have failed toprovide information and documents requested. The Act, it will be recalled,introduces the principle that information and documents will be disclosed,subject to a test of harm which justifies official non-disclosure. TheCommissioner’s decisions are published and are subject to judicial review.The effect of the Freedom of Information Act on judicial review will, however,arguably be to reduce the number of applications for judicial review, inparticular on the basis of failure to give reasons. This appears to be supportedby the government’s announcement that it did not intend to appeal againstthe decision in the Al Fayed case, but rather indicated that it would give
reasons for refusing citizenship. Judicial review, as seen in the previous
921

chapter, is concerned with the decision making process rather than the merits
of the decision, and provides a discretionary remedy, which requires thedecision maker to reconsider the matter in accordance with the correctprocedure. Provided that the decision making process is in accordance withthe requirements of law and the principles of natural justice, the decision willnot be impugned. Under the Freedom of Information Act, however, where apublic body – which is widely defined – fails to give reasons for its decision,recourse may be had to the Commissioner who has wide ranging powers toinvestigate, and has the power to order disclosure. Where a public bodyrefuses to supply, for example, reasons for its decision, and the Commissionerorders it to disclose reasons, should the public body then continue to refuse todisclose, with no justification, that refusal may be deemed to be analogous tocontempt of court. Furthermore, should the body concerned reveal to theCommissioner that it had no rational basis for its decision, that decision maythen be impugned on the basis of irrationality. The citizen may, accordingly,find a more efficient and effective remedy under the jurisdiction of theCommissioner than the courts. Chapter 25: Constitutional and Administrative Law

CHAPTER 26
INTRODUCTION
In the United Kingdom, the past 30 years have seen a major expansion in
mechanisms for citizens to complain against government departments andother public bodies. When a citizen has a complaint against the administrationof government, that complaint could be pursued in courts or tribunals orthrough parliament via the constituency Member of Parliament. However,these means for the redress of grievances have been proven inadequate and,as a result, alternative and additional mechanisms have been introduced.
The word ‘ombudsman’ is Swedish, and means a representative of the
people. In Sweden, the office of Justitieombudsman was established in 1809.
Finland introduced a similar office in 1919, as did Denmark in 1955. In 1963,Norway followed, with a parliamentary ombudsman, the model which hadbeen adopted by New Zealand in 1962. During the 1970s, countriesthroughout the world adopted some form of office of ombudsman.

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER 
FOR ADMINISTRATION13
The movement towards establishing a Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (or ombudsman) began in 1959. In that year, the Britishsection of the International Commission of Jurists, JUSTICE, established aninquiry into grievances against the administration. The resultant report
14
advocated setting up an additional avenue for the redress of grievances, theoffice being modelled on the same lines as those of the ombudsmen inScandinavian jurisdictions. As the report stated, there appeared to be:
... a continuous flow of relatively minor complaints, not sufficient in
themselves to attract public interest, but nevertheless of great importance tothe individuals concerned, which give rise to feelings of frustration andresentment because of the inadequacy of the existing means of seekingredress.
15
The existing machinery was found wanting: parliamentary Question Time
was inadequate to deal with the volume of problems arising; if a complaintwas made directly to the government department, the departmentinvestigated the complaint; if a Member of Parliament attempted toinvestigate, he could not gain access to all departmental documentation.Accordingly, the report advocated establishing a permanent office,independent of the executive and accountable only to parliament, removablefrom office only after a successful address had been moved to both Houses ofParliament. The report recommended that a select committee should beestablished to consider the Commissioner’s reports and to give parliamentaryauthority to the work of the Commissioner. The report also recommendedthat the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration’s office should beone which supplemented, rather than undermined, existing procedures forcomplaint. Complaints, at least initially, concerning maladministration
16
should be routed through Members of Parliament, rather than directlyaddressed to the Parliamentary Commissioner. This would preserve toMembers of Parliament the opportunity to resolve a matter of complaint but,failing their ability to do so, confer the right to refer the matter to theParliamentary Commissioner for investigation and report.
The government’s response to the report was cautious. Concern was
expressed as to the interference in the running of government,
17and that the
Commissioner’s role would be incompatible with the doctrine of ministerialresponsibility. Furthermore, the government felt that:
92513 See Pugh, 1978. See, also, Clothier, 1984 and 1986.
14 The Citizen and the Administration (the ‘Whyatt Report’), 1961.
15 Ibid, para 76.
16 On which, see below.17 Lord Chancellor, HL Deb Vol 244 Cols 384–85.

... there is already adequate provision under our constitution and
Parliamentary practice for the redress of any genuine complaint ofmaladministration, in particular by means of the citizen’s rights of access toMembers of Parliament.
18
The incoming Labour government, however, accepted the need for an office to
complement the existing complaints machinery.19Thus, in 1967, the
Parliamentary Commissioner Act was passed. Being a constitutionalinnovation, the provisions as to procedure, jurisdiction and powers ofenforcement were restrictive.
The constitutional position of the Commissioner
By 1983, the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration hadbeen operative for 15 years, and the Commissioner
20took the opportunity to
review the working of his office in his annual report. He described his office inthe following manner:
The office of Parliamentary Commissioner stands curiously poised between
the legislature and the executive, while discharging an almost judicial functionin the citizen’s dispute with his government, and yet it forms no part of thejudiciary. It is from the centre of that triangle that I have been able toappreciate the virtues of our unwritten and therefore flexible constitutionalarrangements and still more the goodwill of those men and women, legislatorsand administrators who govern us.
THE COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE
Complaints must be in writing, and made to the constituency Member of
Parliament.21The complaint must be made within 12 months of the day on
which the person became aware of the matters alleged, unless the time periodis extended by the Commissioner, on the basis that an investigation isnecessary.
22The complaint must relate to maladministration and not the
merits of a decision or the policy being pursued. This restriction has led tosome 43 per cent of complaints made being rejected by the Commissioner.
The requirement that complaints be made initially to Members of
Parliament reinforces the view that the Commissioner is a supplement to theparliamentary process rather than a substitute. This restricted right of access,however, causes difficulties for complainants, and is not a model adoptedelsewhere.

ombudsman, complaints are made directly to the ombudsman. Moreover, this
filter mechanism has not been adopted in relation to the Health ServiceCommissioner, the Commissioners for Local Government or the ComplaintsCommissioner for Northern Ireland.
24
Jurisdiction
Section 5(1) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 provides that amember of the public may make a complaint and the Commissioner mayinvestigate that complaint where, subject to the rules on jurisdiction, theperson ‘claims to have sustained injustice in consequence ofmaladministration’.
25Before examining that concept, it must be noted that
there are a number of restrictions to the jurisdiction of the ParliamentaryCommissioner, which result in a large number of complaints each year notbeing investigated.
Excluded matters
The work of the police,26of nationalised industries, the Cabinet Office, Prime
Minister’s Office, Parole Board, tribunals, Bank of England, Criminal InjuriesCompensation Board and government commercial and contractualtransactions are all excluded.
27The Commissioner may not investigate any
matter where the complainant has a right of ‘appeal, reference or review’ to atribunal, or a remedy in any court of law, unless it would be unreasonable toexpect the complainant to have resort to such a remedy.
28The Commissioner
thus has a discretion as to whether or not a complaint should be accepted. Ithas been indicated that, where the legal process would be too cumbersome,slow or expensive in relation to the objective to be gained, the complaint willbe accepted.
29
The interaction between legal proceedings and complaints to the
Commissioner was well illustrated in 1975. The government decided toincrease the licence fee for television sets. In advance of the fee increase,individuals renewed their licences at the existing rate. The Home Office thendecided to revoke the 36,000 licences issued at the cheaper rate. A number ofcomplaints were referred to the Commissioner, who found maladministrationon the part of government, inter alia, for not giving sufficient warning of the
increases and for inefficiency. The Commissioner, however, ruled that thegovernment was acting on legal advice and therefore should not be

sanctioned. Judicial review proceedings were commenced to determine the
lawfulness of the Home Secretary’s decision, as a result of which thecomplainants established a legal remedy.
30It may be argued that the
Commissioner was wrong in exercising his discretionary jurisdiction in thiscase, since it should have been foreseen that an action in judicial review wouldlie.
The departments and matters which the Commissioner is precluded from
investigating are wide ranging. Schedule 3 of the ParliamentaryCommissioner Act 1967 sets out the excluded matters, the most significant ofwhich are:
• Action taken in matters certified by a Secretary of State or other Minister of
the Crown to affect relations or dealings between the government of the
United Kingdom and any other government or any internationalorganisation of States or government.
• Action taken in connection with the administration of the government of
any country or territory outside the United Kingdom which forms part ofHer Majesty’s dominions or in which Her Majesty has jurisdiction.
• Action taken by the Secretary of State under the Fugitive Offenders Act
1967 or the Extradition Act 1989.
• Action taken by or with the authority of the Secretary of State for the
purposes of investigating crime or of protecting the security of the State,including action so taken with respect to passports.
• The commencement or conduct of civil or criminal proceedings before any
court of law in the United Kingdom.
• Any exercise of the prerogative of mercy.
• Action taken in matters relating to contractual or other commercial
transactions ... being transactions of a government department.
• Action taken in respect of appointments or removals, pay, discipline,
superannuation or other personnel matters, in relation to:
the armed forces, any office or employment under the Crown.
31
• The grant of honours, awards or privileges within the gift of the Crown,
including the grant of Royal Charters.
Departments and matters within the Commissioner’s jurisdiction
Schedule 2 of the Act lays down those Departments subject to the jurisdiction
of the Commissioner. The Parliamentary and Health Service CommissionersAct 1987 extended the Commissioner’s jurisdiction to cover some non-departmental bodies, and the complete list of Departments and bodies withinthe Commissioner’s jurisdiction is now found in Schedule 1 to the 1987 Act, asamended by the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1994, which provides thatthe following bodies shall be subject to investigation by the Commissioner:Chapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law

The Commissioner’s discretion
Where a matter falls within the Commissioner’s jurisdiction, the
Commissioner has discretion as to whether to accept the complaint.32Section
5(5) provides that the Commissioner shall act ‘in accordance with his owndiscretion’. Because of the breadth of discretion conferred on theCommissioner, both in relation to accepting complaints and in the conduct ofinvestigations, judicial review of his decisions is unlikely to succeed. Forexample, in Re Fletcher (1970), the applicant sought an order of mandamus to
force the Commissioner to investigate a complaint. The House of Lordsrefused, relying on the broad discretion conferred on the Commissioner bystatute. In R v Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex parte Dyer
(1994), the applicant sought judicial review of the Commissioner’s
investigation into her complaints against the Department of Social Security.The applicant was dissatisfied with a report of the Commissioner and soughtjudicial review on four grounds. The allegations were, first, that theCommissioner had not investigated all her complaints; secondly, that she hadnot been given the opportunity to comment on the draft reports; thirdly, thatthe Commissioner, having heard her complaints, refused to reopen theinvestigations; and, fourthly, that the Commissioner was wrong in holdingthat he could not reopen the inquiry. The Queen’s Bench Division held that ithad jurisdiction to review the work of the Commissioner. Lord Justice SimonBrown declared that he could see nothing in the Commissioner’s role or thestatutory framework in which he operated which is ‘so singular as to take himwholly outside the purview of judicial review’. Nevertheless, the court wouldbe slow to review given the breadth of discretion conferred under the Act.
33
The meaning of ‘maladministration’
Maladministration is the key concept relating to the Commissioner’sjurisdiction, but it is not defined in the Act. The concept derives from theWhyatt Report of 1961, where it was described as a term which ‘was not ofprecise meaning’. The failure to define the concept in the Act was deliberate.The minister responsible for introducing the legislation, Mr RichardCrossman, felt that the Act was of such an innovatory nature that time wouldbe needed to adjust to the Act’s introduction and that no rigid criteria shouldbe set. In the House of Commons, Mr Crossman described maladministrationas including ‘bias, neglect, inattention, delay, incompetence, ineptitude,perversity, turpitude, arbitrariness and so on’.
34Chapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law
93032 Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, s 5(1).
33 Cf R v Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex parte Balchin (1997), in which
judicial review was granted, and the Parliamentary Commissioner found to have fallen
into error.
34 Official Report HC 734 Col 51.

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
The courts have examined the concept of maladministration in relation to
the work of Local Government Commissioners. For example, in R v
Commissioners for Local Administration ex parte Bradford Metropolitan Borough
Council (1979) ,maladministration was described as ‘faulty administration’ and
‘bad administration’, whereas, in 1980, Lord Donaldson MR explained thatmaladministration is primarily concerned with the manner in whichauthorities reach or implement decisions, and is not concerned with thequality of the decision itself.
35In R v Local Commissioner for Administration in
the North and North East England ex parte Liverpool City Council (2000), the Courtof Appeal ruled that the failure of local councillors to follow the NationalCode of Local Government Conduct, and failure to observe the requirement todeclare financial interests when taking part in decisions relating to planning,was maladministration. 
Maladministration is a more restrictive concept than is employed in other
jurisdictions. In Denmark, for example, the ombudsman may examine‘mistakes’ and ‘unreasonable decisions’ and, in Norway, the ombudsman caninvestigate decisions which are ‘clearly unreasonable’. In the UnitedKingdom, being tied to the concept of maladministration, the Commissioner isnot concerned with the merits of any decision taken, nor the fairness orotherwise of the rules governing any situation, but rather with the manner ofthe application of the rules.
The Commissioner’s investigation and report
In the exercise of his jurisdiction, the Commissioner is vested with strongpowers by the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. The Commissioner hasthe same powers as a court in respect of requiring the attendance of witnessesand the right of examination, and the production of documents, subject to theprotections of Cabinet proceedings and documents and such information as aperson would not be compelled to disclose to a court of law (section 8). Toobstruct the Commissioner in the performance of his duties under the Act,without lawful excuse, may be certified as a contempt.
Under section 10, where the Commissioner accepts jurisdiction and
investigates a complaint, a report of the findings are sent to the principalofficer of the department concerned and, if the matter has not been remedied,or is unlikely to be, he may lay a special report before each House ofParliament. The Commissioner’s Annual General Report is laid before
parliament. The Commissioner has no power to grant a remedy or to grantcompensation. He does, however, make recommendations as to theappropriate remedy, and as to levels of suitable compensation.
93135 R v Commissioners for Local Administration ex parte Eastleigh Borough Council (1980).

The volume of complaints
The evidence indicates that, whilst a high number of complaints are rejected
(either because they relate to matters not within the Commissioner’sjurisdiction, whether relating to an excluded department or relating to mattersof policy, or because they reveal no prima facie case of maladministration),
once a complaint is admitted for investigation, the prospect of a finding ofmaladministration – at least in part – is high. In 1992, for example, of 186completed investigations, 177 (or 95 per cent) cases were found to revealmaladministration.
In terms of his investigations, the Commissioner has reported that 50 per
cent of his time is consistently devoted to complaints about tax and socialsecurity – the two largest departments in terms of contact with, and effect on,individuals. In 1999–2000, the Department of Social Security was the subject of41 per cent of all referrals, the Inland Revenue the subject of eight per cent.The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1999–2000accounted for 7.5 per cent of complaints. Of the problems encountered interms of maladministration, these are put down to the sheer scale of theadministrative function and the necessary complexity of laws. The impersonalnature of services, the forms and lack of access to administrators andproblems of delay also feature highly.
As to the level of success achieved, the Commissioner reported that, in all
cases where injustice had been found to have occurred throughmaladministration, the remedy proposed by the Commissioner had beenaccepted.
THE PROBLEM OF ACCESSIBILITY 
AND PUBLIC AWARENESS
On accessibility, the Commissioner has questioned his own position.36As
seen, prior to reform, discussed below, access to the Commissioner could onlybe gained through a Member of Parliament, and not directly. Of the 100 plusChapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
national ombudsmen around the world, the British Commissioner was unique
in having no powers of initiative, being dependent upon references from theMP ‘filter’. In the report for 1988, the Commissioner considered the difficultiesin increasing public awareness about the Commissioner’s role and powers,
37
despite regular press notices, press and radio and television interviews andthe booklet available from Citizens Advice Bureaux and public libraries. In theCommissioner’s report of 1990,
38the problem of public awareness was again
alluded to.
The Commissioner himself has noted that public awareness is most
usually raised through some major issue or scandal. Two illustrations may becited. The first major investigation arising out of a number of complaints wasinto the non-payment of compensation by the Foreign Office to 12 personswho had been prisoners of war in the Sachsenhausen camp.
39Monies had
been made available by the German government and distributed by theForeign Office to former detainees. The Commissioner found there had beenmaladministration
40and the government awarded compensation to the
complainants.
The Barlow Clowes affair resulted in hundreds of complaints being made
to the Commissioner concerning the collapse of the Barlow Clowescompany.
41In 1988, the group of companies collapsed, causing significant
losses to shareholders. The Department of Trade and Industry hasresponsibility for licensing such investment companies.
42Following the
company’s collapse, numerous shareholders complained to Members ofParliament, 159 of whom referred the complaints to the ParliamentaryCommissioner. The Commissioner made five findings of maladministrationon the part of the Department of Trade and Industry, including errors, lack ofinformation before making decisions, delay in instigating a formal inquiry, afailure to appreciate that auditors would not find the relevant information andinsufficient rigour in exercising its regulatory role – all of which resulted ininjustice.
The government initially rejected the Commissioner’s findings and
recommendations as to compensation, arguing both that no investment is freeof risk and that those with larger amounts of money should accept a higherlevel of responsibility and therefore loss. The Commissioner expresseddisappointment that the government did not unreservedly accept his report.His recommendation was that compensation should be payable to investors at

a rate of 90 per cent for losses incurred under £50,000, and 85 per cent for
losses under £100,000. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry acceptedthe recommendations, but maintained that the government had no legalliability to compensate investors, and claimed that the Department’s handlingof the case was ‘within acceptable range of standards reasonably to beexpected of regulators’. The Secretary of State went on to say thatcompensation was being made only because of the ParliamentaryCommissioner’s recommendations.
43
The losses caused to egg manufacturers over allegations made by officials
concerning the salmonella virus resulted in charges of maladministration andcompensation of £600,000 being paid by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food.
44The Animal Health Act 198145provided that, where the
salmonella virus was found in flocks, the flock should be slaughtered andcompensation paid for the loss of the healthy birds. No compensation waspayable for the diseased birds. The Ministry fixed the level of compensation –irrespective of the proportion of the flock infected by the virus – at 60 per centof the value of the healthy birds. On investigation, the Commissioner foundthat inadequate compensation had been paid.
46
It has been seen above that the government is, in general, prepared to
accept the findings of the Commissioner and to implement hisrecommendations. In December 1991, the Financial Secretary to theTreasury
47stated that ‘I am not aware of any circumstances in which [the
Parliamentary Ombudsman’s] recommendations have been ignored. This isthe basis on which the government has tended to work – and has, as far as Iam aware, always worked – in that we do accept and implement therecommendations that are made’.
48This commitment was reiterated by the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster49in 1993, when he stated that
‘invariably, in the end, [the government] accepted the Commissioner’s say-so’.
50However, it has also been seen above that, in relation to the Barlow
Clowes affair, the government deviated from this normally accepted practiceand, while prepared to offer compensation, did so ‘without admission of faultChapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law

the prolonged plans to build the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (the CTRL) is a stretch of railway line,
designed to take high speed cross-channel trains. The government’s originalintention was that the CTRL would be financed by the private sector.However, when private funding was not forthcoming, the project could notproceed. In 1990, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that the routewas to be reconsidered. The project was thus kept alive, but uncertaintysurrounded the area of south east England in which it was to built. As a result,thousands of properties were ‘blighted’ and owners unable to sell theirhomes. The route was finally decided in 1994.
In February 1995, the Commissioner
52laid a special report before the
House.53The special report was only the second such report to be made in the
history of the office of Commissioner.54The basis for the laying of a special
report is that the Commission considers that injustice has been caused topersons as a result of maladministration and that the injustice has not been, orwill not be, remedied. In the Commissioner’s report on the CTRL project, theCommissioner considered that maladministration had occurred in theDepartment of Transport between June 1990 and April 1994. TheCommissioner’s view was that the Department of Transport ‘had aresponsibility to consider the position of ... persons suffering exceptional orextreme hardship and to provide for redress where appropriate’
55and that
the government had a duty to consider the position not just of all citizens, butalso of individual citizens harmed by its action. The Commissioner found that‘no special consideration was given to that aspect of good administration andit is on that basis that I criticise the department’.
56The Commissioner
recommended that individuals who had suffered exceptional hardship shouldreceive compensation from the government. The government’s reaction wasto state that it was not its policy to compensate those affected by generalisedblight, and that, in relation to those individuals who had suffered exceptionalhardship, it was too difficult to define criteria to identify such individuals.With this, the Commissioner disagreed. While he accepted that there weredefinitional difficulties, he did not ‘accept at all that it is technically beyond agovernment department’s capabilities’ to establish the relevant criteria.
57
The Commissioner’s report and the government’s response was
considered by the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for
93552 Mr William Reid CB.
53 Pursuant to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, s 10(3).54 The first was in 1977–78, which also involved the Department of Transport.55 Fifth Report of the PCA: The Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Blight , HC 193 (1994–95),

Administration (see, further, below). In its report,58the committee agreed
with the Commissioner’s assessment of the evidence. The committee stated
that:
The department failed to provide any material to contradict this finding when
invited to do so by the committee. At no point was direct and comprehensiveconsideration given to the question of whether it was either desirable orpossible to offer ex gratia compensation to those exceptionally afflicted by the
generalised blight of the CTRL project. 
The committee considered that at the heart of the matter lay the definition of
maladministration. In his annual report for 1993, the Commissioner includedin his definition ‘failure to mitigate the effects of rigid adherence to the letterof the law where that produces manifestly inequitable treatment’.
59Endorsing
this definition, the committee stated that the definition implies:
... an expectation that when an individual citizen is faced with extraordinary
hardship as a result of strict application of law or policy, the executive must beprepared to look again and consider whether help can be given. That thedepartment did not do. It never considered the possibility of distinguishingcases of extreme hardship from the mass of those affected adversely byblight.
60
The committee concluded that:
1(i) ... the Department of Transport should have considered whether any ex
gratia payments were due when the CTRL project entered the period of
uncertainty caused by problems of funding between June 1990 and April1994;
(ii)... it is desirable to grant redress to those affected to an extreme andexceptional degree by generalised blight, in line with the principle thatmaladministration includes a failure to mitigate the effects of rigidadherence to the letter of the law where that produces manifestlyinequitable treatment;
(iii)... it should be possible to distinguish a small number of cases ofexceptional hardship.
The committee recommended that:
... the Department of Transport reconsider its response to the Ombudsman’sfindings, accept his conclusion that maladministration has occurred andconsider arrangements to determine whether there are householders whomerit compensation on the grounds of exceptional hardship. That is very mucha matter for the department’s judgment, a point the Ombudsman emphasised.It would be most regrettable if the department were to remain obdurate. Insuch an event, we then recommend that as a matter of urgency a debate on thismatter be held on the floor of the House on a substantive motion ingovernment time.

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
This highly critical report on the actions of the Department of Transport and
the government’s failure to respond positively to the Commissioner’s reportrepresents a landmark case in the complex tri-partite constitutionalrelationship between the Commissioner, his select committee and parliament,and the executive. In 1997, the government finally agreed to paycompensation of £5,000 to property owners whose property value had beenadversely affected by the delay in reaching decisions over the routing of theCTRL.
62
The Select Committee63
The Parliamentary Commissioner is aided by a select committee, whichconsiders the annual and special reports of the Parliamentary Commissionerand Health Service Commissioner and takes evidence from theCommissioners and others, including government departments and healthauthorities, on matters arising from reports in order to ensure that allreasonable efforts are made to tighten up procedures, prevent the repetition offaults and provide any appropriate remedies.
The Select Committee represents the formal link between the
Commissioner and parliament. The committee is able to exert pressure ongovernment departments to comply with the recommendations of theCommissioner.
The Parliamentary Commissioner and ministerial responsibility
One aspect of the office of Commissioner which caused concern when theoffice was proposed was the relationship between the Commissioner andministers, and the impact of the Commissioner’s office on the doctrine ofministerial responsibility. The view of the government at the time was thatministerial responsibility and the office of the Commissioner wereirreconcilable. As noted above, in the Attorney General’s view, there alreadyexisted ‘adequate provision’ under the constitution for the redress ofgrievances.
JUSTICE replied that:
The Commissioner would help to make ministerial responsibility more
effective. He would penetrate the screen which Ministers interpose betweenMembers of Parliament and government departments and he would keep
93762 See James and Longley, 1996. The Child Support Agency has also attracted a significant
volume of complaints. The number of complaints was such that, in 1994, the
Commissioner took the ‘unprecedented step of declining to investigate fresh individualcomplaints’ other than where they concerned aspects of the Agency’s work which theCommissioner had not yet inquired into. In 1995, complaints against the Child SupportAgency amounted to one quarter of all cases referred to the Commissioner. See Sixth
Report , paras 17–18 and Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Annual Report for
1995 , Cm 296; and see HC 193 (1994–95), London: HMSO.
63 See Gregory, 1982.

Parliament informed about administrative practices which were open to
criticism. The responsibility of the Minister would remain as it is – neithermore nor less.
The government’s policy of making administration more open and accessible
has an impact on the work of the Parliamentary Commissioner. Three majordevelopments reflected this commitment. The Citizen’s Charter provided thatpublic bodies must state their objectives, must publicise the standards ofservice to be expected by consumers and establish complaints procedures fordissatisfied customers.
64Specific services must publish their own
individuated Charter. By March 1994, there were 38 Charters in existence.65
The establishment of ‘Next Step Agencies’,66the task of which is to achieve
greater efficiency in the delivery of public services, also affects the role of theCommissioner. The setting up of Agencies, the head of which are responsiblefor operational matters and accountable to parliament through selectcommittee inquiries, has the effect of reducing the size of the central CivilService and introducing greater management efficiency and accountability.The minister remains responsible to parliament for policy matters. In relationto the Parliamentary Commissioner,
67his powers of investigation, report and
recommendation continue to extend to Agencies. However, complaints madeby the public to Members of Parliament about operational matters are to bedirected to the chairman of the board of the Agency. Complaints regardingmatters of policy remain within the political domain and the responsibility ofministers. 
REFORM OF THE OFFICE OF 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER68
The office of Commissioner suffers from a number of drawbacks. Individualshave – unlike in most other jurisdictions – no right of direct access to theParliamentary Commissioner. The concept of maladministration is relativelynarrow and is linked to injustice suffered as a result of a decision.Furthermore, while the 1987 Act has extended the bodies into which theCommissioner has jurisdiction to investigate, there remain a significantnumber of matters outside his jurisdiction. Many of these relate to matterswhich fall under the royal prerogative,
69which, as has been seen, is subject to
inadequate parliamentary scrutiny and to limited judicial review.Chapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law
93864 See Barron and Scott, 1992. In the six months from July 2001 to January 2002, the
Commissioner upheld complaints against a number of public bodies over the refusal to
disclose information: Access to Official Information: Fifth Report , HC 585 (2002), London:
HMSO. See www.ombudsman.org.uk.
65 See Birkinshaw, 1995, Chapter 1.
66 See Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps , 1988, London: HMSO.
67 And Commissioner for Local Administration.68 See Harlow, 1978; Woolf, 1990; and Gregory and Pearson, 1992.69 See Chapter 7.

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
The question of direct access to the Commissioner was again considered
by the Select Committee in 1993–94.70The committee conducted a survey of
Members of Parliament in order to ascertain their views on the filter. Of the
333 Members who responded, the committee reported that 38.4 per cent werein favour of direct access to the Commissioners, whereas 58.0 per cent wereagainst direct access.
71The committee commented that:
It is clear that many Members value their role as champions of their
constituents’ complaints and are unwilling to see this constitutional function inany way bypassed or diminished.
72
The Commissioner himself, however, argued forcibly that the filter was
‘potentially disadvantageous to complainants’, in part because individualsmay feel that their Member of Parliament would be unwilling to help themand because of the administrative burden on Members of Parliament intransmitting material to the Commissioner. JUSTICE and the NationalConsumer Council also argued for reform of the system. The committeesummarised the objections to the MP filter as follows:
(a) The public should have direct access to the Commissioner as a matter of
right.
(b) The filter is an anomaly, almost unknown in other ombudsman systems.73
No such requirement exists, for instance, in the case of the Health Service
Commissioner.
(c) Individuals with complaints may be unwilling to approach an MP, while
desiring the ombudsman’s assistance.
(d) The filter means that the likelihood of individuals’ cases being referred to
the Commissioner will largely depend on the views and practice of theparticular constituency MP. Some look with more favour on the Office ofthe Commissioner than others.
(e) The filter acts as an obstacle to the Commissioner effectively promoting his
services.
(f) The filter creates an unnecessary bureaucratic barrier between the
complainant and the Commissioner, involving considerable paperwork forMPs and their offices.
74
The committee concluded, however, that the advantages of retaining the filter
system outweighed these significant disadvantages. The committee wasparticularly concerned to retain the role of the Member of Parliament in theinvestigation of complaints, and about the potentially vast increase in thenumber of complaints being received by the Commissioner if the filter wasremoved.

74 HC 33 (1993–94), London: HMSO, para 65.
75 In 2000 a Parliamentary Commissioner (Amendment) Bill, removing the MP filter, was
passed by the House of Lords but rejected by the Commons.

The question of the jurisdictional basis of maladministration has also been
subject to consideration. The JUSTICE-All Souls Report of 198876
recommended no change to the definition.
COMMISSIONERS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, 
SCOTLAND AND WALES 
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each have a Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration with similar powers and functions as theUnited Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner. In Northern Ireland there isalso a Police Ombudsman.
77
THE HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSIONERS
The National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1972 and National Health ServiceReorganisation Act 1973
78introduced separate Health Service Commissioners
for England, Wales and Scotland. The Parliamentary Commissioner forAdministration undertakes the role of Health Service Commissioner. TheCommissioner reports directly to the Secretary of State for Health, but hisreports are laid before both Houses of Parliament and will be considered bythe Parliamentary Commissioner Select Committee.
Jurisdiction
Section 109 of the Health Service Act 1977 provides that the following aresubject to investigation by the Health Commissioner: regional, district andspecial health authorities; family health services authorities; Mental HealthAct Commission; Dental Practice Board; and National Health Service Trusts.
The Commissioner may investigate any matter relating to an alleged
failure to provide a service it is meant to provide, and any other action takenby or on behalf of the authority. The jurisdiction is thus much broader than‘maladministration’. However, the complaint must be one which involvesinjustice or hardship suffered as a result of failures under the two headings forcomplaint. Individuals have the right of direct access to the Commissioner.
Excluded matters
Section 116(2)(b) of the Health Service Act 1977 provides that theCommissioner shall not investigate complaints about services provided byChapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law

family doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists. This broad exclusion was
justified on the basis that the services provided are provided independently,under contracts with local family health services authorities which havejurisdiction to adjudicate on complaints. The most significant exclusion fromjurisdiction related to clinical decisions. The Health Service Commissioners(Amendment) Act 1996, however, extends the jurisdiction of health servicecommissioners. Section 6 removed the statutory bar which prevented theCommissioner from investigating complaints concerning clinical judgment,thus correcting one of the most significant former jurisdictional exclusions.
Service committees which consider allegations against doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists originally could not be investigated by theCommissioner, under Schedule 13, paragraph 19 of the National HealthService Act 1977. Personnel matters were also excluded, as are commercialtransactions, and inquiries set up by the Secretary of State into aspects of theNational Health Service. Sections 1 and 2 of the Health Service Commissioners(Amendment) Act 1996, however, now bring the providers of general medical,dental, ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services and people in theindependent sector who provide services to NHS patients within theCommissioners’ jurisdiction. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONERS79
The Local Government Act 1974 established Commissioners for LocalAdministration, for England and Wales. England is divided into three areas,each represented by one or more Commissioners.
80The Scottish system is
established under Part II of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975.Commissioners are appointed by the Crown and hold office ‘during goodbehaviour’.
Jurisdiction
The Commissioners have jurisdiction to investigate any complaint ofmaladministration involving council committees, their Members and officersof the council. Police authorities and water boards are also subject toinvestigation.
81The Local Government Act 198882brings development
corporations and the Commission for New Towns within the Commissioner’sjurisdiction. Since 1989, the public has the right of direct access to theCommissioner, a reform which resulted in a 44 per cent increase in complaints
94179 Recommended by the JUSTICE Report, The Citizen and His Council: Ombudsmen for Local
Government? , 1969; and see the White Paper , Reform of Local Government in England , 1970,
London: HMSO. See, also, Yardley, 1983; and Birkinshaw, 1995.

82 Local Government Act 1988, s 29, Sched 3.

by the year ending March 1989 and by March 1990 in a further 25 per cent
increase in complaints.
Maladministration causing injustice
The concept of maladministration used for the Parliamentary Commissioner isadopted for the Local Commissioners. Maladministration resulting in injusticehas been found to include incomplete record keeping and the failure to givereasons for decisions, and a finding of maladministration may be made wherean authority fails to have adequate complaints procedures. Inadequate schoolplaces, and unreasonable delays in processing applications for improvementgrants have also been found to amount to maladministration. Shortages ofstaff and financial resources will not excuse a council from a finding ofmaladministration.
Section 31 of the Act provides that an authority need only consider a
Commissioner’s report if it has been found that the maladministration inquestion has resulted in injustice. Mere maladministration is not enough.
Remedies
Where a finding of maladministration resulting in injustice has been made,section 31 of the Local Government Act 1974 imposes a duty on authorities toconsider the report and to advise the Commissioner of any action taken tocomply with the findings, or proposed action. Section 31 of the 1974 Act hasbeen amended to provide that authorities may make ‘any payment’ to theaggrieved person that it thinks appropriate.
Not every decision of the Commissioners will be accepted. In 1986, for
example, the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner noted that19 per cent of local authorities who had adverse reports made by theCommissioners had ignored the recommendations.
83The Local Government
and Housing Act 1989 provides that local authorities have three months inwhich to respond to the Commissioner’s report and that they should notifythe Commissioner of any action taken, or action which they are proposing totake in response to his report.
84If the Commissioner is not satisfied with the
response he may issue a further report. Where the local authority proposesnot to act in response to the report, the matter must be referred to a fullcouncil meeting; see, further, Chapter 10.Chapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law

Commissioners for Administration: ‘Ombudsmen’
Excluded matters
Schedule 5 to the Local Government Act excludes matters relating to the
internal regulation of schools, personnel matters, action taken concerning thecommencement of legal proceedings and criminal investigations, commercialand contractual matters.
Judicial review and Commissioners for Administration
Judicial review of decisions of Commissioners is an available form of redress,although the breadth of discretion conferred on Commissioners often renderstheir decisions beyond challenge. In Law Debenture Trust Group plc v Pensions
Ombudsman (1999), the Chancery Division allowed an appeal against a finding
of maladministration by the Pensions Ombudsman. The complainant hadapplied to trustees of his pension scheme for early retirement following aninjury. The trustees concluded that he was not incapacitated, having carriedout video surveillance. The court ruled that the only basis available to theOmbudsman for overturning the decision of the trustees was on the ground ofperversity, and that such a finding would have to be expressed in clear termsin the Ombudsman’s decision, which had not been done. Further, a finding ofperversity could only be made after consideration of the Wednesbury criteria
with respect to unreasonableness. The Ombudsman was wrong to find thatsurveillance per se amounted to maladministration.
In R v Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex parte Balchin (1998),
the Queen’s Bench Division quashed a decision of the ParliamentaryCommissioner. The Commissioner had found maladministration in relation toproperty blighted by a road scheme in Norfolk, but following judicial reviewhis decision was quashed, whereupon a second ombudsman investigated thematter. The second decision included fresh findings based on new evidence. Itwas disputed whether the Commissioner had made a finding as to whether, ifthere had been any maladministration, that had caused any injustice to theapplicants. The court held that the decision on maladministration was flawedsince his reasoning was inadequate, and that there had been a failure to givereasons for findings on the principal controversial issues. The application wasgranted and certiorari ordered.
Complaints
Housing matters form the basis for approximately 40 per cent of complaintseach year, with complaints about planning accounting for approximately 30per cent of complaints. Education, social services, local taxation andenvironmental health each comprise approximately five per cent ofcomplaints.
943

THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
The Freedom of Information Act 2000, discussed in Chapter 24, represents a
step in the direction of more open government by conferring on citizens alegal right, subject to limited exceptions, to access to information held bypublic bodies. An Information Commissioner has been appointed who isindependent of parliament and accountable to the courts. The Commissioner’sjurisdiction comes into play after there has been a complaint made to adepartment or other public body, and that body has conducted an internalinquiry which produces no satisfactory outcome. Complaints are made by thepublic via a Member of Parliament. The Commissioner has wide powers toinvestigate complaints, including the right of access, under warrant, to enterand search the records of public authorities and, where it is suspected thatinformation is being, or will be, suppressed, to remove that information. Thereis no right of appeal from the Commissioner to the courts, but his or herdecisions are amenable to judicial review. The Commissioner lays an annualreport before parliament, and issues reports on investigations undertaken. 
EUROPEAN UNION AND COMMUNITY OMBUDSMAN85
The Treaty on European Union 1992 introduced the office of ombudsman,appointed by the European Parliament. Under Article 195, the ombudsman isappointed for the life of a Parliament, and may be removed by the Court ofJustice, at the request of the Parliament, on the basis that ‘he no longer fulfilsthe conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he is guilty ofserious misconduct’. The ombudsman is completely independent in theexercise of his duties, and may not seek or take instructions from any body.
Citizens of the European Union have the right of direct access to the
ombudsman, and complaints may be referred by a Member of the EuropeanParliament. The ombudsman has jurisdiction to hear complaints relating toinstitutions of the Union and to require national government bodies toprovide information relating to complaints. Where a finding ofmaladministration is made, the matter is referred to the relevant institutionwhich has a period of three months in which to respond. The ombudsmansubmits an annual report to the European Parliament. The complaint mustrelate to maladministration on the part of institutions of the Union. TheEuropean Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, acting in theirjudicial role, are excluded from the ombudsman’s jurisdiction.Chapter 26: Constitutional and Administrative Law
